To put it simply, Apple's new iBook is an engineering marvel.  The design is sleek and elegant, yet the case can stand up to a good beating.  The iBook comes with an awesome set of features--pretty much everything you might need is already part of the package, including FireWire, CD-RW drive, and 10/100 Ethernet.  Despite having a relatively small screen (12.1" diagonal) compared to some PC laptops, it still supports a full 1024 x 768 resolution at millions of colors. The screen is very bright, and the battery, while not quite the 5-hour powerhouse that Apple advertises, still manages about three hours doing normal operations. The 500-MHz G3 processor is spritely and gets things done quickly, although it doesn't have quite enough power to do a large amount of movie editing or graphics work.
A few drawbacks are as follows:
The internal CD burner is only 8x at this time, which is markedly slower than the 16x and 20x external FireWire burners available now.
The iBook comes with only 128 mb of RAM, which is just barely enough for most things.  I would strongly encourage upgrading to at least 256 mb total, as RAM is very inexpensive these days.
The video memory in the iBook is only 8 mb, with a weak graphics controller as compared to what goes into the G4 desktops.  As such, the iBook is only mediocre at gaming.
The 10GB hard drive is already pre-loaded with almost 5GB of software and sample mp3's, so I would highly recommend upgrading to at least a 20 GB drive.
In conclusion, the iBook is a solid purchase for anyone who wants many of the features of a desktop machine, but in a portable package.  The drawbacks listed above are mostly forgiveable, as sacrifices had to be made somewhere to make this such a reasonably-priced machine.  The new iBook no longer has a built-in carrying handle, but Apple has managed to trim quite a bit of weight and bulk, making it a joy to use on a daily basis.
Very pleased with this purchase. It was a gift for my boyfriend and it works beautifully. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a dependable computer at a cheap price.
i like this product because it was a great price and it works very well. this product also arrived a lot sooner than i thought it would.
NOT SATISFIED WITHNTHIS PRODUCT AT ALL. CAN NOT ACCESS THE INTERNET NO MATTER WHAT I TRY AND HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET ANY HELP FROM THE SELLER NOR A REFUND FOR THE PRODUCT
I am EXTREMELY disappointed and feel cheated. The computer turned on for all of 10 minutes and I have not been able to turn it on since then! What a waste of my hard earned limited income! I will NEVER buy another used electronic item. I feel like I just gave my money away!
I really do not like the product that I got. It is not willing to connect to the internet, i've tried numerous ways. The screen does not want to turn on unless its in a certain position which makes it impossible to type and read at the same time. I am really disappointed in this product.
I absolutely hate this product. I'm a single parent and bought this as a Christmas gift for my 2 sons. I never thought that a laptop in this day would not have a wireless card. They were so excited to finally have their first computer. Needless to say, they haven't touched it since the day after Christmas. It was a complete waste of my money and I can't afford to replace it! I would never recommend this product to anyone.
Originally the Apple iBook Laptop that I received was not the requested 600-MHz PowerPC G3, 128 MB RAM, 20 GB hard drive. When the seller was made aware of this, they immediately sent me not just the originally requested laptop, but an upgraded 800mhz/256mb RAM/30gb HDD model, as well as a partial refund!
Thanks to exceptional service by this seller, I now have an excellent computer.
This laptop held up great during shipping. No damage at all.  I received it quickly as well. It's been holding up great so far.  It's perfect for what I use it for.
I just feel the Apple is OK. I have not used it. I got it all wrong that it has a DVD drive, but no it is s CD Drive. The specs did not show clearly that it has no DVD drive. I hope I can learn more about apple using this.
I am one of those switchers (apple.com/switch). I worked on mac 5 years ago, loved it but couldn't afford one. So I have spent the last 5 years in the PC family. Just bought the iBook. It's absolute perfection. No problem to switch files, so easy to use. I now have an ipod, a digital camera. I completely (re)adopted Mac's digital life.
Have no fear to get rid of your PC and ride a Mac. You will notice the difference.
This is simply the best computer I've owned.  I've owned PC's and Macs.  No doubt, Macs are by far superior.  I wish I could afford another [$$$] for a G4 powerbook, but since I can't, I got this one.  I can't believe the power, versatility, and the attention from others.  As someone who writes software, and attends school full time as a law student, this computer does it all.  My only complaint, hard-drive is small, so I bought an external firewire drive to store non-essential data.  Dang, firewire is fast.  Also, I have an iPod.  It is of no "Practical" use, but try and take it from me and ....well.... the won't let me say it here.  Let's just say, I love it.
BUY and APPLE, if you can afford a G4 powerbook, get one.  If not, trust another developer the G3 is still kick - a**.
You can't have everything. At least, not at 1,199 bucks.
The bottom-of-the-line iBook is exactly what it should be: Extremely portable and extremely friendly. Extremely fast? Not.
This is a compromise machine -- the screen is small and the processor is the slowest available on a Mac. At 12.1 inches, the screen is among the smallest you will find on a laptop nowadays, but it is super-sharp. And the fairly pokey processor is still more than adequate for word processing and iTunes and some basic graphics applications, and for surfing the web. Also, 128 MB of RAM is downright puny in today's computing world. You'll definitely want to upgrade to at least 256 MB.
Now, for the good part. By making those compromises, the iBook is not only cheap, it is light -- under 5 pounds. Check out a similarly equipped laptop from your weekly Bestbuy ad, and you will see behemoths weighing in at 6, 7, 8 or even 9 pounds! And you will rarely find one this thin, and never one this cool.
Battery power on the iBook also far outshines its PC competition, helped in part by that small screen and slow processor.
This is basically the perfect machine for someone on the go -- including reporters like me -- or for a K-12 student.
If these compromises are simply too much for you, Apple has an alternative for you -- the no-compromises, 5.4 pound, 1-inch thick, super-fast Titanium Powerbook G4. It's your choice.
You get what you pay for.
This is my first laptop, although mine specificly has the dvd/cdrw combo and the 20 gig drive. I bought it to replace my then 6yo 9500, which died of burned out motherboard. The iBook was supposed to be a temporary fix, until a G5 desktop came out. Now that I have used this model for almost 9 months I think my next Mac will be an iBook. I do graphics, and the 12" screen is not hard to deal with. The extra cable, from Apple, lets me hook up to a TV, stereo, or projector. The included monitor adapter lets me hook up to a monitor for a dual screen. I hope the next iBook I get will let me have an additional screen, instead of mirroring. The only things I would want for my next model would be the Superdrive, to burn CDs & DVDs, a longer life battery, and a G5 cpu (ha!). Right now, in OS X, I can get about 3 hours of battery, unless I play a game. Illustrator, GoLive, & LiveMotion all work fine in X. Hopefully I will find out how Photoshop 7 works on Monday! I have used several desktop models, including a G4 at work, and the quaint, quiet iBook has out-charmed them all. One other thing: at home I use a full size keyboard & mouse, and external speakers. HTH!
I own the new 14.1" 2002 iBook, and these computers are awesome.  OS X aquaface is absolutely stunning, and all the new products for OS X such as Microsoft X, Acrobat 5, are 10 X better to look at than their predacesors of OS 9.  I can't wait for Photoshop in OS X!  The speed with the preinstalled 256MB Ram is a little too slow for my taste, but after installing a 512MB/PC-133 dimm to bump me up to 640MB, I am cruzing at lightening speeds. Even Mac haters have admitted to me being enchanted by the outer and inner appearance of the glamorous icebook.  Oh, the second one purchased is my husbands (a die hard Windows user)! Ha!
1000 words just isn't enough to express my love for this baby.
In point form then :
: floppy's out cd-rw is in.
: Every software that's reloaded rocks .
: every reloaded software is of professional level.
: Os x beats all the other Windows (xp, me,2000 pro, 98,95)
: Os x is the most stable one that i have use compared to Windows (xp, me,2000 pro, 98,95 ) trust me i have used all of Windows (xp, me,2000 pro, 98,95 ) and none compared to Os x
: Os x is the most fun-to-use os
: Os x is the most beautiful os i have seen
: As for the speed of the processor 600Mhz is equivalent to that of pentium 3 1 ghz or some where there
: a 15 gb hdd is enough .
: iBook is the most beautiful laptop i have seen
hey man it's award winning what else do you ask for.
It's a bit too expensive if it's on the shelf when it's on your lap you'll know it's worth it. it's worth every penny.
it's a pc squeezed into a a 1.5" magnesium casing. the whole iBook is made with ruggedness in mind.
If you are trying to decide between this ibook and the more expensive powerbook, go for this one.  Why pay more, when this one has everything you need? This is a laptop that you can take everywhere an there's no need to fear a few bumps or knocks because this ibook seems pretty sturdy. Plus, the DVD/CDRW drive beats the rest of the notebooks hands down. I've only had mine 3 weeks, but so far, it really rocks!
If your using this computer strictly for the internet there are advantages and disavantages it is not good with aol just like all macs thats all i can say. If you are intrested in aol i HIGHLY recomend ibm by all means .There are advantages though mac has a airport which is a very convienent wireless modem btu does not work aol. I own the ibook and  a ibm and i love aol and mac just doesnt compare to a ibm with that. If you prefer mac then this is a good choice. There are better mac laptops out there but this is great. Its a little heavy but the handle is very supportive and trusty.the speed is preety fast.as you probalby know mac doesnt allow downloading any window programs unless you buy the make your mac compatible to windows program thing. The imovie is great. It does not come with games such as solitare or anything that would come with an ibm comp. and its a little  unconvienent looking for software in mac all the time. There is alot of room to rest your palms which i like. But jsut like all laptops u must be very careful with the charger ive broken mine previously without even being rough and they are exspensive to replace. I like the computer but it realy does depend on your use for it
This is by far the best toy I have ever bought. It's absolutely beautiful, both the hardware and the operating system (OS X). I bought it primarily to edit digital video of my new baby. It's elegantly simple to download the video into iMovie and extremely intuitive to edit the video. I upgraded the hard drive to 30 gigs and the RAM to 256 Megs in order to give myself some head room. I thought I might not like the small screen but it seems not much less viewing area than my 17" desktop monitor. I bought the iBook instead of the Titanium PowerBook because the PowerBook does not offer the DVD/CD-RW combo drive. I wanted to be able to burn the videos I made to CD as well as backup and archive files on my hard drive. I bought a mouse (Apple's optical mouse) beacuse I generally don't like trackpads. The single complaint I have is that the USB port is on the left side of the machine and I have to run the cord for the mouse under the computer to use it with my right hand. Otherwise I am extremely satisfied with my purchase.
I bought the one with a 20 GB hard drive, and I have since put an extra 256 MB memory in it. This machine is wonderful because it is so light, and yet it is powerful enough to run OS X, and just about any software you want to throw at it. It is dynamite on airport networks. I move mine between home and work i.e. between two airport networks, and that is really easy and convenient. The screen is just the right size for a portable, and really easy to read, and clear as crystal. If you want speed, go for the higher CPU speeds and the higher bus speed, but I have been very happy with the 66 MHz bus and 500 MHz processor. It is fine for everyday work. If you really want to move fast, use your desktop. I use a dual processor G4 with two screens when I really need to move fast during the day. However, my ibook is always on, in use for my calendar and for backups, resting by the side of my desktop screens. I would not be without it. At home it is my main machine, where I do all my work stuff. What amazes me is how many applications I can keep open and in use for hours under OS X. No crashes, lots of flexibililty to keep many things going at once. Absolute magic! The really neat thing is when you meet a PC maven, or even a G4 Powerbook, the other machines are so BIG! This ibook is wonderful on the road. I have carried my ibook around in a ordinary bag, not a padded computer bag, for a week at at time, bumping about, with no ill effects, either on the computer or on my shoulder!
I add this comment over a year later.  I stand by what I said above, except that the hinge on the screen is giving me trouble now.  The computer needs to warm up for a while before I can put the screen in its fully opened position. Eventually, I am going to have it fixed.
I bought a 500 MHz ibook.
While it's true that the 10 GB model does fill up rather quickly - be realistic - a laptop is a toy, unless you're truly using it as a total desktop replacement.  I actually do more of my daily work on my ibook now than my regular Pentium 4 station - and that's a good thing.  My ibook rocks..  now I just need an ipod.  Granted, you will need to up the ram.  I'm maxing mine out at 640 MB.  I read one reviewer saying it was hard to exchange files between PC's & Macs...  but exchanging files between pc & mac platforms isn't hard.  Some programs haven't come to mac yet, but I seem to like the programs that mac has better - for example, itunes rules...
Anyway, I'm not gonna ramble anymore - just face the facts.  Apple builds an excellent laptop (it's really eye-catching, and sturdy), and when you compare the two, there's no reason to get a PC laptop, in my view (though tons of people still do).  :)
This thing is the best, I checked one out latly...IT ROCKS!
An exceptional product and an excellent deal. I recommend getting some extra RAM anywhere online, very easy to install yourself. Fabulous graphics, the screen is perfection, great sound, wonderful word processing, iTunes, iMovie, the greatest two operating systems, 9.2 and X. It's beautiful and useful to anyone. Perfect in every way. And weighs less than five pounds. Surpasses all of its price and tech counterparts.
The latest iBooks are pretty much the opposite of the very first Blueberry and Tangerine iBooks.  They have a faster system bus, much more RAM, much bigger hard drives and they've lost the garish colors.  Perhaps most importantly, they've trimmed all the fat off making the iBook almost a sub-notebook.  Despite this, they're loaded with features and are the perfect laptops for student or business person wanting to travel light.
With a 600MHz G3 (approx. 1.2 GHz pentium) and 128 MB RAM, this little computer is a deceptive powerhouse. Portability, durability, and ease of use are the traditional accolades for Mac laptops, but this one is the first to pack real value. The new operating system, the faster chip, and the added storage space make the iBook a perfect investment for college students or business people on the go. With a DVD player, iMovie to edit digital movies, iTunes to manage MP3 files, Palm software built in, and free word processing software all included, the iBook is ready to become the hub of your digital lifestyle.
Apple has reinvented the iBook as one of the best laptops. Not just Mac, but in all of the PC world. The second generation of this version has a faster processor, a larger hard drive, and still looks great. People are drawn to look at this machine from the time you pull it from it's case. I would certainly recommend a RAM upgrade. 128 is okay, but it is just barely getting by. I'd suggest at least doubling that. Since the iBook only has one RAM slot, you may want to do that on ordering. However, you can get quality chips for less from other sources, and since it's a fairly simple install you can do it yourself in a few minutes.
I use my iBook as a webmaster with Macromedia Dreamweaver and Fireworks, Adobe Photoshop, and iMovie 2. My digital camera mounts as an external hard drive. My digital video camera links through the Firewire port with no fuss at all.
Overall, I would highly recommend the iBook.
First off, I think it is important to note that the rating I give the iBook is as a consumer portable.  The iBook is NOT meant to replace a desktop machine.  It is not designed, built or sold for heavy duty graphics,  professional photo or video editing, or desktop publishing.  The iBook IS designed to be very light weight,  easy to use, and flexible.  It is designed for the hobbiest, or consumer that wants the ability to edit their vacation pictures and videos, surf the internet, e-mail freinds and family, and generally do what any computer can do given the limitations that any portable will have.
The iBook comes with both OS9 and OSX pre installed.  It also comes with a very usefull suite of productivity software that includes:  1.  AppleWorks-  A suite of software that includes a more then competant word processor, A spread sheet, A data base, A presentation module and others.  Basically a suite similar to Microsoft Office but not as robust and not costing 400-500 bucks.  It also comes with iTunes, and excellent software for listening to and burning your MP3's.  For those creative people it also comes with iMovie, the best consumer video editing softer available bar none.  Also software listed is also OSX compatible (though it may require software updates.
Now that OSX version 10.1 is becoming available (I just upgraded my iBook to 10.1 today), OSX is a very viable every day OS.  10.1 adds an excellent DVD player and enhanced performance, however as any totally new OS, it will take some time for some software to migrate.  It is also an exceptionally stable operating system.  In the three plus months that I've had my iBook, I can honestly say that the operating system (OSX) has never crashed on me.  I have ofcourse had applications crash, but I've never had to restart.
Yes, the lack of a 100Mhz+ front side bus might be considered a short coming by some, however for the average home user that does not do heavy duty video editing or other extremely demanding applications on a regular basis they will rarely if ever notice this.  Another short coming some may consider is the lack of a PC slot or docking capabilities.  However, with two USB ports, one FireWire port, VGA port (and cable included), built in 10/100 ethernet and a built in 56k modem I'm hard pressed to think what I would need them for.  As for that reviewer that warned anyone from buying an Apple product due to their support all I can say is I've been using Macs for 8 years now.  I've never had one of my computers in the shop for any reason.  I suppose there is always that possibility of a lemmon.  I have probably called Apples support line 4-5 times in that eight years and they have always been able to fix any problem I had while I was on the phone with them.
In short, while your millage may vary, in the 3-4 months that I've had my iBook I have had absolutely no problems with it and can recommend it whole heartedly with a clear conscience.
Almost all of the SPECs on this baby are just what you want in a laptop -- fast processor, just over 1 inch thick case, less than 5 pounds, 5-hour battery. In person, you won't believe how small and truly portable this machine is. It's great for reporters on the go such as myself, or for students in a dorm room. It has all the right ports, and appears to be made with quality in mind.
The screen is exceptionally bright as well.
My only two complaints: 1) The low-end model skimps horribly on the memory (for shame, Apple! They could have added another 64 MB). You can upgrade the memory easy enough aftermarket, but that's an annoyance (128MB is practically required for OS X, BTW).
2) The screen is a fairly miserly 12.1 inches, although it is active-matrix and high-resolution. Now, keep in mind that this contributes to the low-cost, svelte form factor and long battery life, but I wouldn't mine having a 13-14 inch screen when I'm squinting at text all day. I generally solve this problem by upping the size of the fonts, but still, this screen is rather small. If you buy one of the higher-end models, say the one with the DVD drive, you may find that watching a DVD on this small screen is not exactly the cinematic dream that you find on the amazing Titanium Powerbook G4 (with its glorious ultrawide 15.3" screen.)
Enjoy!
This new iBook is the best portable computer on the market.  Its capabilities are outstanding, the build quality is exceptional, the design is stunningly clean and efficient.  This is a do anything, be anything computer that you can proudly use in just about any setting, for almost any computing task you can imagine.  Sure, a new titanium G4 is faster, but it is so delicate looking I would be afraid of breaking it in daily use.  Also, the iBook is roughly half the price.  Even PC users are enamored with the iBook's style and capabilities.  You will not regret a decision to buy this computer.
This labtop notebook is one of the best things you can possibly get. Capable for all ages. This will be on everybody's gift list like how it is on mines.
Compaq 2701 does not work at the moment, because of some problems with Windows XP. It never happened neither to my previous Compaq Presario 1694 nor to the desktops I used. In addition, no restore cd, nor an application/drivers cd were included, so I can not do anything myself with this problem.
the machine is blazingly fast when you consider the fact that it is a notebook but i think it could be better with an amd athlon 4 processor the dual optical bays are an awesome feature this is an overall outstanding machine.
Everything about this laptop probably works great as it was intended to (e.g., MS Office, web browsing).
However, I had a problem with DVD playback--the playback was stuttering. After researching on the web, I disabled the ACPI--the video card and sound card were sharing the same ICQs, and it worked fine.
And then when I play Wolfenstein, the game would hard freeze (I have to hard reboot to regain control of the laptop) randomly every 5 - 20 minutes into the game.
The same thing happens with Everquest (Luclin) as well. But, at least I get the play the game a little bit longer--20 - 45 minutes in the game it would freeze the same way.  I have tried everything. The game was barely playable before I disable the ACPI. But, by disabling it, it will play for a while and crashes.
I tried putting Win2k on it--hoping that it was some driver issue I was facing, but suffer the same fate. May be I have a defective machine or something.
I don't know if I should bother contact the COMPAQ Technical support.
My system  (Presario 2701US) locks up after 20 days old. When I was looking for the restore CD, I found an piece of paper saying that i must order later. I will never buy a Compaq system again.
Contrary to one of the previous reviews, this laptop DOES come with both an image restore cd AND an application/drivers cd as well. I'm using it as I type this review! I have also replaced the XP Home edition with XP Pro. No problems with the Home Edition of XP but I need Pro for business purposes. THIS IS A GREAT LAPTOP! I used to own an IBM Thinkpad which I adored because of it's reliability and sleek performance. (May it rest it peace...) The Presario 2701 smokes it speed wise and has proven to be very reliable in the field. The PIII Chip performs expectedly fast and the 512 MB of RAM gives it plenty of room to work with. The Toshiba CD-R has buffer underrun protection which came as a wonderful surprise. No more burning CD Coasters! Most laptops I checked out didn't have this benefit. The dual-optical bays allow for a DVD-ROM drive so I never have to switch CDs! I get looks of amazement when people see CD trays pop from both sides of the laptop. The big screen is a godsend and is crystal clear at 1400x1050, especially when using XP's Cleartype technology. The Radeon Mobility card is great with 3-D applications and games. Its run every 3-d application and game I've thrown at it. (i.e. Bryce, Max Payne, etc...) Lastly, the speakers are the best I've ever heard. [...] The richness and full bass that emitted from the JBL speakers blew away the rest. I really think this laptop is a terrific powerhouse of functions and should provide more than enough for both the Power User and computer enthusiast.
It does NOT come with the restore CD and the driver CD, so if the system need to be reloaded, you simply can't!!  I talked to the Compaq customer service, she said it does not come with one!!  So good luck.  But so far, this is a nice machine, wishing they will make one with a faster HD.
After comparing and testing most major brand notebook in the market, I found that compaq 2700US has good value in both price and performance. Compared to 1700US, the new model has two optic drive design. That can prevent the user from swapping the drives can make me be easy to do my works!
Of course, it's fashion design makes it looks much better than other major brand products ! It's performance is terrific! I got good and smooth performance when running XP in 1GHz and 256MB! Even much faster than running WINME!!
If you wanna buy a high peroformance, fashion design, all-in-one, and good price notebook, then compaq 2700US is your best choice!
Oh NO!!
I just love this laptop it has the BEST sound I've ever heard in a laptop and a great screen.
The problem is it doesn't run dvds at the proper speed. It comes with windvd and when I'm trying a disney animation it's reporting that it's using like 99 percent of system resources. My God...I have a 475 mghz amd on an Hp with 8 megs of shared memory and it can run dvds smoothly. This is a duron 900 with I think 16 shared and even using the windows media player absorbing 57 percent of resources it still won't play smoothly. I mean the video is ghosting, and video and audio is choppy.
This is really a sweet laptop for the price especially after rebate...if it just would play dvds..I'd be a happy geek:-)
Any advice would be appreciated...hopefully I'm doing something wrong. I've checked system settings and everything seems to be in order but maybe in my despair I'm missing something. Please help!
Kindest regards,
LJ
This is a great computer, the only flaw I can find is in the graphics card.  If you want a laptop for gaming, this is not your laptop.  (For serious portable gamers, try a Dell 8100 with a 16 or better yet a 32 MB NVidea Graphics card) If you want a nice reliable, speedy, desktop replacement, then this is the computer for you. The Athlon chip combined with the 256 MB of memory makes for a speedy response time.  The screen is nice and clear and the keyboard is quiet.  Overall, the computer is a great choice!
I received this as a graduation present to get me through 4 years of college, and so far has been doing a decent job. Before I left for college, I had several problems with it, however.
I don't remember the exact order that these things happened, but after owning it for a few months, it all of a sudden stopped recognizing the touchpad! I hadn't done anything differently from what I usually do, either. I hadn't even been moving the thing around much (this was my primary computer and I kept it at home most of the time). After contacting tech support (which is free for the first year) and unsuccessfully trying to re-format my hard drive with the included Restore Discs, I finally had to ship it off to Compaq to get it repaired (also free for the first year). Two weeks later, I received it and everything worked fine again.
Other problems have been intermittent, such as the computer occasionally deciding to turn itself off all by itself, or failing to start up properly.
Compaq/Hewlett Packard tech support is utterly useless. Whenever I called I got some person that barely spoke English and their instructions were always unclear. Also, no matter what the problem was, their advice was ALWAYS to format the hard drive and then call back. Gee, thanks guys. This doesn't help when you can't start up. I was only given the run-around (transferred to the wrong people over and over again) one time, so I'm assuming this was just a fluke and doesn't usually happen.
I have been at college for about 5 months now, and have had no major problems except a faulty Ethernet port that could only be fixed by buying a ... PC card that plugs into the side. I have heard from a few sources that this is a common problem with Compaq Laptops.
Overall, not very good for processor intensive games (Like Unreal Tournament or Warcraft 3), but great for sound editing, picture tweaking, internet applications, and just fiddling around with.
My roomate got a Hewlett Packard laptop with just about the same specs, and for about the same price, if not a little less. If I had a choice, I would probably go with the HP, now.
Hope this review helps!
This was a fine unit till I got to know it better!
1. Will not play DVD's
2. Battery goes dead fast
3. Lost everything via the blue screen lock ups 3 times so far
4. Case has developed cracks at the stress point of hinges
5. Sent my 700 in for case replacement....Compaq told me I had abused the 700....they wanted [$$$] to fix...I told them that was not true....and send me the 700 back, I felt my 700 was not worth [$$$]...I will Never buy a Compaq again...I am going to glue a chunk of plastic over the hinges and throw it away when it dies!
I'm putting this review on several of the Compaq laptop systems since they are all from the same platform
1. The offer and rebates did not apply from Compaq, but only from an authorized reseller.
2. Right out of the box the 700z system had Driver errors and a bad modem. Corporate tech support sugested that I return it and buy another through a reseller.
3. They then took 2 months to clear up my account for financing after I returned the system but meanwhile I bought a newer system - a 705us.
4. The rebate went through and everything was working okay until the floppy drive went bad, which occured in four weeks. It never wrote to the hard drive and I couldn't copy to or from other disks onto any other computer.
5. I called tech support and they sent out a box for repair pickup and told me the turnaround would be 3-5 days. Well, it took over 4 weeks to get the system back.
6. The repair shop failed to recognize that the second system was mine and did not follow through with repairs even when all the proper paperwork was channeled through support on the phone. I also seemed to get tech swupport in India when I called during certain business hours, and they were not help at all!
7. I wish they could dumped the hard drive info on to a refurbished 2710 system that has a better track record. As it is I'll use this until I get the funds for another system.
My advice is to wait until they get the bugs worked out on this system. They don't even have a Docking station yet, but they'll tell you the part number to order the "phantom" station.
In their defense they have tried to compensate me by sending memory to update my system but they've sent the wrong memory twice!
I'm giving it 2 stars since it worked beautifully when it was up and running and the screen is clear and bright! Oh, the DVD player on my system works great and I've played it through my TV with no complaints!
Now the problem is the memory that was sent to me.  The 256k chip freezes the system and I've tried to get it fixed but calling tech support only adds to the frustration.
The presario 700 is a very good PC for business and home use but with two problems so far I relise that when I am playing games or running 3D programmes the PC freezes up. ALso Over heating is a big problem you need a portable fan at all times, the bois programme is not helping at all. Also the battery life is to short. I think compaq should try tp fix this problem or they will lose customers like me and on the other hand I am also returning this laptop.
I'm going to return mine ... this unit locks up regularly due to overheating problems...The bios upgrade didn't fix anything... leaving a desktop fan blowing over the unit does.
Also the battery life is horrible... under 2 hours for regular use.
Nice speakers and seems fast enough when running.
I bought the 730us through Circuit City for 899.99. For this price, you get a great deal. But Compaqs seeem to have a lot of problems and are usually hit or miss. I know a couple of people who bought this laptop, and some said they worked great while others say they had problem right out of the box. First of all, I was lucky, and I had no problems and it works very well. And it is well worth the price. The only thing that I wish is that it had a cd rw, but you do pay for what you get and then some. I suggest that if you are going to buy one, you should put out the extra 250 or so dollars and buy the 4 year replacement plan. So if it goes bad you can get a new one. Another piece of advies that I would recommend is that you SHOULD NOT BUY IT FROM EBAY OR ANY OTHER COMPANY THAT DOES NOT OFFER A RETURN POLICY. Hope this helped.
I am a College Student who bought this computer as a desktop replacement. I have had no problems since I bought it about a month ago. I have watched 1 DVD on it (which worked great), and play SimCity 3000 ALL the time with no problems.
I highly recommend this computer to anyone who needs a desktop replacement. The sound system is EXCELLENT! You can even change the sound around to increase/decrease echo etc.
Since the computer was so cheap, if you have problems with the DVD rom, you could really go buy a DVD player separate .... This notebook is absolutely amazing!
This notebook has satisfied me from day one (which was Christmas) save for one problem. Fast processor, clear screen, sufficient ram, a cd-rw/dvd player, many ports, easy to use.  However, I use my laptop primarily to play computer games, and I have encountered a problem.  The default resolution for the notebook is 1024 x 768.  This is fine.  On this resolution, no problems, everything is crystal clear.  But when running ANY application, if the resolution is BELOW 1024 x 768 pixels, and it is in fullscreen, the display is horrid.  Blocky and grainy.  I am not quite sure why this problem occurs, and I have contacted Compaq, and they have no idea either.  It is very frustrating when playing a computer game.  This same thing happens also if you switch the desktop display to 800 x 600.  The effect is almost like this - when you decrease the resolution, the size of the window (of the application) decreases as well, and then just stretches out, which is NOT what decreasing resolution is supposed to do.  When I connected another desktop monitor to the notebook, everything was fine, but it has something to do with the 1024 x 768 flat panel monitor on the laptop.  This same thing happened with my first laptop, which was also by Compaq, so I assumed at first that this was a universal problem for laptops.  But recently, at Best Buy, I tried a demo laptop (HP) and the change in resolution worked perfectly, so now I am forced to believe that this is just a glitch in Compaq laptops.  To sum up my review, I advise anyone who is looking for a good notebook for purposes other than games to buy it.  Otherwise, gamers stear clear, this notebook isn't for you.  Get a Dell or something.
I just bought it and it worked pretty well for 5 days.  I was very happy until the 6th day when its screen went bad (dead backlight).  Compaq told me they will take 10 business days to repair it.  I am still contemplating keeping it and getting it repaired or returning it.  I really liked it other than this problem.
i am reading these reviews of people saying that they don't like this little kick ass machine, well i have had no problem with the dvd player, battery,cd player, burner and programing those little butons. this computer has alot of speed, power and of course windows Xp. the only thing that is wroing with this computer is when i first started it up i noticed one pixel was messed up in the top left hand cornor which is always red if it the backround is white, but that is not a MAJOR PROBLEM in fact i have gotten use to it, this computer has 2 usb ports, a printer port a parrell port two pci cards,. a 10/100 card, and an s-video plug in the back so you can hook it up to a tv or data projector (i now have a dvd player for my room). the touch pad is very easy to use and the keyboard takes time but is very easy to learn. the screen is awsome. the speed of burning cds is excellent, the dvd is beautiful. i don't know what that guy was talking about the sticker on the screen, just be patient it came off with one pull and no sickie stuff on screen. if i can recormend one thing is when you buy this computer from best buy, don't buy the warenty cause they used, used or re-built parts, and when we were checking out the man behined us had a cracked screen and i said "fix his screen and we will buy the warrenty" they said they cant fix it so we didn't buy it ( the warrenty that is.) now what another thing is they offer you for ... do that all the preloaded stuff take us 1gb of hard drive space, but with 20gb that isn't alot. lets see what else..hmmmm/. i bought a mouse to plug into so i don't have to the touch pad all the time. anything else i can think of. the speakers are excellent i download some songs off a cd and were playing them and man it sounded like a full size stereo. it comes with a year free of msn internet service which is pretty good ( i have a cable modem )if i think of anythig else i will post another comment
Great Notebook for price.  Its my first notebook and was not sure if I would like one, but for the price I took a chance.  I read the review about the DVD problems but after watching several DVD's with WinDVD (preinstalled) I have not seen the same problem.  I did have problems with software that came with the DVD movies, but it was a software issue not hardware.  This is my second Compaq with no problems.  I was a little wary of Windows XP but after using it for over a month I plan on upgrading my Desktop.  It's alot easier to add devices like PDA's, scanner, printer, et.  I've only had two draw backs so far, one is the battery life is only about 2 hrs and about 1.2 with DVD. The other is finding accessories for it (battery, memory, et), but since it's new I'm sure in a few months they will be all over the internet. If you are not a power user and need portability, this machine is an excellant choice.
This is a good computer worth the money paid for it.  I use it as a desktop replacement.  A few complaints though.  I called compaq to inquire about a docking station for the 705US and they said they have one.  I then bought the computer and was leary when there was no docking station hookup.  I called compaq to order the puppy only to find they don't exist.  So when using as a desktop replacement, you'll have to plug everything in separately.  (or buy a USB universal docker...the one I bought doesn't like the keyboard).  The additional free 256 MB of RAM offer seemed like a good deal but only to find out when the RAM arrived was that the 705US only has one slot for memory and it already had 256 MB.  So now I have a second unusuable 256MB or RAM (anybody want to buy it).  Also I selected the notebook starter kit instead of the $100 off...and you might guess, after following the instructions to the letter, two months later, I'm still waiting on my starter kit...and that's after doing it online and mailing in the paperwork (online reguistration was suppose to speed things up).  While I'm overall happy with the notebook, next time I'm not buying online because too many details are not available.  Merry Christmas.
If reliability and customer service are important to you look elsewhere.  After years of using Compaq equipment professionally, I've seen a marked decline in the quality and reliability of the Presario series Notebook line.  I have a 700Z Custom built that replaced my 1201Z 1 Ghz AMD notebook after Compaq attempted to repair it 5 times in 3 months.  The customer service is awful, and they can't seem to get it right.  Just this week I ordered a spare battery for the Mdl 700 and they sent the wrong battery.  I spent years reccomending Compaq equipment but in good conscience could never reccomend one again.  I too have had DVD playback difficulties and thats with it loaded with 384 Meg of RAM.
I bought this computer from Best Buy and am quite happy so far. I have viewed several DVD's (no problems), burned about 20 CD's, and play games constantly. This notebook is great. My only big complaint is the battery. It only lasts about 2 hours, unless I am using the DVD/CD-RW drive, then it is much shorter. The speakers are wonderful, never heard such great speakers on a laptop. I had to buy another mouse when I am at home, but the touchpad is much better than others I have used.
Things I really like about this notebook:
- Speed: 1 GHz. I use this notebook as my desktop replacement.
- Hard drive space: 20GB is huge for what I do.
- Little scroll button: quite helpful.
- Speakers: JBL Pro are absolutely the best.
- Combo DVD/CD-RW Drive: more convenient than swapping like Gateway.
Things I dislike:
- Little buttons at the top of the keyboard: Can't figure out how to change what they do.
- Windows XP: Takes a while getting used to compared to Windows 98.
- The stupid sticker that came on the screen: A bugger to get off, I still have a little stickiness on the screen.
- The stickers advertising AMD and Windows XP on the corner of the keyboard: I have scratched my arm several times.
That's about it. If you are going to be near an outlet most of the time, this is the laptop to get. Or if you don't mind spending $100 on a car adapter or another battery, still the best machine for your money.
This little laptop is a rare find at under 1000.00.  You get a good deal of power and it's quite light weighing in at only 6.39 lbs.  The price I paid was after 2 rebates, one from Compaq, the other from Circuit City.
Out of the box it was easy to setup with a simple to read/use setup poster that describes each of the ports front/back and what the buttons on the inside are for.
The keyboard is small and gets in the way at times, but fix that by adding a PS/2 keyboard and you're good to go.  The RAM is shared with the Video memory, so you only get 240 MB of RAM, I imagine when RAM is cheaper for this notebook, I'll upgrade to 384MB (Maximum for this model).
It comes with a 900 Mhz Duron (which some say is better than a Celeron any day) runs quite well, faster than my PIII 550 Desktop any way.  It comes with Windows XP and MS Works and some other poopy software, which I uninstalled so i could put what I wanted on it.
Consider this if you purchase this machine you get:
900 Mhz Duron with 256MB PC133 SDRAM, a 20GB Hard drive, an 8x DVD, a 14.1 XGA TFT Active Matrix, a 4X AGP with VIA ProSavage KN1334, JBL Pro Audio Speakers with Bass Reflex
Inputs/Outputs  S-Video TV-Out, Headphone/Speaker-Out, Microphone-In, 2 USB Ports, an Ethernet Port, an Integrated V.92 56 KBPS modem, a touchpad mouse, and Lithium-Ion battery that lasts 2.5 hours in good conditions (not playing DVD's or games).
This is my first laptop and first Compaq, too and I'm impressed!
Note: this thing is great if it is plugged in, but not as good on battery. It's still better than anyting with a mobile P3... Face it, Intel doesn't make 'em like they used to- AMD for speed and stability.
But this new one seems to be a lot nicer- I can play 3d games at a good rate (ok- the video card isn't good for 3d, but this processor rocks! And I have the 900Mhz, not the 1Ghz, also, with the games, it did good at 128MB memory, This modle that Amazon is selling can be upgraded to 128MB+256MB)
DVD playback is great.
Also, mine has been dropped several times and still works.
This product, being the next improvement to the 1200 series should out perform mine in almost every respect... except one. The case of this new modle is ugly. I like my black one better :-)
Only after I used this computer did I realize that this is the worst decision I've done-----
1. You have no option for OS except XP, which is the poorest OS I've used. Compaq doesn't provide driver and support for any other OS.
2. The manual is very poor and not helpful.
3. The refreshing of screen is really bad. It has 1 to 2 seconds delay to refresh the screen when you're paging up or down webpages.
I was suprised to find that people are having problems with this computer. I own one and love it. I can play Unreal Tournament at 1024x768 at a high frame rate, with NO problems. I also play a lot of sims, and have had no trouble. This is faster than my desktop computer, an Athlon 500, with 320mb RAM! The audio is great, the screen is clear and bright.
I for one have not had any problems with the DVD. (The movies I play are new releases from Blockbuster.) Due to copy-protection, Disney has had noted problems with its DVDs for quite a while. The biggest example is ANTS, which refused to play on many computers. I will bet that copy-protection schemes are messing up the video for the other reviewers. I have had no problems with skipping frames or the like. I do however remove the background programs from running while I play DVDs.
Overall, this is a great computer. Light (6.5lbs), great memory (20 gigs), good battery life (about 3 hours on max battery life setting), and good audio. I really like it.
I've got the same problem with dvd's on this unit- using it as a portable dvd player is one of the reasons i bought it, but something is very wrong- lots of frame and audio skip, and frequent screen freezes. Display units in the stores have the same problem. I've tried 3 dvd's and all three have had problems. 'Shrek', one of Amazon's top selling dvd's, is the most problematic when playing
Otherwise, this laptop is fabulous, you can't beat it for price and features this holiday season. But a lot of folks will be upset Christmas morning when they can't watch their favorite animated dvd's
I should mention that Compaq support has been very responsive to my calls for help, suggesting various configuration changes that have improved the playback, but it is still not 'dvd' quality...
Additional Comments 12/11/01 - the Interactual DVD player conflicts with some of the Compaq settings (see Interactual web site).  Do not load it on this laptop.  It is the one that tries to self load when many of the newer dvds are played on computers.  I recovered the computer and avoided the Interactual player.  It now works great with all dvd's I've tried, except for Shrek, which I think might require the Interactual player due to all of the additional content.  I am now really pleased with this laptop.
I wanted a laptop that was relatively compact, had a one gigahertz AMD processor, at least 256 megabytes of memory, and a DVD/CD-RW combination drive. This laptop had them all. I purhcased it a couple of weeks ago, and in terms of the laptop I was looking for, I couldn't be happier. Two peeves, though.
One is that I was duped into buying another computer that didn't have independent video memory (this computer's video memory, while a generous sixteen megabytes, is "shared" with--or taken away from, to be more precise--the computer's main memory, a problem I've encountered with my two previous desktop purchases), so while the computer is advertised to have 256 megabytes of memory, only 240 of them can be used for other applications. ("Only" 240--what am I saying? My previous computer had only 128!)
The other is that in order to type in special characters using the integrated numeric keypad, I must hit Fn + NumLk, then the keystrokes required, then Fn + NumLk once again to turn off the keypad in order to again be able to use that part of the keyboard normally. Other computers allow the user just to type Fn and the required keystrokes without all the NumLk business, but this one suited my needs best, so I chose to overlook the flaw. I am reminded of it, however, every time I type up a French composition and need those accents. Sacr bleu!
A more trivial annoyance is the row of Compaq "EasyAccess" buttons, which are not that easy to access at all (they are located in a narrow space between the keyboard and the screen--if you want a better of idea of how they look you can find a bunch of useful photographs at bestbuy.com), and the volume ones did not work (it had seemed) for the first week I used the computer. Finally I figured out that the EasyAccess volume buttons don't work like television volume buttons, the ones you can hold down--these ones can only be pressed once every second or so for them to respond. I usually opt to adjust the volume instead using the (excellent) Windows software. Also, the EasyAccess buttons (which include technical support, e-mail, Web search, and Windows Media Player buttons) all surround the computer's power button, so I generally don't use them for fear I might inadvertently shut off my computer.
Short battery life is another problem--mine runs out after only an hour and thirty minutes, not even enough to watch a full DVD movie. Not good for portability, but since I don't travel that much, I'm fine--for now (I think).
So aside from all that, the Compaq Presario 705US Notebook is a solidly built computer with a stable operating system, and both are a breeze to use. While I occasionally look at other notebooks with a tinge of envy, I keep reminding myself how little I paid in comparison to how much I got, and when I get home, I turn on my notebook, turn up its incredibly sonorous speakers (they really are good speakers) to full blast and get lost in the digital music library that, so far, the included Windows Media Player and I have managed to keep organized.
I just replaced a whole pile of older Apple gear (including a 500 MHz IceBook) with this model (the G4/667/DVD).  It was well worth it.  The iBook is a great Mac for the money, but the newest PowerBook G4 systems are just great Macs, period.  The speed is fast for virtually any task, and OS X 10.1 is snappy in a way that the G3-based systems can't touch.  The improved Radeon Mobility video (with double the VRAM of the older G4) improves display performance, and mirroring is snappy, without the lag that some mirrored displays have been known to show.  It fully supports the resolution of the Apple Cinema display (with an adapter, though - the Powerbook only has VGA out).  Performance on the latest builds of the OS X DVD player is excellent thus far, and it can use the full screen for a simulated 16:9 effect.  Built-in networking options include 10/100/1000 (!) Ethernet, an included V.90 modem, and an integrated AirPort card supporting 128-bit WEP (broken though WEP is).
Apple also addressed most of the design flaws from the original G4 series - the port cover in the back now has slits machined into it for better ventilation, the body flexes a little less, and disc alignment doesn't seem to be the problem it was in some earlier models.  AirPort range is improved, though still nowhere near as good as what you can get with the iBook series - the antennas are quite limited by the metal case (Faraday cage, anyone?).  The new power adapter is a big improvement over the previous "flying saucer" design, as well.  Chances are good that you'll never need to connect anything to the built-in Cardbus slot, but one is provided in case 1 6-pin Firewire port, 2 USB ports, VGA and S-Video out, and the integrated Ethernet, modem and wireless aren't enough for you.  Go figure.
What can I quibble about?  Well, I still hope they find a better way to integrate the AirPort antenna.  A DVD/CD-RW combo drive like the one in the iBook would be nice - but apparently none currently are available to fit the super-slim slot-loading format the G4 uses.  Heat distribution isn't bad, but the back right corner can occasionally get uncofortable under heavy use.  And finally, the keyboard is held in place by magnets as well as the little clips Apple uses - those magnets attach with adhesive to the keyboard bottom (and grab the metal in the inner case), and have a habit of the adhesive getting loose.  Easily fixed, but a little annoying.  Really nothing I'd take points away for.
All in all, this is by far the best laptop I've used or owned (and I've had a lot of them).  No, the G4 doesn't offer the sheer processing speed of the latest mobile Pentium and Athlon processors, but the combination of a spectacular screen, light weight, good battery life, and general engineering isn't matched by anything on the market I know of.  As an added bonus, the PowerBook G4 even runs Virtual PC very well if you really need Windows in your life.
This Powerbook is awesome and it is a huge jump over the previous 400/500 series Powerbooks.  First off, the new video card makes DVD's and games run very smooth, I've never once experienced a glitch.  Second, I do believe this runs a bit cooler too b/c of the minor vent changes.  Firewire runs at a better speed than the rev. 1 pb and not to mention the 33mhz bus boost and faster processor too.  I haven't had a crash with OSX and run exclusively on it including photoshop6/Illustrator 9.  AND the new poweradapter is awesome, you'll have to see it.  Last, the ditch of the second option for the Apple/Command Key is great, no more offensive hand gestures.  As with the previous build, it's got a titanium exterior, lightweight, long batterylife, yadda yadda yadda...
If you don't need the top of the line Powerbook, the 400mhz model has great speed (faster than Pentium III and 4s), a huge (for a notebook) 15" display, and it's light at about 5 lbs. Plus, the Titanium body and glowing Apple logo are cool. Get a Powerbook, get a Mac and don't look back.

Apple has updated its already sucessful potable line. This is the new revision for the Powerbook G4, or TiBook as the mac fans call it. Let's see what this baby got for us:
A very speed 550 mhz G4 processor, which let's you take advantage of MacOs X ( already preinstalled) the best Operative System in the world. Also, if you use graphic or video editing software like adobe Photoshop or Final Cut, this computer will allow you to work on the road as good and fast as you would work on a regular desktop.
128 Mb SRAM. To be perfectly honest it would be better if it would have been 256 mb of RAM on this model.
The Radeon Mobility chip its a nice upgrade on this model, with 16mb  video memory allows gamers to experience great and fluid graphics on 3D and also helps when watching DVD, which by the way is AMAZING in this computer because of the 15.2 inch Display.
In conclusion, this machine is as stunning in performance as it is in looks and now it has a FANTASTIC price which has made it more atractive than ever. This is a laptop for connoisseurs, don't worry if you are not you can always get a Dell or some other toy like that.
What a mistake that would have been!  First off this computer is absolutly beautiful and completely functional in its design.  I don't feel confined to a desk in the least.  My PowerBook fits comfortly in my lap, the keyboard is large and the keys have a solid springy resistantance.  The display is amazing!  It doesn't look like anything else I have seen out there.  Widesceen, clear, sharp and easy on the eyes.  I don't feel any eyestrain in the least.  OS X (10) is so fluid, beautiful, sparklely and truely easy to use.  iTunes and iMovie 2 do not disappoint.  Voice control that will make you want to name your computer Hal.  The new lower price and the free double RAM really makes this hard to pass up.  Did I mention the DVD player?  Apple has out done themselves with this machine.  I cannot recomend this notebook highly enough.
Don't buy this computer until they start shipping them with internal cd and/or DVD burners! yes, you can always add an external one to it, but why waste your money on something that will soon be intigrated with the computer?!  If you really need a laptop, buy the ibook instead.  It might be a tad slower but at least you can back up your data without having to buy anything axtra (except maybe a CD).
I own several PC's (ugh) and several Macs. This Titanium Book is the ultimate. If you are familiar with Apple's superior OS, and Industrial Designs, you are still in for a delight!
Even my diehard WinTel friends drool! They just hafto touch it, and use it, if they're lucky.
You want it, you deserve it. Don't feel guilty, it'll pay for itself!

Apple has updated its already sucessful potable line. This is the new revision for the Powerbook G4, or TiBook as the mac fans call it. Let's see what this baby got for us:
A very speed 550 mhz G4 processor, which let's you take advantage of MacOs X ( already preinstalled) the best Operative System in the world. Also, if you use graphic or video editing software like adobe Photoshop or Final Cut, this computer will allow you to work on the road as good and fast as you would work on a regular desktop.
128 Mb SRAM. To be perfectly honest it would be better if it would have been 256 mb of RAM on this model.
The Radeon Mobility chip its a nice upgrade on this model, with 16mb  video memory allows gamers to experience great and fluid graphics on 3D and also helps when watching DVD, which by the way is AMAZING in this computer because of the 15.2 inch Display.
In conclusion, this machine is as stunning in performance as it is in looks and now it has a FANTASTIC price which has made it more atractive than ever. This is a laptop for connoisseurs, don't worry if you are not you can always get a Dell or some other toy like that.
What a mistake that would have been!  First off this computer is absolutly beautiful and completely functional in its design.  I don't feel confined to a desk in the least.  My PowerBook fits comfortly in my lap, the keyboard is large and the keys have a solid springy resistantance.  The display is amazing!  It doesn't look like anything else I have seen out there.  Widesceen, clear, sharp and easy on the eyes.  I don't feel any eyestrain in the least.  OS X (10) is so fluid, beautiful, sparklely and truely easy to use.  iTunes and iMovie 2 do not disappoint.  Voice control that will make you want to name your computer Hal.  The new lower price and the free double RAM really makes this hard to pass up.  Did I mention the DVD player?  Apple has out done themselves with this machine.  I cannot recomend this notebook highly enough.
Don't buy this computer until they start shipping them with internal cd and/or DVD burners! yes, you can always add an external one to it, but why waste your money on something that will soon be intigrated with the computer?!  If you really need a laptop, buy the ibook instead.  It might be a tad slower but at least you can back up your data without having to buy anything axtra (except maybe a CD).
I own several PC's (ugh) and several Macs. This Titanium Book is the ultimate. If you are familiar with Apple's superior OS, and Industrial Designs, you are still in for a delight!
Even my diehard WinTel friends drool! They just hafto touch it, and use it, if they're lucky.
You want it, you deserve it. Don't feel guilty, it'll pay for itself!

This laptop does not really have it all but then its dell the best CPU company there is so add accessorys and transform your dell to dell complete.
My employer provided this machine.  I find it marginally acceptable, but I would not spend my own money on such a system.
Major misses:
1) It comes with the synaptics touchpad, which defaults to accepting taps as mouse clicks (it should default to the 'suppress taps')
2) Shutdown service takes too long, even for Windows 2000.
3) No option to order with Linux or without Windows, even though Dell previously touted this feature.
For everyday use, I still gravitate toward my iBook.  The Latitude has inadequate USB connectivity (only 1 port), and wastes precious back panel space on a PS/2 style
keyboard/mouse port and a 25-pin parallel port.
Once you plug in a mouse, you have NO USB connectors left for a digital camera or other peripherals.  This makes the latitude a niche machine for corporate environments with very specific requirements.
Dear Sir,
Kindly note that I faced two problems when I used this notebook:
1- Some Keys of the Key Board are hanging.
2- The Battery working fine and suddenly dead.
Please Help me to solve these problems
i may only be 14, but i have researched alot before i bought this machine.  It is super fast, AMAZING sound, OK graphics, and a long battery life! the screen is slightly sharp, but still great! The scroll pad is easy and convienent.  Ive had it for a month and still have not had a problem! I love it and i strongly recommend it to anyone! (p.s if you are an avid David Letterman watcher, i was the girl who played her nose on stupid human tricks!)
Well, where do I start? Not with my last 2 HP laptop disasters, or with my recently deceased Hitachi notebook. The Compaq is my last hope for a great notebook, and 2 weeks into it, I'm encouraged. To start with, it looks great. It's silver and sleek and svelte, at least compared to my HP (Omnibook 6000). All the Compaq's stuff is in the right place, with a 3.5" floppy drive & a PCMIA slot on one side, and the very acceptable DVD/CD-RW on the other. All the other connections (including 2 USB ports & a network interface port) are on the back, where they should be. In fact, when not connected to its home-based wires, the whole panel hides behind a plastic hinged door, a cheap but effective solution.
The processor is the very capable Athalon 1.4, every bit as good as the Intel PIII mobile. Graphics are okay (a bigger graphics memory would make this a better gaming machine) and the screen is unusually sharp. The 256K RAM needs to be doubled(there is controvery re: whether it will only take 384 or 512) and the 20 Meg hard drive is just adequate, but these are not major drawbacks. This is overall a wonderful machine by a company that looks like it's here to stay.
Never in my lifetime did I ever think I would own a Mac. I was smarter than that.  I made fun of people who used them. I don't need the simplified GUI, I'm not in the Educational field and rarely do graphic design, so why get one?!?
Well wouldn't you know it...as soon as I heard OS X was based on the BSD4.4 kernal, my ears perked up.  Throw in a CD Burner, Apache, and all the practical and useful details of the iBook (way to many to outline here) and I was salivating to get my hands on one of these.
I first was MCSE certified in the late 90's, switched to Cisco/Networking and am finishing up my CCNP, and am currently a net admin for a major website in Seattle...and yes, I now own a Mac.  My relationship with this powerful little computer is mind blowing.  I can download mp3's and burn them to disk all on the fly, watch movies in the background while using a terminal window to do network configs.  It has a cool little button on the rechargable batteries that lets you tell how full they are without having to turn on the laptop (think Energizer battery meters on AA where you can see if the AA battery is still good or not).  The display is beautiful for a 12 inch.  I can boot into the Bourne or Korn shell completely bypassing the GUI if need be.  And (AWESOME SIDE NOTE) if a GUI app gets stuck, i can "kill -9 pid" from a term window and get back to work (uh, no rebooting like W2K).
I have a Cisco Wireless LAN @ home & @ work, and the built in wireless (airport) card works seemlessly between the two. It even picked up signal @ Starbucks on their network.  I feel so Elite when I pull out my shiny white glowing ibook @ Starbucks and check my email and chat while eveyone else is stuck in analog mode reading the daily paper.  True connectivity and digital bliss in a solid little package.
I won't fully give up my W2K laptop (comfort in the familiar), but oddly enough for this apple convert, my time spent on my ibook far exceeds my Windows use...very strange to hear those words coming form my mouth. Now I have all the Linux gurus @ work wondering why they settle for a Dell laptop with Red Hat installed when they could be running a native Unix OS on a laptop that already recognizes the built-in hardware.  OS X is a gorgeous environment.
Mac's aren't just for teachers and kids anymore!  =)

Great deal between the ibook and the powerbook, great procesor speed, big hard drive and of course the DVD/CDR.
Excellent size and weigth.
I purchased this laptop this past weekend, great machine for the price, there is a ... rebate available from Toshiba.  A bit on the heavy side but it packs in a lot for the price.
I read a lot of reviews and I kept coming back to this model of toshiba.  A tech person at our school district recommended this brand to me over dell, hp.  I am very pleased with my new purchase!  The fan does get a little noisy at times, but I haven't  taken it to a classroom yet  to see if it matters. At home, I don't care.  I am very pleased with the speed too.  It is a bit heavy compared to some others out there but I don't mind.  The 15" screen is great! I highly recommend everybody to look at all the reviews you can find to get all of the information you need before you buy.  The amazon reviews were the best resource for me.
I was compelled to buy this machine by all the reviews saying that it had a long battery life. First off, it only is long if you let it sit there and do nothing! I got 2hrs, 15 minutes just running a DVD. I got 2.5 hrs. running normal programs. The only nice thing about this laptop is the colors. It matched the mouse! I cannot even find a backup battery except from Toshiba for ... Well beyond the current prices. I would not waste my money on this computer again.
ocupo esta computadora para hacer trabajos de programacion y diseos con grandes bases de datos la velocidad y la forma de manejar la memoria son exelentes, algunas veces la conecto a una red nt, a internet, a una pocket pc y no baja su rendimiento, pase tres meses buscando un computador de bajo precio con tecnologia de punta, y esto compre u no me arrepiento, la compare con la de la marca dell, compaq y ninguna supera a esta laptop.
I have a sony pcg-fx300p, I have had problems with this laptop since the first day I opened the box. You should also know that I have previously bought two (2) other computers from sony. Well my experience with Sony is that their products are only and nothing else but complete fluff. They brake, they malfunction, the support is terrible, yes they are nice on the telephone and will send you a box just like IBM, but their tech department will return the machine to you with no corrections but a mere reinstalation of the OS.
Anyone reading this, don't buy sonY, it stucks.
My laptop is under warantee, I have had the product repaired twice, of course I have't been able to obtain an exchange machine.
Please don't buy Sony if you cherish your time and money.
This is the one! I have been searching for such a small size notebook with a big computing power plus lower power consumption. This model just fitted right to my need.
I've been using it for a little over two weeks now. No problems yet. I saw some reviews from on the Circuitcity.com about the crash problem of this model. Fortunately, I did not experience the problem. So, it's up to your decision to purchase or not.
The LCD is very good. Bright and got a good viewing angle. Memory stick slot is just perfect for a file transfering between my Clie' PDA and this notebook. The Jog Dial control is a plus feature I can use to scroll down/up the menu. Very nice. Most of all, it's stylish; you don't have to worry that it will be out of the fad anytime soon.
You may have noticed Toshiba is selling two very different notebooks for the same price: the 1955-S803 and the 5205-S703.  So which is better?  The 1955 cost about the same as the 5205, has the same memory, same HDD, a bigger screen and faster CPU, so it must be the best choice right?  Well maybe not.
The 1955 has a nice big 16" LCD, but the *quality* of that screen is much lower than the 15" screen on the 5205.  Also the 1955 is using a P4 desktop CPU, whereas the 5205 uses a P4 mobile CPU.  The desktop CPU runs hotter and drains the battery faster.
So which is better?  Well it depends on what you want.  The 1955 is a great choice if you are going to plug into a wall socket and don't plan to use your notebook on your lap (the bottom gets hot).  It more like a desktop computer you can move around easily.  The 5205 is a better choice if you need more battery life or want a very high quality screen to reduce eyestrain, do CAD work, or to play the latest 3D games.
Personally I prefer the 5205 for the longer battery life and high quality screen.  The build quality is also a little better (both are good).
CPU:
1955 2.5 GHz P4 Desktop CPU
5205 2.0 GHz P4 Mobile CPU (cooler, battery last longer)
Screen:
1955 16" LCD 1280x1024 pixels (that pixel count is too low for a 16")
5205 15" LCD 1660x1200 pixels (provides a much sharper image)
Graphics chipset:
1955 NVIDIA GeForce4 440 Go (good enough for some 3d games, light CAD)
5205 NVIDIA GeForce4 460 Go (about 30% faster than the 440)
Weight:
1955 9.5lbs (getting a little heavy)
5205 7.5lbs (not bad)
Both offerings have serious competition ... so look around.
Wow.  Everything you could want and more.  While it's not svelte (how could it be with a 16 inch screen), it has absolutely everything you could need in a laptop, big power, huge disk, gorgeous screen, CDRW/DVD, lots of memory, big time video card, built in Wi-Fi (leaving the 2 PC card slots open), and even decent audio (I was pleasantly surprised at the sound quality, considering it's a laptop).  The fit and finish are top notch (typical Toshiba), and everything about this unit feels very high line.  The wireless detachable keyboard and mouse are just icing on the cake.  If you really want to chuck your desktop (or give it to the kids), this one is the move.  (And no, I don't work for Toshiba)
Initially I wanted to give this 4 stars because it performs up to specs but with the rebate, I think the price/value makes it a 5 star.
You can't beat this laptop in terms of price - for the price you won't get a better deal on the market.  It has everything you could ask for, yes maybe it could have more video RAM but it's adequate.  The only thing I wish it had was the intellipoint mouse which I prefer over the touchpad one.  But other than that fabulous laptop and a great price.
I have nothing against Toshiba, although they've certainly laid a few eggs in the laptop market (the last one being a line [5005-S507] that featured a desktop CPU [PIII] that ran way too hot for the confined space of a laptop and resulted in numerous maddening shutdowns).  Anyway, this one features a reasonably capable 1.8 GHz Celeron chip as its PCU. These chips are a kind of "Intel-Lite" with rather limited graphics rendering capabilities. Speaking of graphics, the video card matches the Celeron's limited abilities, offering only 16 megs of video RAM. While the machine plays DVDs (and this is a nice feature of laptops, one that can make long trips quite tolerable), it does so with  disappointing aplomb (though given its chip & video card setup, this is what one would expect). Also irksome, it has no USB 2.0 ports (though it does have 3 USB 1.0 ports); these are becoming a necessity for many new high-speed peripherals. My last issue with this computer is its weight: at 8 pounds, it's quite an armful if you're carrying it too far. You might expect that kind of weight in a more capable, desktop replacement machine, but not in this road-only unit. Finally, I would mention that the company handled the fiasco with the above-mentioned overheating laptops rather poorly: fixes under warranty were available, but no blame was admitted and of course once the warranties are up, those machines will likely become paperweights. However, Toshiba did discontinue the line, but little good that will do for those who bought the bad apples in the first place. Anyway, I think the bottom line here is that there are better deals on better machines to be had, and perhaps from better companies to boot.
I have always had Toshiba laptops, and like all the rest they are GREAT. What more could you want in a laptop 30gb harddrive, 256mb memory, dvd/cdrw 15" display. It plays movies great, however if you are buying a laptop for the sole purpose of watching DVD movies, look for a model with more video memory. Overall I am very satisfied and have recommended this laptop to several of my friends and co-workers.
A ++++++
This is an awesome laptop for a fair price.  It will handle most all jobs needed "on the road," and it has all the basic essentials (e.g., CD-R, 256 MBRAM, etc.).  Overall, an outstanding product!
This machine is awesome for its price! I bought it 2 weeks ago and Im very satisfied so far. Although the 1415-S173 features a Celeron, the lite chip from Intel, it has a full 256 KB of L2 cache so its performance nearly matches those of the far more expensive Pentium 4 chips (since until Northwood core arrived, P4s featured 256 KB L2 caches). Besides, the processor is a mobile battery-friendly chip.
The laptops hard drive is pretty fast and spacious; its DVD/CDRW unit works flawlessly and is among the less noisy units Ive ever seen. It burns CDs at a 24X speed! DVD or DIVX reproduction is as smooth as a silk (not to mention DIVX encoding, is fast!). Ok, it has only 16 MB of video memory but those are real MB, not shared ones, so their performance is a way better if compared to most laptop graphics within the price range. Also, the graphics chip, which is what really makes the difference, is a speedy GeForce 4 Go 420! (NOT an ATI M6-C). This machine shines in games (they look gorgeous in its huge and bright 15 screen), even in some newer ones like NFS 6 or Unreal Tournament 2003 (maybe it doesnt matches the standards of high end desktop graphics of course, but those titles were still perfectly playable).
My only complaint about this machine is its weight you should have strong shoulders if you want to carry it around. However, I still give it an A+
I was looking for an affordable laptop whith infrared port. When I found Toshiba Satellite 1415-S173 at Amazon.com it was described to have 3 usb ports,1 parallel port and 1 infrared port.
I made my mind up and ordered it inmediately. Now I've found that this model does not have an infrared port.
Although I'm satisfied with the quallity of all other features on this machine, this should be fixed.
An update of the listed technical details should be done frequently to avoid inconvenients. Specially for international shoppers.
I was looking for a decent laptop for under $1000 and this Toshiba model fit the bill perfectly.  I wanted a laptop with CD-RW and DVD drives, a minimum of 256MB RAM and 30GB hard drive space.  Obviously, I was not looking for a professional laptop that is super-thin and light.  I was looking for something that can be a decent replacement for a desktop without paying $2000 for the privelege.
This model has a very fast processor (it is Celeron, but if you are like most computer users, anything over 1 GHz is overkill!), pretty spacious hard drive and the ability to record CD's and watch DVD's.  If you are into games that require 256MB of video RAM, this is not the laptop for you, but I watch DVD's on this laptop (on just battery power) and it plays back flawlessly.
The laptop also comes with MS Works software, software for creating CD's, WinDVD and other goodies.  Overall, a steal for under $1000 (you can get it for under $1000 even though the list price is over $1100 right now).  It also has a huge 15" screen as opposed to the 14" screens that most low-end laptops have.
The main disadvantages of the laptop that I see are: (1) no serial port.  This can be taken care of by using up one of the 3 USB ports and a USB to serial conversion cable.  (2) The maximum resolution of the screen is 1024x768 (I am used to 1280x1024, so this is a bit of a pain in the neck).  (3) Only 2.5 hours of battery run time.  (4)  On the heavy side at almost 8 lb (including battery, not including charger, adapter etc.).
Let me start by saying that my sole experience with laptops have been with IBM. That being said I was looking for a replacement for my old IBM and one that would be capable of acting as both a desktop and mobile. I started as most do by comparing a number of models, Dell, Gateway, HP, Compaq etc.. The final decision came down to 2 main points extended warranty and price. The capabilities of the machine came last as most are quite adequate for general use in this price range.
First I will start off with price, I was able to buy the 1415 for $...with rebates. All other models reviewed with the same features would run 2-3 hundred dollars more. The second reason was the extended factory warranty offered by Toshiba ( a must have on any mobile device ) was far more comprehensive and less expensive then the competition. I like the fact that it is a factory warranty and not a 3rd party vendor.
Since buying the 1415 in early December it has performed quite well with no issues, acting as both my desktop and mobile device. On the one occasion I spoke with Toshiba to look for updates they were EXCELLENT!
As a desktop I have connected a 17 inch Samsung LCD monitor and wireless Logitech keyboard/mouse along with a USB hub making it a simple matter of connecting or removing 2 plugs.
All in all a great machine, my only complaint was( No Track Ball ); a left over issue from using and IBM but solved by carrying a optical mouse in my bag. If it were not for that I would have rated it a 5 star.
I brought the laptop about 1 month ago. It plays DVDs well. I thought it might not considering the small video memory. As many people have pointed out it gets heated up fast. But considering that the price is less than any other laptop giving these features I am more than happy.
What one gets for the price you can beat it.  Frankly, the speed is outstanding considering what the spec's. are.  Great machine, highly recommend it!
I deleted my original, 5-star review. I know this particular model is no longer available, but if my experience is any indication, you should think hard before buying a Toshiba laptop, especially a lower-end model. I had the Satellite 1415-S173 for three years -- during the first year I had it, it blew a hard drive (thankfully under warranty). I had it fixed and less than a week later, it blew another hard drive. This time it went back to Toshiba to be fixed. All was more or less well for the next two years, when a Windows problem shut the thing down completely. I took my data out of it and switched back to a Mac. I am sick of Windows' unreliability, susceptibility to viruses and other problems, and the masking-tape-and-chewing-gum nature of patching together Windows machines just in order to make them function. BUT -- more to the point, the computer had inherent problems, first and foremost being the cheap desktop processor Toshiba uses (or used) in their lower-end laptops. This machine got incredibly hot and I was told this is probably what killed my first 2 hard drives. If you have one of these machines, I highly recommend a cooling platform which is probably the only thing that kept my laptop running for an additional 2 years. It's a shame, because aside from being very heavy and having a weak battery charge (1.5 hours at best), this laptop was attractive and easy to use with a nice bright display. But ultimately -- not a good value -- at $1,200 I don't consider it a "cheap" machine by any means, and certainly not when compared to my (less expensive) iBook.
This model had the best configuration for its price at the time I researched laptops in early November. The only downside I have found so far is the short battery life (2 hours) and the tinny sounding speakers.  The touch pad is a bit erratic too but that could be just because I'm used to a mouse.  This is my first laptop and I am very happy with it.
This is a very good machine for users looking for a mobile desktop.  It has all the key features for a mobile desktop: powerful Intel CPU, DVD, CD-RW, 15" screen, plenty of RAM and HDD space.
The CPU was built by Intel to be used in desktops, not notebooks; that mean it uses more power and runs a little hotter. Toshiba has been using desktop CPU in their low cost machines because they cost less.  If (like many users) you tend to plug your notebook in and use it at a desk, then this is a pretty good deal.  If you are looking for a thin, light, long life notebook that will sit on your lap for long periods, then this isn't the machine for you (those machines are much higher up the price ladder).
The graphics on this notebook are okay, but they won't run newer 3D games very well.  They are great for moderate gaming, CAD work, or watching DVDs.  In all fairness there are very few notebooks in this price range that have 3D gaming quality graphics.  The HP  xt125 is an exception to this rule if you really want a gaming capable notebook (it has it's own tradeoffs like a 14" screen).  If you "want it all" you will have to spend a bit more money.
This is a low cost notebook so you don't quite get everything.  The quality of the components is good, but not first rate, the battery life isn't a long as more expensive offerings, and this isn't a notebook built for hardcore gamers.  But if you want a powerful computer you can carry around with a large screen, then you won't find many that compare in this price range.
I had to come back and correct my review of this laptop. After using it for 1 week it died. I exchanged it for a new one (same model) and that one had a bad power supply. I went back again and exchanged it again, and the replacement had a defective screen. All three were purchased new. I don't know if someone dropped a crate or something, but these laptops were cursed. I exchanged the last one for a comparable HP and have had no troubles since.. Buyer Beware!
If you want good desktop replacement, and you live in Alaska, then this laptop is for you. It has a big screen but gets VERY hot (thus Alaska) and poor overall design. NOT RECOMMENDED.
Pros:
>huge screen
>Very fast
Cons:
>battery life (1-1.5 hours)
>Desktop processor, not mobile P4: VERY hot and power consumption
>extremely noisy (intolerable)
>bad speakers
>A LOT of junk software, some of which had expired by the time I got the machine. Some wouldn't delete.
>huge ac adapter with short cable and gets VERY hot...
>no floppy drive
>VERY slow hard disk. At 3600RPM (or 4800RPM not sure) won't do video editing with video resolution above 320x240.
>BIOS does not support RAM and higher than 512MB
>Video card not-upgradeable
>FN keys software controlled can't change CPU or screen brightness or volume in Linux, UNIX or DOS.
>EXTREME overheating problem, had to use 2 C++ manuals to elevate the laptop and put 2 fans under it.
>No serial port
>4-pin IEEE-1394 provides no power
I needed a new laptop so I really splurged and got this one.  I haven't regretted it for one second.  It's a little bulky to accomodate the large screen size, but it really helps with eye strain and makes dvds look incredible.
I use a sony video camera and these two were made for each other.  I got a firewire cable and plugged it in and was really impressed with how great my videos turned out.  The firewire allows you to edit from the computer without ever touching the camera - start, stop, fast forward and reverse cue are all controlled from the keyboard and inside of Adobe Premiere (which is a great program which is included with the laptop).
I have been nothing but completely thrilled with this machine and would highly recommend it to anyone - especially if you do any video editing or home movies.
Sony Vaio GRV 550 is an excellent laptop with huge 16" display and 2.4 G processor, it is an ideal desktop replacement.
Awesome machine. It has a huge, clear, bright display, good resolution, a comfortable keyboard, decent sound output, a powerful processor, plenty of RAM and HD space, one of the best ethernet cards around. Definitely recommend it.
I have yet to try to install Linux on it. Seems like there's not much information about it's compatibility, and some devices are unlikely to work, like the modem and power management, but driver support for Sony is coming along nicely.
Weight and battery life are issues to consider: if you're looking for a laptop you can use comfortably on a long flight, forget it unless you buy a power port adapter - on mine, batteries last for around an hour and a half with normal use.
This thing is fast, its Gigantic, its Hot, its a desktop processor with a laptop fan, Its loudish, and its not super portable.
Why is this good? Because it acts like a desktop too. If you have it plugged in and want all of the performance, youll have it. If you want to bring it somewhere, and plug it in, youll have it. If you want to roam in the park, unfettered by worldly concerns, specifically wifi and plugs, you don't got it.
The software package is interesting, but weird, all sony all the time, but you can change that, from all that software left on your desktop.
If you have any question about the desktop replacement computer, see this machine, it defines the genre.
The key to this machine is understanding what it is. It is a compact footprint desktop with a built in UPS. If you think of it that way you will be very happy with it. If you're out to buy a kick butt gaming laptop so that you can frag your way from Los Angeles to New York, don't get this machine.
This machine has a lot going for it, very nice 3D performance, very nice ergonomics, clear bright screen, zippy P4 performance, and you can burn your own DVDs on it. All very nice. Ports are somewhat limited (3 USB + ethernet + firewire + parallel and VGA) but you get back your serial port of you buy the port replicator. For a limited time Sony is giving away WiFi cards if you send them a copy of your reciept and serial #.
Sony now offers this notebook with WinXP pro (the GRV680P) and you should get that as its the same price ... and XP Pro gives you some nice server like features. The not so nice part is that clearly this machine will be orphaned quickly. I say this because soon the only laptops worth buying will have WiFi built in, systems without it will become like laptops without Ethernet two years ago.
The software was somewhat thrown together as well. The built in CD-burning application (drag & drop CD) works, but if you try to use the "built in" XP software for dealing with writable CD's it doesn't work. Other issues arise when you try to use it as a portable machine.
First, the machine draws 100 watts. That means you can't really power it from an airplane power socket without blowing the circuit breaker. Second, the second battery (needed if you want to have long run time) requires that you remove the DVD drive. That means no games while you are "mobile." However, if you get a piece of code that "emulates" a CDROM drive using a disk image on the hard drive you can get by, and the generous hard drive makes that practical. It also weighs a ton with two batteries in it so if you're going to do this get the Sony VAIO back pack to carry the thing. Holding it over your shoulder will give you back pains.
There is a slot for a memory stick. That's great if you're into memory sticks but of little use to those who have cameras with CF slots or USB disk drives.
All that being said, if you are someone who has a small home office, or a desk that you use for both writing and email. Or you are a student who wants to be able to use their computer in the library or the dorm without all the cabling hassle. This is the machine for you. It is completely capable of running all of todays applications (from games, to spreadsheets, to databases) and it offers excellent data storage capacity and connectivity. Like many (most?) portables today it does not come with a floppy but it will read/write CDR's and CD-RWs, as well as DVDs (send a video this year a christmas rather than a letter!) and the fact that everything was designed to work together means no annoying driver/motherboard/OS compatability issues to deal with.
Power packed little PC - but bear in mind:
The bad:
 XP HOME edition (not Pro)
 Only 1 RAM slot.
 Battery life not real long.
The good:
DVD burner included.
 It's fast for a laptop.
 It's real fast. :)
"burning ur wrist after a while" is going a little far. It gets warm but isn't as bad as other brand that have the haust port blowing on your hand. All the Toshiba preinstalled softwar is pretty pointless but a great machean all around.
First, hot spots?  I think that the reviewer may have had a bad computer because I have had my 1135-s155 for a while and it has no hot spots on the upper surface.
The main pluses with this 2gb, 512mb, 40gb computer (other than those listed already) are that it comes with 3 (yes, three!) USB 2.0 ports when most low end computers still have 1.1 ports (the speed difference is AMAZING) and that it has 32mb of dedicated Video memory when all other companies are still using shared memory in their low end machines.  Truly a great buy for someone that needs a good solid performer.  BTW, exactly who in the corporate world uses all the features on those $3500+ machines?  Really?!?
This is part of a larger class of laptops running processors slower than 2.4 GHZ that are becoming the targets of deep discounts and rebates now that faster machines are on the move to market. ... This machine painlessly recognized both my home wired and wireless router connections, and I was online in 15 minutes after opening the box. For the price, you can't do better in terms of HDD size (40 GB!) and memory (512MB!!). Three issues: 1. The bundled CD-RW software is goofy and non-inutuitive. Although I was able to use it, I pitched it after two days of trying to figure out it's wacky interface and installed Nero.  2. This is neither ultra-thin or lightweight (6.2 lbs). Since most of my mobile needs take place in  car, this is not an issue for me; your mileage my vary if you are hauling your hardware through airports. 3. The heat thing other reviewers talked about: yes, you can feel the warmth on the right side of the touch pad. Frankly, I haven't found a single laptop mouse-equivalent that I like as much as an actual mouse (unless I'm completely veggged on the couch or on a plane, I don't use the touchpad much anyway). I would not consider the heat an issue: most laptops have a hotspot someplace. 4. Battery life is middle-of-the-road...but offers excellent power management tools to give you advance notice of battery loss.

Great performance at this price point...more so if additional rebates are available.

I've used laptops for many years, but this my first personal purchase of one. Toshiba laptops enjoy a good reputation;  based on my initial experience with this one, they should. Bottom line: I'd recommend this to my mom if she were in the market for one:-)
This is a wonderful little notebook and i would recommend it highly. especially to any of you who might also be considering a Dell (like i was). the reason i went with this one was because i was able to get it at [a local store] with 0% for 12 months (same price after rebate as here at Amazon). but dealing with the goofballs at [the local store] is no picnic and if you could get the Amazon Visa with no interest financing then i would go that route as Amazon is a much better company to deal with in my opinion.
now to the M15-S405:
it has a great 15" XGA (1024x768) screen. and it is definetly the way to go if you don't want to spend all your time squinting at a higher resolution display like Dell offers on their systems (go to the Dell community forums to hear the support and hardware horror stories too!)
the wi-fi capability is awesome! i currently have it running on a wireless network with my desktop and i am able to access my DSL, share files, and share the desktop's printer with ease from anywhere in the house. also, you can use wi-fi in places like Starbucks for an additional fee. check out T-Mobile's website for more info.
this computer also has great battery life, very good Nvidia graphics card and plenty of memory (512mb) and a nice 40gb hard drive (5400rpm). and at just under 7 pounds it is not to heavy to carry around.
for accessories i recommend a wireless router , optical notebook mouse, and of course a case of your choice. i got a Samsonite L35 that is slim and fits the notebook nice and snug.
if you are in the market for a great all-around notebook, you can't go wrong here.
I have a great Sony desktop system, but needed a machine that could travel with me. The Intel Centrino first attracted me because of the built-in WiFi capability, but I bought because of the extended battery life (>5 hours) and fast cache.
At almost 7 pounds, this is not the lightest laptop out there, but it is easy to carry. The 15" screen is nice (I'm used to a 17" screen at home) and the built-in DVD/CD-RW drive is handy for file management and watching movies. The TFT monitor is not as crisp as some, but the display is good for text, graphics and video.
I haven't used the wireless Internet access much, but it seems to work well. Overall, Internet access is fast and smooth with a broadband connection.
The keyboard is comfortable to use, and the touchpad works well. I don't care for the eraserhead-pointstick, but that's a personal preference. This one is probably better than most I've tried.
The Toshiba provides lots of flexibility for add-ons with the SlimSelect Bay, SD slot and a variety of ports and connectors.
There are cheaper laptops out there if you don't want the Intel Centrino technology. I figured that by the time you bought the wireless card and an extra battery, the prices got a lot closer. Add to that the fact that with this one you don't have to drag an extra battery around, and I was ready to buy.
This could be a good desktop replacement or a fantastic road warrior accessory.
I bought this notebook a month ago and I am supremely happy with it.
A run down:
CD/DVD drive is great and you will love watching movies on this machine (in some cases sound and image quality are better than most tv sets).
The centrino is the latest and best processor in the notebook market and this machine surpasses the pentium 4 m models in performance and efficiency.
I have not utilized the wireless network connection but will when I attend college in the fall. Anyway it is a great feature already built in to the system.
The graphics card is great but not stupendous. I ran medal of honor: allied assault at medium resolution and it ran well.
The screen will show 1024X768 resolution with bright colors,&  sharp text.
The speakers are adequate in quality, but I would strongly suggest using the headphone jack if you are in to high sound quality.
The 512 MB of ram is an awesome feature of this machine. I ran 10 programs at once all the while listening to a sound file and there was no stoppage in sound or delays.
The touchpad is great and easier to use than the other laptops I researched at best buy. It also contains the pointing device in the middle of the keyboard, if you are so inclined.
XP, in my opinion, is the fastest and easiest to use operating system from microsoft yet.
Battery life: I took this machine with me on a 2-day drive to DC and each day I was pleasantly surprised with the battery life. I was able to listen to about 5 1/2 hours of music through the laptop before needing to recharge.
I would highly recommend this to the power hungry user or the person looking for a reliable, performing, efficient notebook.
I am very happy with the Toshiba M15-405. I have a Mitsubishi 18" LCD monitor at home and the Toshiba looks just as good. Sharp lines and crisp colors.
I am finding the Wi-Fi capabilities to be satisfactory as well. Battery life according to the onboard indicator is over five hour fully charged, I have yet to run out of battery power. The keyboard is comfortable and the unit does not get hot, the left side does warm up but not to an uncomfortable degree.
The speakers are nice, loud in a quiet room, acceptable in a moderately noisy environment but I would still suggest headphones for this or any laptop to avoid annoying others. You can definitely hear the speakers in a conference room full of people.
I just have played with ze5375 for weeks. I think this is a good laptop in this price range. Its graphic performance is not satisfied to me however when I tried to change the background pictures it takes seconds to refresh. I don't know why and I don't think a P-4 2.4 system should act like that.
Another thing I don't like is some software you have to install by yourself my machine was missing burner software the software cd is included in the package though...
Basicly this laptop is fair on its price.
Awesome notebook if you stick with XP Home but HP Support will tell you they will not support XP Pro if you upgrade or fresh install. (But you can "Build To Order" straight from HP with Pro installed.) How odd that HP Support will tell you that they don't have the drivers.
  While I had XP Home for a couple of days the one thing I did notice is the Wireless network "Monitor" would not report a connection correctly. Using Linksys Wireless-G Router (801.11b mode) I had a pretty good connection (30' + 1 Wall + 1 Window) however, while surfing the internet the network monitor was saying no connection.
  I have since installed XP Pro and have not been unable to get the wireless to work.
  Actual battery time is a little over stated as usual.  I'm averaging just over 2hrs actual up time on my machine which isn't long enough for some DVD's.  Better get an extra battery or auto/air adapter for this one if you plan on using any CPU/Graphic intensive applications on a long flight.
  One more thing worth mentioning is it seems HP has gone to shipping there product without installing the "Pre-installed" software.  Upon first boot I was left at a completely fresh OS with nothing on it.  You have to dig for their application software to install the things you want (i.e. DVD software, Corel, Acrobat Reader.)  I personally like this method but they don't tell you clear enough in the instructions, like place this notice first in the "Quick Start" guide or something.
You won't only get what all windows based laptops have but a whole lot more of good stuff such as software and some fantastic applications that will blow your mind off. I can't live without my ibook . . . and I mean it.
This is my first PC experience.  I am Apple man, so I have come to expect  extremely reliable and well built machines.  This laptop seems to meet my expectations so far.  Solid feel and performance.
The only dislike I have is the battery life. It does not quite reach 2 hours of use.
For the price and feature ratio you can't go wrong with this laptop.
While it is hard to say that 1 machine is the best in every area of performance, I have to say the Sony comes very close.
Everyone always wants to save money and some feel that technology is changing so fast that whats the difference if you buy a new machine every 6 months.
Whats the difference ? Have you ever tried movign all your personal files over with a flash memory card ? what about those programs and games you installed and now cant find the original disks to install them on a new machine ?
Also, I can't speak for other people, but I become very used to my machine and hate to just dump it or lose it when it finally gives way to time and us.
With the Vaio's and the Compaq's, you get a longer life span then some of the budget brands out there. I am not talking about major brands, but those specials for a $$$ machine with an unknown name on it.
Its hard to see the future, but this Vaio seems to have everything most people will ever want on a machine, unless some new technology comes out that we don't know about yet. The DVD surprised us all I'm sure. I watch movies on every flight I take on my laptop.
Sony seems to give you the highest quality but then ask you for the highest price. Its up to you, but honestly with Sony, you get what you pay for, their machines are high quality and they last.
Best regards to All, MC -TheStickRules...
I am returning several PCG-FRV25 units today due to the very, very large power supply. The biggest laptop power supply I have ever seen.  I suggest looking at the power supply before purchasing this laptop.  It literally will not fit in our current briefcases that we used to carry our old VAIO laptops.  I bought a PCG-V505BX at the same time and the power supply is the smallest I have ever seen.
When my older Toshiba laptop escaped from my custody by being stolen from the locked cab of my Ford pick-up truck not too long ago, I mused awhile about my options for a replacement. But since my Homeowner's insurance policy subsidized the cost for another, I did a brief but intensive market search and finally settled on this superb and cost-effective choice offered by Sony, one that is quite compatible to my home computer system, which is also a Sony VAIO system. This laptop is small enough to be light and extremely portable and yet has a relatively large and quite bright screen with terrific color and resolution. It is a rugged and hefty package at nearly 8 pounds, and it delivers a lot of capability with features such as a 2.66 GHz Intel Pentium 4 processor, has 512 KB Level 2 cache, a 533 MHz system bus, 512 MB DDR SDRAM upgradeable memory, and a 64 MB ATI Radeon IGP 345M graphics chipset. With all this built-in capability, this laptop will more than adequately meet or exceed all of your needs.
Sony outfitted the laptop system with a 40 GB hard disk, and features an internal CD-RW/DVD drive for burning and listening to audio CDs, one that will backup important files and allow you to view a DVD movie.  One of the best features is its large 15-inch XGA TFT display, which is capable of 1024x768 resolution. It also has an internal V.90 modem for low-speed e-communications and an Ethernet interface to facilitate high-speed connectivity. It also serves your needs by providing both headphone and microphone ports as well as an 86-key keyboard that has an electro-static touch pad, and a built-in pair of stereo speakers with surround-sound imaging. It comes preloaded with an interesting and useful selection of resident software, including Microsoft Windows XP Home Edition, Microsoft Money 2003, Microsoft Works 7.0, as well as a number of audio, video and photo utilities. This is a terrific unit at a very reasonable, and one I have already had a lot of fun with in the several months I have owned it. Enjoy!
I just bought this laptop yesterday from Circuit city, and it is beautiful.
The only reason I'vnt given it 5 stars is because out of the 512Mb DDR Ram, 64Mb is used for the Video Card, which I wasn't expecting and haven't seen it clearly stated anywhere.  Otherwise it's a beautiful machine and for the price and the features, well worth it.  After all it's a Sony :-)
Same problems as everyone else only we've got two of these in our company. We both had to buy an external mouse as the trackpad is next to unusable, the cursor jumps when you're typing away, wireless card is unreliable. It looks nice but that's all it's got going for it.
I have had my V505 for about 6 months now.  I have persistent problems with the touch pad as so many have noted here.  But I also have problems with the space bar not registering a touch on the right end of the bar so words run on without spaces if you use your right thumb to type the space bar.
Another frequently occuring and annoying problem is the cursor randomly jumps to odd places in a document so I find myself typing in the middle of a sentence two lines above or some where else than where it should be.
Some days I hate this computer. I wish I had bought a IBM T40.
I bought this laptop as a replacement for a nearly 7lb. Dell laptop. I bought it because it was lightweight (a tad over 4lbs), small, and easily portable and it was inexpensive. For computationally intensive stuff, I use my desktop. I take this Sony with me when I give demos, and presentations, work during a flight, or when I  just want to get out of my office and sit somewhere nice and get some basic work done. After years of lugging big laptops around, this Sony is a joy to tote around!
It is more than adequate for what I use it for: basic office applications (the OpenOffice equivalents of Word, Excel, PowerPoint); I demo web applications using Xitami, PHP, Python, and MySQL;  I watch DVDs &  listen to MP3s, and sync w/ my iPod using the builtin FireWire. It works great! Unlike one reviewer, I've had absolutely no problem running Windows XP. I've had no  freezes or lockups. I've had no mechanical problems either.  I agree with the reviewer who said it would be nice to have an S-video out. I weighed the lack of one into my decision, but I thought that what this laptop offered outweighed the lack of s-video. One review I saw online mentioned that the keyboard was poor--very little key travel and the layout being poorly designed. I haven't had any problems with this but I would advise any interested buyers to test this out at a store first to see if they find the keyboard difficult to use. The other laptop I was considering was the Apple 12" powerbook.
The v505bx randomly closes or minimizes windows such as the web browser, Outlook, control panel window, etc. I'd be working on something and it would just close. No error messages or anything.  What ever I was working on, is just lost.
So, I took it back to Circuit City with no problems. They were out of stock on another one. So, I went to Best Buy and purchased one with the exact same problem. The problems started before I installed anything or connected to the internet.
Best Buy charged a 15% restocking fee which I am trying to fight. But, until Sony gets this worked out, I would stay away from this computer.

Let me start off by saying that this laptop is phenomenal. If you get a unit that functions out of the box, then you will be one happy customer, I guarantee it.
But be forewarned - if your unit does not function out of the box, you are in for a long ride. I bought this unit about a month ago, and from the moment I opened the box it was defective. (The laptop froze after 10 minutes on battery power.) I sent it in for repair twice. The first time it was not fixed. The second time it was returned fixed, but with the MSBlaster virus and porn on its memory stick. As you can imagine, I wasn't in the greatest of moods. At this point I am in negotations with Sony to get a new, better unit. So all is well that ends well I suppose.
Why do I rank this laptop 5 stars after this experience? Well, I can separate the superb characteristics of the laptop from the wretched characteristics of Sony's repair shop. Amazingly light, this laptop will never be a burden to you. If I wanted, I could hold it in the palm of my right hand while typing with my left and never feel the pain of a 7 lb deadweight in my hand. 4.3 lbs is definitely nice. And the power! 2 Ghz of Pentium muscle, 512 MB of RAM, all tucked into a svelte case with a 12" LCD monitor and built-in wireless. This laptop is perfect for the on-the-go business types, or students.
It is the perfect machine if you get a working one. But be prepared for a fight when you get a wormy apple.
Just purchased this (using it now) and it's simply a good machine. Keyboard feels right despite its small form factor. Performance is awesome and the integrated wireless card made connecting to my access point easy. Beware of a touchpad and pointer that continually wigs out.
I was more than a bit disappointed in my new Vaio FRV26, but not for the reasons stated by the other reviewer.
My biggest beef is the misrepresentation of the size of the hard drive.  It is supposed to be 40GB (give or take). I can understand a little leeway for the operating system, the preinstalled apps and a recovery partition (after all, this is my first non-Compaq computer ever).  But my C drive has 13GB (9GB available) and my D drive has 18GB (18GB available, although there is an empty "Images" folder on the drive).
Second of all, the combo CD-RW/DVD drive seems flimsy.  As much use as a peripheral like that would get, I would have thought it would have been made a bit more sturdy.  I don't abuse my equipment, but constant repetitive motion of the door popping slightly ajar, and me having to pull it out the rest of the way with my fingers, and then press the CD into the spindle is a recipe for disaster IMHO.
The sound from the onboard speakers is anemic at best, so unless I'm using headphones, I won't be able to enjoy my CDs or MP3s (and with that skimpy hard drive space I doubt I'll be collecting very many and storing them on the computer).
The packaging was sound, the laptop arrived safely with all parts intact, not a mark on it.  It fired up right away, and began charging its very expensive ($229 at sony.com; $130 give or take at ebay.com) battery.
I immediately went to Add/Remove programs and got rid of the hoggy Microsoft Works, Microsoft Money and a few other items of no use to me.
The placement of the arrow, Home, End and Delete keys was haphazard, and not in any pattern that I have ever seen or been used to.  The keyboard itself will take some getting used to.  (I upgraded from a -- don't laugh -- Compaq Armada 4160T, 166MHz.)  The keys are so far back; the "wrist rest" or space between the keyboard and the front of the laptop is so deep that it's difficult -- awkward -- to type for any length of time.
I am impressed with the power underneath the Vaio's hood, however.  It's got a nice fast chip.  It will run all my apps (Dreamweaver MX, Photoshop, Nero Burning ROM, Word 2K, Wordperfect 8, Topstyle Pro 3, Links 2001) with ease.
If you need to bring your work home, this is the notebook for you. But, if you're looking for a more whole experience including watching movies, playing games, and listening to music, etc..., then this Notebook is not for you.
I bought it a week ago from Fry's Electronics, but ended up returning it because it was a "barebone" system in that it has a blazing fast processor, bus speed, and memory; but that's about all it has!
Don't get me wrong. Sony Notebooks are excellent in quality. About 6 months ago, i bought the 505BX (12.1") display, and it was a great performer as well.
But the problem here is that this FRV26 has no Wireless Internet, which is becoming so important these days. Also, it has Shared Video Memory which takes from your 512 MB of memory, leaving you with 448 MB of main memory.
Also, it has no memory stick slot, no floppy drive, and WORST OF ALL, a horrible graphics set with only 1024 X 760 resolution which, although common, is more suitable for a child.
Basically, they stripped it of every bell and whistle to offer it for a cheap $1500. It's a good deal, again, if you need business performance, otherwise....Go for a Dell ([...]) or an IBM.
You'll have to wait a week or two for the dell or IBM, but it's worth it.
this laptop is great except for a few things-
Good:  The 512mb allows you to run many things at once.
  2.8ghz is really fast
  very bright screen..and clear
  and many more things
Bad:  no integrated wireless internet
  battery life is very low; not very portable
  kinda heavy
but there are definetly more good things than bad things about this laptop, and if it is mostly going to be used at home or around the house..its a very smart buy...but if your going to be mobile..going from place to place, the weight and the battery will keep you from doing what you want..
but overall..a very good laptop..and the price is amazing.
BEWARE of Sony VAIO Laptops, you can never upgrade them to newer operating systems that MicroSoft releases every year. If you try upgrading them, the laptops lose out on functionality and SONY recommends you buy a newer laptop!!! Here is what they had to say in one of their emails -
NOTE: SONY does not recommend or support an upgrade path to Microsoft's Windows XP Professional operating system for VAIO PCs originally shipped with the Windows 95/98/98SE or ME environment. Currently Windows XP Professional upgrades are only supported for systems pre-installed with Windows 2000 Professional or XP Home Editions. Both Microsoft and SONY do not support an upgrade from Windows 2000 Professional to Windows XP Home Edition.
I agree with the comment placed by Via Con Dios. This CD-RW/DVD drive on this PCG-FRV 26 laptop is absolutely flimsy.
May I ask if this CD-RW/DVD drive is supported by Sony? It is my impression that it isn't.
This computer is brand new and this CD-RW/DVD drive has already started acting up. 9 out of times it does NOT open. Just for info - my computer is not on standby or hibernate.
It is too much of a pain to send it back and forth to Sony. I'd rather get an external DVD drive and move on.
I'd strongly recommend to Amazon: Please do NOT sell any more of this version of Vaio.
I purchased a Sony GRX500 as a graduating present for my daughter. Initially, it was fine but started to fail after the warranty ran out (of course). This seems to be a manufacturing flaw, ...  There are hundreds of people complaining about the same symptoms (does not boot, fails). The real disappointment is Sony's reaction to this: we have never seen this before (a lie) and it will cost you $700.- for a new motherboard. I will not purchase any Sony products in the future in general and would recommend Dell for laptops - their service is good.
Never ever a buy a Sony Laptop. They provide you a a CD-RW for FREEEEEEEEEE!! The trick behind is that they don't need to provide you a recovery CD.
What all you get in the box is the trash AOL CD!!
They have a program that will create 10 coasters in order to recover the applications and OS!!
I will never ever rely on this!!
So, please stay away!! That is billion dollar advice I can give.
hello...
iam a analysis so i enteresting you product
 but my country is INDONESIA would you shipping
 to my adress.
I bought a Sony FRV26 about 3 months ago after reading various positive reviews.  Last month, there was a virus and my friend reinstalled windows for me.  The laptop came with Windows Home Edition, yet my friend installed a Windows XP.  After it was reinstalled, the CD ROM wouldn't read most of the CDs that it used to read, and all the function keys (i.e. for adjusting brightness and volumne, etc.) wouldn't work. I called Sony and was told that I needed to buy a recovery CD set.  It just happened that the SONY laptops have some special hidden functions installed in them, and the user ABSOLUTELY CANNOT reinstall windows or delete anything important on their own, or nothing, even the CD ROM, would work properly.  So I was told to spend another $21 to get the recovery CD, reinstall the old Windows Home Edition, and then upgrade it to XP by calling SONY again to ask for special instructions on how to do that.  I haven't bought the CD yet because I'm still considering.
This has never happened to any of the laptops I owned (I switch a laptop every 3-4 years, and so far I've tried Compaq, IBM, and DELL).  On top of this, the screen resolution is very strange (it has double images, when you switch from a page to another, the previous page's shadow stays on the screen), and the battery lasts for about an hour.  The CD ROM (even before I reinstalled Windows) wouldn't read any of the copied CDs, even the data CD that I burn using SONY laptop.  The CD ROM is located next to the powercord, so it's very difficult to open the CDROM without first removing the powercord.  Anyway, compared to the laptops I've used before, I'd have to say that it's sucks.  Had I known that it'd take so much trouble to reinstall windows, I'd never have bought this laptop.  And after trying it, I'll never ever ever buy another SONY laptop again (but I'd still buy SONY stereo systems and TVs because they are really good).
Everything else is ticking me off lately, this Vaio being the latest. It won't run my Nero software, or STOMP, or anything it seems that is not somehow Sony affiliated. And their software has givin me nothing but problems. The video editor that came with the bundled software tends to disappear right before my eyes, so I end up saving my work every 3 seconds. And I've burnt DVD's that are bad even though Vaio says they're fine. Sonic music software that comes with it will not burn .wav files to CD's unless you have imported them using their software. The list goes on. And I recommend avoiding their external DVD burner like the PLAGUE. And their DVD players (I have 2) won't play 5% of my DVD's for no reason (and of course they play on others).
I really would like to rank this computer as 5 star, at least 4,5 star, but I should mention my disapointment with Sony post sales customer service.
I bought this notebook from Amazon. Amazon.com was perfect (as always) and delivered my Vaio in San Antonio, TX. I really enjoyed the computer and also the bundled software. For me it was an excellent buy (I compare with similar Satellite and Compaq). At this moment my only regret is not buying the PCG-FRV37 - I blame it on my hurry. ( I think that 20G extra on HD specially in a notebook that is very powerfull - and this worths easily 150-200 dollars more). Regarding the computer itself, my only complaint is the HUGE  size of AC adapter (almost twice the size of a similar Satellite's). Of course, one reason for my choice of VAIO was Sony itself: I already own several Sony Digital Products and Memory Sticks - Sony Digital Camera (we have 4 Cybershots at home), Sony Camcorder, Sony Cli, Sony DVD player, Playstation2, Wega TV,but I am not sure on this point. I feel I must use this comment to make a strong remark on my evaluation on quality of Sonystyle.com and Sony Customer Service (please note my advice: if you buy something from Sony - probably you will need acessories and help, you cannot count on them). Sony answers things like: this is not available, we have no idea when - and if -will be available, we can't deliver and worst: we can't suggest what you can or should do, etc. Unacceptable. (the best thing she said was: OK, I understand your feelings... not very helpfull).
But, this time again, Amazon.com saved my life: I was able to buy the couple of acessories I really needed - from Amazon - in a next day delivery-basis. So, I strongly recommend: before buying, check all the items you may need on Amazon.com. Of course, unfortunately, there are some items you just realize when you get the computer and sometimes after some days of use. And that's when you need accessories and help, and Sony does not help at all.
My advice: don't trust Sony Style and Customer Service. I have text file I pasted - more than 30 min "on-line chat" with Sony. I can mail it to anybody who ask me so. It's a real piece of nonsense !!! I hope this review can help someone....
For the price listed here (and you can get even better rebates if you look) this Vaio is a fabulous steal. At the very least, you won't have "restore" problems etc as a reviewer called "Sam Michaels" mentioned. One wonders if Mr. Sam has heard of Windows XP and the restore feature within it. It has nothing to do with Sony. If you want even higher duty backup facility then get something more professional like Acronic TrueImage or Norton Ghost. (Seldom necessary unless you know what you want out of these.)
The hardware of Sony Vaios is still made entirely in Japan, unlike your average IBMs or Dells (which are made in China or Malaysia.) This means that Sony's hardware is top notch, at the very least you can bet it won't begin to crawl after a year of solid (ab)use.
The only reason I take off one star from this review is the missing track-point ball from this laptop, but some people like the touchpad for the mouse, and if you are one of these latter, this is a 5 out of 5 machine!
Don't listen to foolish naysayers. Vaio rocks, especially for the quoted price (< 1,200 USD as of this writing.)
When my older Toshiba laptop escaped from my custody by being stolen from the locked cab of my Ford pick-up truck not too long ago, I mused awhile about my options for a replacement. But since my Homeowner's insurance policy subsidized the cost for another, I did a brief but intensive market search and finally settled on this superb and cost-effective choice offered by Sony, one that is quite compatible to my home computer system, which is also a Sony VAIO system. This laptop is small enough to be light and extremely portable and yet has a relatively large and quite bright screen with terrific color and resolution. It is a rugged and hefty package at nearly 8 pounds, and it delivers a lot of capability with features such as a 2.68 GHz Intel Pentium 4 processor, a 533 MHz system bus, 512 MB DDR SDRAM upgradeable memory, and a 64 MB ATI Radeon IGP 345M graphics chipset. With all this built-in capability, this laptop will more than adequately meet or exceed all of your needs.
Sony outfitted the laptop system with a 40 GB EIDE hard disk, and features an internal CD-RW/DVD drive for burning and listening to audio CDs, one that will backup important files and allow you to view a DVD movie. One of the best features is its large 15-inch active-matrix display, which is capable of 1024x768 resolution. It also has an internal V.90 modem for low-speed e-communications and an Ethernet interface to facilitate high-speed connectivity. It also serves your needs by providing both headphone and microphone ports as well as an 86-key keyboard that has an electro-static touch pad, and a built-in pair of stereo speakers with surround-sound imaging. It comes preloaded with an interesting and useful selection of resident software, including Microsoft Windows XP Home Edition, Microsoft Money 2003, Microsoft Works 7.0, as well as a number of audio, video and photo utilities. This is a terrific unit at a very reasonable, and one I have already had a lot of fun with in the several months I have owned it. Enjoy!
This notebook is trash, not so much because of it's operation but because of the insulting way SONY treats you.
1. You will get no CDs whatsoever with the notebook, only AOL.
(no windows cd, no restore cd, no PowerDVD or Nero, nothing), some preinstalled softwares for the functions. Mostly spyware inclusive. No headset. Nothing.
2. SONY has a restore program installed that does not work and they know it, it trashed 9 CDs by quitting the image writing twice, after 5 and then 4 CDs. There is no update either for the software at the site, just their advice for you to purchase the CDs from SONY.
3. SONY's idea of update is an ambulance icon sitting in the tray. But their web update by directly connecting to SONY doesn't work either. SONY needs to go learn how to do this at IBM.
In short if you don't want to be insulted by what is NOT mentioned in the price details, buy either an IBM, Micron (BuyMyPC?) or DELL in that order. I have tried all 3 and SONY is not worth your money.

This machine has a great screen, very confortable keyboard, lots of memory and a fast processor.
It is kind of heavy so I would not recommed it to frequent travellers.
I have two concerns:
1. The fan is kind of noisy.
2. The battery charter gets quite hot, almost too hot to touch.
3. The speakers do not provide adequate sound.
4. The DVD software forces you to determine a Region for listening to a DVD. I have purchased many DVDs from Amazon (sold as Region 1), and I have also purchased some here in Peru. The software lets you change regions a few times (I thinks five times), and then it freezes at that regions.

The first problem could be solved by providing a cooling pad (off course courtesy of Sony).

Its been two years, and a few days ago I had problems with the hard disk, but fortunately gave me a warning about possible problems, recommending me to make a backup of my information and to replace the Disk. So I have replace it with a Hitachi 80Mb Hdisk.
I am also starting to have problems with the CD reader. Sometimes it reads the information, some other times it doesn't. I will probably buy a new CD Reader.

The Machine is still fast for regular MS Office applications (I am now running Office 2003 without any problems).

I am a consultant here in Peru, and the machine has worked quite well even at 4,300 meters above sea level (about 13,000 ft above sea level)..

The battery now gives me a little more than one hour.

Lets see If I give another review for the next christmas using the same Lap Top....
Let me start by saying that I do not own this laptop, but have 2 other Sony laptops, a GRX580 and an FXA-10, and both laptops are about 14 months old.  Both have 512M memory installed, and both have the same problem with one or both of the SODIMM slots.  They only read 256MB of memory.  I've inspected the SODIMMM connections to the mainboard and the solder joints are BROKEN!!!
There is a potential class-action lawsuit that will soon be started.  DO NOT BUY SONY!!!  They are ignoring our problem.  This is widespread.  Go to [...] and read about our woes.
DO NOT BUY SONY!!!

At over 8 pounds of carrying weight, this Vaio is not ideal as a traveling laptop.  Instead, it's designed to be a desktop replacement.  Witness the 2.8Ghz P4 processor (not the mobile version), which is screaming fast especially for gaming and video/audio editing, as well as 512MB of fast RAM and large screen.  BTW, the screen is beautiful and has terrific viewing angles.
This particular configuration is a good value; what you won't get is built-in DVD burner.  Otherwise Sony, in its usual way, throws in a lot of add-on software.  Performance seems pretty good, as the system is responsive at all times.  The internal fan does kick in a lot, to cool down the system.  In this regard, I highly recommend a cooling pad with built-in fans, such as the "Bytecc cooling pad" I'm currently using.  It plugs into the USB port and the fans keep the air flowing under the laptop.
A beautiful screen, admirably fast performance, and general good looks make this Vaio a good choice for anyone except those needing a constant traveling companion.
There I was sitting on my sister's porch. Staring at my feet hoping for some inspiration to hit me like a bolt of lightning and supply me with ideas. It was not to be. I sat there for a half an hour justing staring blank faced and numb. I got up and walked to the curb. I smoked a cigarette and watched the passing cars.
I finished my cigarette and tossed it into the empty street. I looked up at an open window where I noticed a laptop sitting alone on a desk. Shining off the screen was something resembling a home video.
It was a young woman sitting in front of a window holding a child and staring off into the clouds. The image struck me and I stood in awe for a moment, then I turned to returned to my position on the porch and began writing, all the while feeling the sun's warmth on my neck and the image stirring in my head.
Sony has always made quirky computers, not bad mind you but their products remind me of Saabs. Anyway, this one is certainly a powerhouse, with a bigger processor than most home systems today, coupled with a mediocre sized hard drive (especially when one considers this PC is designed to be a media center, with its very good graphics and CD & DVD player) and a very crisp display.
The drawbacks here are important:
1) The 2.8 P4 processor is not ideal for mobile use. It throws off a lot of heat and it uses batteries recklessly.
2) The addition of another battery is a pretty steep investment, and in true Sony style, it's proprietary, so make that check out to S O N Y.
3) The weight of this machine is a killer if you're traveling, especially through huge airports where your flight is almost guaranteed to land at the gate farthest from civilization.
4) The absence of an integrated wireless modem these days is unforgivable. Wireless is commonplace, especially for travelers & students (airports, hotels, convention centers, schools, libraries, etc.), and in the next few years it will be virtually ubiquitous.
Anyway, it's not a bad computer, but I think it firmly meets the needs of no particular market segment. I have no doubt that today's buyer can do better at Dell or Gateway, or, for the traveler on a budget, at Averatec.
This is an excellent laptop, It is well worth the money.
The Harmon/Kardon Speakers give a crisp clear sound with more bass than any other Laptop speaker i have ever heard before!
The 17" screen is great for playing games, and the GForce FX 5600 w/ 128 MB of ram is excellent on mine!!! The 2.66 Ghz is enough to run any application or game flawlessly. and the thing i like most is how good the touchpad works. Hp has also incorporated a media card reader which unfortunatly does not support the "compact Flash" type cards.
There are a couple of BAD things though that should be seriously considered before buying this laptop!!!
The desktop processor eats up the battery as fast as 1 hour and 45 minutes, of course there are things you can do to extend the life to around 2 hours and 20minutes like dimming the screen, turning off speakers/ WiFi, and using the Nvidia low power feature.
The two Vacumme cleaner fans  on the bottom are loud and can be blocked easily, but it does keep the laptop very cool.
But back to the good things, there are 4 USB 2.0 ports and a built-in Firewire port.
This laptop is not what you could consider "ultra portable" but it is usable on an airplane!!! all you need to so is buy an AMP, then you can easily get 300Watts of power from any 12 volt ciggerette lighter plug.
I do not regret buying this laptop at all.
Great features, lots of speed and room, big keyboard, 10-key pad and all the ports you would want!
Aside from the weight, this has been a wonderful and reliable laptop for my business.  I highly recommend this.
The large and wide sreen works great with presentations, makes viewing spreadsheets and databases easy!
Highly recommend it!
Sincerely,
Heather
Assistant For You!

The HP zd7010us is not for the "light of heart" PC user. First, it is big with the 17 ich screen and heavy (about 9 pounds) and unfort. with the high speed of this unit and the brillent display comes one big problem for portable use. The battery life. If you turn off most everything and are very carefull about the screen (use more contrast and less brightness) and do not access the hard drive to often, you can get maybe an hour of life and that is it. 45 mins is more the normal, so if you have a long plane flight, take a plane adapter or a extra battery or so. So thats the bad stuff.
This thing is amazing at its speed, you rarely will see the hourglass display come on. The screen is great, very bright and clear, much like a desktop hgh end LCD monitor and the 17 inch size is great as you can see a full two pages of info, great for looking at two web pages at once. The sound with the Harmon Kardon speaker system is fantastic, I play "Titanic" on it and it sounded like you were at the movies. The disk access is fast and quite and the Wireless works without a hitch. Also its neat that it comes with a bult in card reader for up to seven different kinds of memory cards so no adapters are ever needed for this one, The keyboard has a excellent feel to it and the keys are well spaced and its nice having a seperate keypad. I found thee mouse touch pad to work very well and smooth, unlike alot of touchpads this one does not skip around. It has a large surface area that doubles as a wrist rest on the unit and the 60 GB hard driveis plenty. I might want to upgrade the memory to 1 GB some day, but in everything I did, the standard memory worked just fine and that involved many very large JPG files from my 6.3 MP camera. Even thou this is a large notebook, it has such a neat modern style that it looks very thin and you do not realize just ow large it is until its on your lap. I hardly ever used my desktop system anymore as this unit is so darn fast and everything just works fine. I have never had to reboot the machine and cannot find a single software problem. I updated mine with Windows Office 2003 and OneNote and that makes a fantastic combination on the unit. Be prepared that if you use this PC in public, you will get alot of people looking over your schoulder and asking "what is that" some think its the 17" Mac, but everyone that looks at it loves it. With the large frame, is helps out in the CPU problem of getting to ot to have in your lap, this one only feels a little bit warm.
I cannot think of anything I would change on this unit (other then better battery life) but then with this speed CPU and screen size, I would not expect the worlds best battery life. I would say that HP has a very clear winner in this model !
I bought this system 2 days ago, and have had no problems at all like the other review here says. It seems to be the most stable system I have ever used. It is extremely powerful when it comes to graphics and games, and for the price, a CD-RW/DVD drive is reasomable. I would not reccomend it for a traveler, it is pretty hefty, but for a mostly home user that just wants to be able to move from room to room, it's perfect. With built-in 802.11g, there's no need for anything but the computer itself even when you do travel.  This is 3 months after i wrote that, and I must revise that rave review. The mouse's touchpad goes bad anywhere from 2 days to 3 months after you buy a laptop of this ZD series. I went through 2 myself, and ended up buying a Toshiba P25-S509, a notch up, and have had no problems with it yet.
First chief feature of HP z7010us is the extreme graphics it produces. With 64MB shared video memory in collaboration with Nvidia GeForce Graphics Card, you can play the toughest games easily such as "Need For Speed Hot Pursuit 2" or "Max Payne 2" or "Medal of Honor". All in 17" Fullscren. So for boys and girls who like playing heavy-duty games this computer is desirable.
Second main feature, as I see it, is the computers Physique. Even though it is a dense computer, the way it is constructed, makes it look sleek and slim. It really looks very smooth, and the silver & shiny color makes it look majestic. For people who give a heck to the shapes of laptop's this computer looks good.
As to speed of this computer, "Intel Pentium 4 2.66 Ghz" AND "512MB-RAM" will never fail fail you. Run one task and you will get lightning-fast performance. Run two tasks at a time, and still get a good performance. Of course we have A DVD-ROM and CD-RW for watching movies and burning CD's.
One thing that I didn't like about this computer is the time it takes to load fully. When I log in to Windows XP, it takes 1 minute for the computer to load completely. And the more programs you install the more time it will take to load. Previous computer I owned, much slower then this one, took at most 30 seconds to load fully.
One last feature of this computer is it's keyboard. The Hp zd7010us has a numeric keypad to the right of the normal keyboard, so it is easy to enter numbers. People who are interested in a 17" Widescreen laptop's must give this computer a try. You can always exchange!
For the price one would expect atleast a DVD+RW Burner. And the battery Life is bad, about 45 min max.
This computer rocks.  The screen is simply amazing.  The keypad is a great feature.  I have no complaints whatsoever.  Definitely recommended.
I loved this notebook ever since I got it - It was so light, I carry it around with one hand just to get my brother and sister jealous, I use it while lying down, etc. Dropping it is no big deal because it's so light - the bigger they are the harder they fall rings true here.

ISSUES: these might be huge for some people, and I don't know if they are across the board. I've heard of both these issues twice before in all the reviews I have read: MELT and FREEZE. Read on.

1. MELT - The laptop gets HOT. I mean hot. I was hungry one day, so I turned it upside down and fried an egg on it. Well I didn't do that, but it is hot enough to have to use it on a desk or something. Otherwise it would burn a hole through my pants, and everyone knows we are NOT in the 80's anymore. I think the issue is that the fan just doesn't work. I would love to get this fixed, but Gateway killed all their retail service centers - so I have to pay $45 to send my laptop in, on top of the $200 I paid for an extended warranty. Thanks Gateway.

2. FREEZE - When I first got it, I loved the keyboard volume controls - what innovation! But, when you have this feature, why not test it to see if it works? Freakin Gateway. Half arsed job!

Whenever you plug in your headphones, and use the "FN" + "+" or "-" keys to adjust volume, the computer freezes, and a reboot is in order. TEST YOUR PRODUCTS!!!

Besides these two issues (which might be major, but can be dealt with, i.e., I just use the volume control, and I leave the laptop on a desk) the computer is great! Just a heads up.
Gateway is without a doubt the best computer brand. I previously had a Gateway laptop that lasted me about seven years. Seven years seems to be unheard of for a computer! And believe me, I was NOT easy on my laptop. They make a good product and unlike many other brands they make it to last. I knew that I would be buying a Gateway when I decided to get a new computer. I am very happy with my purchase so far.

One of the best aspects of this laptop is how silent it is. Sometimes I forget if I turned it on or not! One of the aspects I was looking for in a new laptop was a DVD/CD-RW drive. I haven't used it to burn any CDs yet, but I have watched many DVDs on it. The color and focus of the DVD player is very sharp. I have come to prefer to watch movies on my laptop as opposed to my television!

I noticed another reviewer complaining about the low battery life. Well, I keep my laptop plugged in all the time so that's not a problem for me. But to that all I can say is: what do you expect? I get about 2 hours from my battery if it isn't plugged in. To me that is about standard for a laptop. If you expect to get six hours of battery life, you're dreaming. One very positive aspect about the battery is that it charges very fast. Leave it plugged in for fifteen minutes and you will replenish an hour's worth of battery.

This computer is perfect, in my opinion. If you don't buy this particular model, you should still buy a Gateway computer. Don't go for the cheap brand just because it's cheaper. You get what you pay for, and with Gateway you get the best.
I bought a Gateway 200E (200 ARC series) 2 days ago from another online store (I'm still posting it here, so that other potential buyers may find out about this before making a buying decision). The quality, features and speed are good. The reason I'm giving 1 star is because Gateway doesnt accept responsibility for their bugs, and doesn't want to fix them.
If I put the computer into standby and then wake it up, and use the volume control by pressing Fn + left or right arrow keys, the system crashes. It freezes completely. Even ctrl + alt + del doesn't work.
I called Gateway, and this is what they said:
"It's an already documented problem with this model.
Gateway doesn't have a solution for this problem, they only have two workarounds:
1. Don't use the Fn + key combo for volume control, use the volume control icon on the system tray with your mouse.
2. Don't use the Fn + key combo for a while after waking up from
stand by"
My reply to #1, I don't want to look for the icon and click it, I want a shortcut whenever I want to control the volume. That's what it is there for. Besides, I press ctrl + arrow to tab through my text documents. It's very easy to press Fn instead of ctrl, and this is more possible in this model especially since Fn is the outermost key on the left side, and ctrl is to the right side of it, unlike most other laptop keyboards where ctrl is the outermost key. I don't want my laptop to crash when I'm browsing through my text documents or writing code.
#2. I even tried doing this after an hour, and it still crashes.
I have the latest BIOS (v 42.01.02), and Gateway doesnt have a newer BIOS update of fix for this. I use Win XP Pro, by the way. This crash is reproducible every single time I do what I described above (use volume control after waking up from standby).
Gateway said they just won't fix it or replace this laptop. If I send it for service, they won't give me a time estimate of how long it will take to fix it. They are just trying to deter me from sending it for service I guess.
The tech who answered my second call was so rude and yelling on the phone telling me not to use the key combo, rather than focusing on how to fix it. He even said he won't let me talk to Level 2 tech people when I asked. I had to give him a piece of my mind before he would let me talk to Level 2.
The level 2 guy was even more ridiculous. He suggested that I use the screensaver instead of standby. Moron, he doesnt even know the difference between the use of a screensaver and a standby mode.
Perhaps, he thinks people who buy their laptops are starfishes who they can push around and deny service for their defective product.
How many of you have had this problem replicable with the Gateway 200 ARC series? Can you try this on your laptop and see if it happens?
Does anyone know a fix for it? I badly need it. If you have the same problem, or know how to fix it, please email me at sen@stanmed.net
If there are enough number of people with this problem, without
proper service being provided by Gateway, I think a class action
lawsuit would be feasible.
Thanks.
Sen.
This notebook is great for someone that travels.  After comparing many notebooks in it's class. Going to stores annd physcially playing with them I found this notebook to be most portable and have some of the more powerful features.  This is the lightest I found in the 14.1 in screen size notebook.  This notebook looks great and is powerful enough to satisfy most users.  I guess I can list all the problems that way buyers can pay attention to those things when purchasing this notebook.  The most noticeable draw back was the battery life.  It comes with a 3 cell battery which amounts to about a 2 hours max battery life.  I suggest buying the 6 cell battery which will double you battery life.  I did have some issues with the 802.11b card which signal faded alot.  I had them put in the 802.11g instead and it works great. The next problem I found was the notebook gets really hot after a while (1/2 hour).  But not to where it might burn you just a bit unconfortable.  Finally I the cd-rom drive to be a bit loud.  Aside from these minor issues which can be easyly fixed, I found this notebook to be a great buy.  After rebates and discounts I think this was the best bang for my buck.
I did a lot of research to find a light powerful notebook at a good value.  I travel a fair amount for work and the 200 really packs the horsepower into a sleek, lightweight form.
The system has plenty of speed and memory for even the intense worksheets I use.  The display is wonderful and being able to watch a DVD on the plane is nice.  I wasn't a fan of touchpads, but this one has a good feel to it, along with the keyboard.  Best of all, is the size.  The notebook measures only 12.42"x10.2"x. 94" and weighs in at less than 4 1/2 pounds with the battery. This machine is a pleasure to carry around.
There are only a couple minor drawbacks.  There isn't a floppy drive, so instead I use one of those USB flash drives to transfer files.  Also, the built-in speakers are weak.  Again this is not a big deal to me because I tend to use headphones or external speakers.  Finally, I recommend purchasing an extended life battery if you're looking at running off the battery for longer than the length of two movies.
I bought this model in September and have been extremely pleased with it except for one thing: the USB ports do not work. While my experience was (I'm assuming) an isolated case, the customer service reps were not helpful at all, each telling me something different. I waited 3 months for a replacement part, but never received it and therefore returned my computer. I have not heard of any other cases of USB malfunctions like this from Gateway and have never had any problems with my other Gateway computers. Under normal circumstanes, I highly recommend the 200x, but if you have any problems with it when you receive it RETURN IT ASAP.
I love my apple powerbook. It looks good, also very easy to carry around. OS X is excellent, if you get the microsoft office it's fully compatible with your office, exel, powerpoint files from your PC. This is my second macintosh and I have no plans on getting another PC ever again, I want nothing to do with Windows.
I believe if you are looking for a laptop you should look no further than the powerbook.  I have the 15 In. and love it.  I am always using it and barely ever get away from it.  I love the OS X operating system and setting up the computer was a breeze.  I would definitely recommend it to you.
i have been actively looking for a new computer for the past six months.  with so many variables, i found it hard to to fall in love with just one.  price was a huge concern but i knew i didn't want to settle for a product i wouldn't want to use in 6 months.  I knew OS X was a superior product compared to windows but i was apprehensive about compatibility problems.  Once the aluminum came out though, i had to have it.  it was more expensive than the titanium and the dell (d600), but after using mine for about twenty four hours now, i can honestly say you get what you pay for.  Its as fast as you could ever want, the wireless is awesome, the whole i-suite is so easy and pleasing to use, windows office works seemlessly, and its all grounded by the best OS available.  i have seemlessly set up the wireless using a netgear mr814v2 (they tried to convince me to spend an extra $100 for the airport ext base station but  i'll never get more than 10mps over the cable anyway), my hp psc 2210 was easy to install as well (i have yet to put it through its paces though).  as a student, my primary needs for the laptop were portability and word processing with wireless internet.  I kept telling myself: "bare essentials."  that pretty much went out the window (no pun intented) with this purchase but i have no regrets.  its awesome.  They should ship this product with a disclaimer though, in the past twenty four hours, i've left the house twice and both times i couldn't wait to get back and play with my toy.  buyers remorse? only for windows chumps.
a great laptop!  The graphics on this computer is great, and the sound is awesome!  The computer gets a little hot when its in use for a while, but overall its wonderful.
While Apple's 12" and 17" new PowerBooks were great, they tended to be for niche markets.  The 12" was aimed at journalists and others who needed a full-function laptop as small as possible.  The 17" seems to be used more in place of a desktop than as a laptop.  Now all the new technologies previously only available in the 17" model, such as built in AirPort Extreme, the back-lit keyboard which adjusts automatically, the high-speed system bus, and built in 800Mbps FireWire are available in the most convenient laptop size. I have been able to use the system in an advance release at my university and it is stunning.  It is fast, the SuperDrive is excellent, and the features are great.  Of course it ships with OS X and Apple's iSoftware, all of which are great.  I used to use a Windows based PC, but have really appreciated both the power and ease of use of OS X.  And now I can use two mouse buttons.  It is certainly a laptop well worth waiting for.
I am not going to bore you with all the tech details the 15.2" Powerbook with Superdrive comes with, but I do want to let you know that I usually buy a new computer every year. They have all been PC's, but I got sick and tired of crashes and that dreaded "end program now" prompting from Windows Xp. This would happen with any program that used alot of RAM such as photoshop etc. Using two heavy duty programs or multi-tasking was impossible with Xp. Now with this beautiful Mac, no crashes, rock stable performance. I can run multiple screened programs effortlessly on the fly. The panther OSX system is rock stable. The computer is beautiful looking, it comes with some of the best software I have ever seen in a laptop. Steve Jobs has made me a believer! I will never go back to owning just a PC. And the beauty of it all is that you can now share files with almost any Windows file format doing away with old compatibility problems. This computer is fast and does not stick. It is light, and looks very sleek. Nothing can beat that!
The technical details regarding this Mac are available for all to read, and there is no reason for me to repeat them. I will only note that this Mac continues my lengthy experience with poor Apple quality control. It came, as did many of this model, with white splotches marring the screen, and the track pad button was so stiff I couldn't consistently hold it down. Both of these probems existed out of the box and the Mac was sent to Apple for repair. Since 1997, all but two Apple hardware products I've purchased -- and there have been many -- have suffered from at least one substantial defect. One small additional note: the keyboard is rather slick; fingers tend to slip while typing. The unpainted keys of my iBook have a better feel.
Yeah, I know it's a little more money than the knock-off PC clones from Dell and Gateway, but this is a far superior computer. The Mac platform is not only the most powerful one available, it is also the simplest and most versatile - once you learn it.
The 15-inch is the perfect size for me. I looked at both the 12 and 17-inch models and felt they were a little too small/big respectively. There is something attractive about the 12 inch - a friend of mine has one and he carries it around everywhere, able to write anywhere anytime. And seated at a desk the 17-inch is also attractive, presenting a massive, bright screen to work on. But all in all, the 15-inch provides the best both worlds. It's very portable - maybe not as easy to tug along as the 12-inch, but certainly manageable with a small backpack. The 17-inch can be problematic on a plane if there are people crowding you, and it's certainly cumbersome to maneuver in tight spaces, whereas the 12-inch is easy to maneuver but can cause a little eyestrain from a distance.
I definitely recommend a Mac, first of all, and within that I recommend the 15-inch G4 notebook. If you must have a 12-inch, you might take a look at the 12-inch iBook, which is cheaper but obviously not as feature rich (the iBook's graphics card is not as powerful and the processor is slower, most notably).
The complaints I have are exterior - the computer doesn't age well (i.e., it nicks and scratches rather easily) and there should be some sort of elevation device to raise the back end while typing (like the older Powerbooks had).
All in all you can't go wrong with any Apple laptop you choose. They are truly making the digital life a reality with all of their integrated software - iTunes, iPhoto, iSight, and the iPod are particularly cool. No other laptop will have an operating system with so many fantastic programs that are so perfectly integrated together. If this is remotely in your price range, go for it. It can literally change the way you operate on a day-to-day basis.
About a year ago, when researching the market for a computer system for my photography business, 9 out of 10 photography / graphics professionals highly recommended that I buy a Mac for my business.  So I did.  What a BIG mistake!  I bought a G4 PowerBook, and since taking it out of the box, I have had nothing but problems.  I am on my third disc drive, have a severe overheating problem (PowerBooks have a history of this, including melting keyboards), continuously have to deal with software issues, and now have a screen defect.  And to make matters worse, Apple's customer service is, by far, the most appalling of its kind.(...)
I have owned 2 Dell PC's in the past 8 years and have made the almost seamless switch to one of the best computers I have worked on, the Mac Powerbook.  I have experienced 0 problems and have also purchased the Apple Care with my computer as insurance which is the same as what Dell does as well, offer an extended warranty.  So to combat what the person said above, first you should always take the extended warranty no matter how much it costs, it technology and it can malfunction.  And secondly I had my last Dell computer crash and and lost everything I did not back up.  I was able to get help from Dell but I waited on the phone for hours and every person that I talked to had a very hard time speaking English well.  The communication was horrible.  Point of this message, the Apple is far superior!
There is no compelling reason to ever own a desktop machine with the likes of the fabulous Apple Powerbook.  This is a fantastic, futuristic machine that will never be obsolete.  Packed with the latest technologies, the PB flies through even demanding tasks such as video editing with grace, speed and stability.  With the Unix-based OSX operating system and the excellent iLife application suite you will never go back to the colorless Windows world.
There is no better machine out there than the Powerbook line; I've owned 30 computers and this one is far, far superior to anything else out there.
It's that good.  Nurture your right-brain creativity; the PB is the perfect tool to take your hard-earned skills to another level.  Whew...
It's been 3 years since I joined Apple's bandwagon, courtesy of 2nd generation top-of-the-line PowerBook G4. Back then, it represented state-of-the-art with 1" thick titanium-finished chassis and 15.2" widescreen LCD, filled with many desktop-like features: 667 MHz G4 processor (up from 500 MHz of 1st generation PowerBook G4), gigabit ethernet (up from fast ethernet), built-in AirPort (was optional), and DVD/CD-RW combo drive (was DVD-ROM or CD-RW only).
Two more generations of PowerBooks later (3rd added 1280 by 854 LCD, DVI output, faster graphics, and 800 MHz G4; 4th added 1 GHz G4, faster graphics, and SuperDrive), we get more substantial upgrade. No, this 5th generation PowerBook does not have a G5 processor. Mobile G5 probably isn't due for another year or so (Apple and IBM are busy at work cranking out PowerPC 980).
The most radical upgrade has to be aluminum alloy chassis. While not as hip as titanium, aluminum alloy is about as strong as titanium, while looking beautiful and providing one important benefit: nothing's painted over it. Pure aluminum alloy finish. Titanium PowerBooks were notorious for paint chipping off. Now the PowerBooks will stay beautiful year after year. As an added benefit, every keys on the keyboard are painted in aluminum alloy to give more complete metallic look and feel.
Other notable improvements include:
- 1.25 GHz G4 processor (10-25% faster than 1 GHz predecessor)
- AirPort Extreme (802.11g) and Bluetooth
- USB 2.0 and FireWire 800
- Faster 167 MHz FSB with DDR RAM support
- Up to 2 GB of DDR RAM
- ATI Mobility Radeon 9600 graphics card
- Backlit keyboard
- 3 speakers
Last generations of PowerMac G4s lacked many bleeding edge technologies (e.g., PCI Express, Serial ATA). And it being a generation or two before PowerBook G5 arrives, lacks some cutting edge technologies as well: high resolution 15.4" LCD, 7200 RPM hard disk, PCI Express card, faster FSB, digital audio I/O, and higher capacity battery with advanced power saving technologies.
Until then, you should proudly carry 5th generation PowerBook G4, knowing it is among the most powerful and certainly MOST beautiful notebook on the market.
Pros:
- Feels very fast (helped by 1.25 GHz G4 processor with large 512 KB L2 cache, DDR RAM, and ATI Mobility Radeon 9600)
- Very well equipped -- no additional hardware purchase required (although some will want more memory and/or extra battery)
- Simply beautiful... the most beautiful PowerBook yet
- Fantastic connectivity options
- Light and slim for a desktop replacement notebook
Cons:
- Among the most expensive notebooks in its class
- While it feels fast, it is slower than many Centrino notebooks
- 15.2" LCD is limited to 1280 by 854 resolution, which is among the lowest in its price range
- It is slightly larger and heavier than previous Titanium PowerBooks
- Shorter battery life than earlier PowerBook and many Centrino notebooks
- Earlier builds are plagued with white spots on the LCD and lid not closing evenly (both issues should be fixed by now)
- No docking station option
When you are buying a Picasso, you can't expect to pay discount. The Powerbook G4 is a premium computer, and you pay a premium price. What you get puts competing PC-based products to shame, except, alas, on price.
The biggest advantage of the PBG4 -- besides, of course, the operating system -- is design efficiency and elegance. Despite having a 15.2-inch screen and a fast processor (one optimized for intensive video applications and presentations), the PBG4 weighs just 5.6 pounds and is stunningly slim at 1-inch thick. Check your average ad for similarly equipped laptops and they simply can not compare.
Take Sony's VAIO GRX for example. It boasts a "gigantic 16.1-inch screen." Okay, great. I'd love a 16-inch screen too. But then, in the fine print, is this laughable phrase: "Just 8.4 lbs. and 1.8" thin."
Let's see, sounds like a great tradeoff, doesn't it? You get about 12 percent more screen real estate, 55.5 percent more weight and 80 percent more bulk (and faster battery drain to boot).
The Sony is about 20 percent cheaper, mind you, but I already told you about that part, right?
Let's compare Apples to apples, then, shall we? A new VAIO model with a 15-inch display and Combo drive sells for about a grand less than Apple's deluxe Powerbook, and a few hundred below the bottom-of-the line. You would think with a smaller display, maybe they could take out some of that bulk? Naw. This one is "Just 8.6 lbs. and 1.8" thin."
I don't know about you, but if the Sonys bulk up any more, their owners will be able to throw out their old "Body By Jake" video tapes.
Now, there are a number of competitors using Intel Centrino chips now that are finally becoming competitive with the Powerbooks -- you can now get wider, higher resolution screens (a great 15.4-inch model on the Compaq x1000 series) that are less ugly and heavy than before. Battery life is comparable to the Powerbooks, for once. You can now find DVD burners, though not slot-loading models. But the PC 'books all come down to being utilitarian, plastic hunks of hardware, mostly thrown together with only an eye on maximum features for minimum price. Apple's are the product of a harmonious mix of design and integration that lead to a pleasing whole. It's the only company I know of that creates 5.6 pound pieces of aluminum art that will literally have you cracking a 1,000 watt smile when you open it up for the first time...And isn't that worth a few hundred bucks? A thousand? How much did you pay for the painting above your sofa?
Taking this computer with you also gets you noticed. Jealousy abounds. You are instantly associated with the "cool" people. Add an iPod and you would fit right in to any hip hangout and become a magnet for like-minded folks who appreciate that there is more to life than just megahertz. Folks who understand feng shui and design and a better way of life will be attracted to you. Trolls will be repelled. Another bonus.
By the way, you might also consider buying Apple's 3-year protection plan. Sure, it's expensive, but if you bought that Picasso, would you take it with you on an airplane (not to mention through overzealous security guards) without insurance?
First of all, I'll begin by saying I've been a long time PC user for years.  I've always admired the Macs, but they never had the right OS.  The 10.2 version of OS X definitely changed that for me.
You see, I use PCs because frankly, they were cheaper and had more software compatibility, but they have security issues and stability issues.  I like the UNIX systems (Linux and Solaris) for their robustness, but frankly, I never could get into XWindows.
Now, w/ Mac OS X, I have a great UI and a UNIX shell for power use -- sounds like Nirvana!
So I finally caved in and picked up a Powerbook 15.  The 12" is a little too small, and the 17" is too large to be portable.  I took the wraps off the 15" Powerbook and set it next to my Dell Inspiron.  Never has my Dell looked so ugly than when next to this aluminum beauty.
I powered up the Powerbook and quickly figured out my way around.  My only gripe was that the Terminal application was buried two levels deep in the menu, but that was quickly fixed by pinning it to the dock.  All my favorite UNIX tools were there: perl, awk, gcc, and vi.  What do you know SSH is there out of the box.
Within minutes, I had downloaded eclipse, set up an SSH tunnel to my office and was working on the same Java application that I had been working on my Dell.  The only difference is I didn't have to download 15 applications to get it all working.  Beauty!
One downside -- the laptop is so beautiful that I'm being extraordinarily (picky) about how I put it away.  I kept some of the packaging and continue to use it.  I put the foam sheet between the keyboard and the screen when I close the powerbook and I cover it w/ the foam cover to prevent it from getting scratched when I stow it away into my bag.  :)
This machine is a replacement for your desktop.  It's that powerful and versatile, and if you're a windows user, the design of the OS X operating system that it runs will enhance your experience and workflow in ways you can't even imagine.  The aluminum frame beats the old titanium design easily.  Solid, resistant to scratches, better heat dissipation.  Close the lid, then slam it around, drop it, prop it against the wall and kick it over.  You'll break your foot before you break the laptop.  The display is large enough, and the text rendering is sharp enough, that you'll forget entirely about workspace issues.
  A piece of advice: Get the new logitech optical USB mouse with the little app-switcher button on it, and assign that extra button to the Expose feature of OS X 10.3.  Use it whenever you're working at a tabletop or desk.  Freaking brilliant.  This machine will change your whole idea of what a laptop should be.
This laptop is just great.  It is light and portable.  After having suffered with having two laptops (non-Sony) damage themselves because of a cost cutting strategy of using the screen itself as a support member, I have switched to Sony.  They have a case that is stiff enough to actually protect the computer.  A 12.1" screen is the perfect size for most things (especially if you are are trying to use it on a plane and you find yourself in coach, you just can't open a 17" screen unless you are Mini-Me).  This machine is great for everything you might need from a notebook and want to use it outside of the home.
Great job from Sony!
This new laptop replaces a Toshiba A15-S127 that we bought 3 months ago and one that died 4 weeks later when the LCD screen cracked. This one still confuses my wife and me given that the thing spent most of its time in its carry case and it bore absolutely no external damage on the laptop's shell. To add insult to injury the store we bought it from wanted to charge us literally 2/3rds the cost of the thing to repair it, manufacturer's warranty be dammed, I guess. Suffice it to say that we won't be buying Toshiba products again nor shopping at this store (who's name, by the way, rhymes with Stomp Youse Say), ever again. I would have reviewed the S127, but what's the point? We hardly had it long enough to get to know it.
When Sony began producing computers, I was less than impressed. Yet another big name producing very shiny products that look great while using second rate parts that deliver underwhelming performance. That was several years ago and while I still don't care for big name brand PCs, they are still good machines. Even though I build my PCs from parts I choose, I can't build a lap top, and after the Toshiba debacle, anything would have been an improvement. Truth to tell, I didn't really like the Toshiba from the start, but my wife wanted something cheap to take to work and use it to learn Spanish, practice her mathematics and watch the occasional movie, and the Toshiba did a fair job at all of those things. The Sony PCG-505DX is a vast improvement in every category, though it was twice the price.
The 505 features a 1.5 Ghz Pentium 4 Centrino processor- possibly the most important consideration when buying a laptop these days. The CPU scales its speed and processing ability to conserve power and extend the usability of the lap top. With the full charge the 505 will run for nearly 5 hours when doing things like word processing. Obviously, the more things you do, the shorter the battery life will be. The Vaio also sports a whopping 512 mb of RAM, an ATI Mobility Radeon 9200 with 16 mb of its own RAM, (a lot of laptops video RAM is actually shared with system RAM and performance takes a real hit), a 400 Mhz FSB, an 11 mb IEEE 802.11b `Wi-fi' wireless network adapter, 1 PC-MCIA slot, 2 USB + 1 IEEE 1394 FireWire ports, CD-RW & DVD player combo drive, Network and modem ports, VGA port, and a Sony memory stick slot. All of this is packed into a very small and very attractive box,. The casing also has a lot of polished aluminum, which will no doubt enhance the durability and life of the computer.
Though the S127 was fully 600 Mhz faster, the 505 out performs it every category- it boots faster, loads programs faster, and came with much better software pre-installed. I actually plan to keep all of Sony's own music and video programs, which is odd as I usually spend the first day or so with any laptop I have owned blowing out all the junk and promotional software that comes with them. About the only things I removed was AOL and that really terrible office package known as Microsoft Works. Everything else will stay. Sony also wisely partitioned the 60 Gb hard drive to make mirroring the drive much easier. (What they didn't include was a system restore CD or DVD and instead require you to make your own. If you want to do this, make sure your have a stack of CD-Rs handy, because it will take 9 of them).
The 505 is actually pretty much the same size as my old 486 Compaq Aero, which itself was a dynamite little machine. I love the Vaio's design and feel- it's sturdy, incredibly well made and given the luck we have had with our other Sony products, I suspect this little beauty will be around for a long time. About the only real complaints I have about it is the speakers sound terrible, but then again, this is a laptop and a general gripe about laptop keyboards in general- I just can't get comfortable with any of them. This is the best laptop I have ever owned in both performance and build quality. The screen image quality is great, the keys and controls intuitive, I only wish we had bought this first instead of the Toshiba.
First off, people on here who criticise this for low battery life are just silly.  This is a desktop replacement, not meant for use in a car or on an airplane.  If you saw it that would be obvious.  I use it in the house, and only move it from room to room.  Now to what matters, how do I feel about this after a month of usage.  It rocks!  I am a power user, very discerning.  This is the most beautiful, fun to use PC i have ever owned.  And I've even owned an Apple PowerBook G4 in the past.  This is much more capable given the larger PC universe and range of software out there.  It's fast, it's beautiful and it's making all my friends envious.  Everything works perfectly, and the screen is truly beautiful!  My only complainst is that at this price, bluetooth should come as standard.  I use the networking 802.11g at home and it was simple to use and picks up the signal no trouble.  I've used it for games, and inless you are at the bleeding edge of gaming you will find the nVidea graphics card amazing, can deal with all the current games out there, no matter now 3D intensive they are.  Note:  Call of Duty doesn't support widescreen, so it only occupies the left hand portion of the screen.  Movies look great on here and software has lots of room to work with.
If you want a PC that is fast and sexy to boot, without all the usual wires, go get this beauty!
Don't buy the P25 if you want mobile computing. The battery life is short and the screen will be too dim to work comfortably unless you use the High Power setting which REALLY eats up the battery.
There is no way to operate the P25 in a car or plane. Power inverters DO NOT WORK with the P25 (I have tried 4) and the 19 volt input requirement rules out cigarette lighter
adapters.
Tech support is in Turkey.  Very pleasant people but  it takes a long time to get  a problem resolved. They don't seem to know this product very well. You will need them however because the on-board documentation (pdf) is awful. Example - I still haven't found the instructions for burning a CD.
I expected much more from Toshiba!
It's too bad that Toshiba has such horrible customer service. This machine is wonderful, as are most of their products. But if you have a problem and need help, they aren't there for you, they don't know their products and don't really care much about their customers.
The machine is lighter than I expected but huge. You need a special case if you plan on taking it anywhere. The battery last about 2 hours, not too bad for such a powerful machine. The WiFi connected right up to my home wireless network and the connection is great even from quite a distance. The screen is beautiful and the sound can't be beat on any laptop. It has 64mb video ram, I wish it were  128, but sure better than the standard 32mb. This laptop has a lpt and serial port where my 5205 only has USB. I did find that my external hard drive was not recognized on the rear USB port but was on the side USB port, not sure why yet. There are 4 USB 2.0 ports and the SD card slot with I use to copy photos from my Pentax digital camera to the laptop. All in all, it is a really great machine at a remarkable price for the features.
I've been waiting I don't know how long for a laptop/notebook that really IS a high-end desktop replacement, not just in the advertizing, but actually--and not just a throw-together from an unheard-of company, but from a major player. Toshiba has finally done it!
It blitzes the field on most major points: massive RAM (expandable to 2GB), although I would have liked to see faster RAM, generous hard drive (80GB, 5400rpm), although I would have liked to see 7200rpm, huge screen that is perfect for wide-screen movies, built-in TV tuner, the latest Wi-Fi capability built in (802.11a/g), four USB 2.0 ports, FireWire port, although the placement of this port is not ideal, legacy parallel port, although it has no legacy serial port, dual monitor support, external CD controls, DVD-Multi drive that does EVERYTHING in one 'box'!, built-in modem and ethernet, PCMCIA cardbus Type I and II, Harmon/Kardon speakers, although I am disappointed that Toshiba did not include the sub-woofer as with previous models, and so much more.
My only other disappointments (but not enough to dampen my enthusiasm) are the short battery life (1.5 hours, but this is to be expected with such a powerhouse), not the best bundled software (MSWorks instead of MSOffice?? Come on, guys!), average soundcard (but this is no problem with the plethora of USB and PCMCIA soundcards now available), and not the maximum graphics RAM (64MB... would have expected 128MB in an extreme machine like this).
When all is said and done, though, I'm stoked! I've taken out extra insurance on this baby!
Hace meses que estaba esperando que a la Serie P25 la proveyeran de todas las caractersticas para hacerla realmente una mquina equilibrada en s misma.
En verdad era un desperdicio adquirir un desktop replacement con una placa de video de solamente 32mb, y con un disco rgido de mediana capacidad y de slo 4200 rpm (aunque el actual siga siendo el punto ms flojo, por qu no le instalaron un HDD de 7200rpm?)
Un plus invalorable fue el de subirle la velocidad del procesador a 3.00GHz que con la tecnologa Hiper-Threading y los 1024Mb la hacen volar...
Otro acierto fue incorporarle el nuevo software Windows Media Center 2004, que hace ms amigable y fiable el ver y grabar programas de tv.
Como arquitecto, al trabajar con software que necesitan de  tecnologa de mucho poder para poder renderear las imgenes de los proyectos que diseo, esta laptop es realmente til a mis necesidades. La recomiendo a mis colegas.
Definitivamente vali esperar todo este tiempo, pero con la P25-S609,la Serie P25 lleg a su pinculo.
I bought this laptop in the first week of November. Its a good deal for me with all those rebates. Processor speed is good. The fan occasionally makes little, but hey , all laptops have some or the other issues these days..... Otherwise its an excellent buy. I myself was going for a dell...but considering dell's issues these days, I opted for the TOSHIBA........
My Toshiba notebook broke and they claim they fixed it because they sent it back within a day, but they didn't send back my power cord. So, I don't even know if it's been fixed or not. I've opened 3 trouble calls in the last 3 1/2 weeks and received no response or power cord. Seems like a simple task to complete. Major failure in customer service.  Spare yourselves the same frustration with Toshiba.
You get what you pay for - the Toshiba A15-S129 is a value-priced laptop. While it is Toshiba's entry-level laptop, it provides the features needed for the majority of us sitting in front of a computer screen. Compared with similarly priced laptops (before the $$$ rebates), the Toshiba A15-S129 does boast a faster processor (2.4 ghz celeron) and the 32 mb video card is more than adequate for most tasks (watching DVDs, word-processing, cruising the net). Included in the price is a combination DVD/CD Writer (most entry level laptops have a CD player). My Toshiba A15-S129 came with one 256 mb memory stick, with an open slot - making it easy to increase the memory without having to discard one of two 128 mb memory sticks (normally provided by other manufacturers) when upgrading.
The Toshiba support website is not the best. You have to telephonically contact sales/support personnel for assistance in ordering accessories. You cannot use email to contact their support personnel. They do have a search mechanism available (Ask Iris) to help resolve issues that have been voiced by other Toshiba users, as well as a support/discussion group sponsored by a third-party.
I am satisfied with my A15-S129 - and even happier when I cashed the rebate checks!
It has a mediocre processor at best (Celerons are just awful at handling graphics), very little RAM, a small hard drive, a very puny graphics card (32 megs, but they must have figured 'why waste graphic horsepower to push a Celeron'), and no wireless connectivity. Also, it is neither svelte nor is it cheap.
I can fully understand the concept and occasional appropriateness of bare-bones, entry level machines but I would suggest the interested buyer also consider the Gateway 200 or the Averatec 3150.
I have recently baught one, it is a good computer. Got a good deal on it, which made it afordable, it even plays my games well.
I would highly recommend upgrading the memory on this laptop.  I added a 512 mb memory stick to the pre-installed 256 mb the day after I got the laptop.  256 mb of memory makes the 2.4 GHz processor seem really slow.  It's only a Celeron, but after upgrading the memory to 768 mb, I haven't used my Athalon XP 2000+ desktop computer w/ 1 GB of ram & 300 GB hard disk space.

There's a slot for an internal WiFi card as well.  I added that even though I had a WiFi PCMCIA card.  It frees up the PCMCIA slot for my firewire card.  It's also a lot better than having to remove the WiFi card, that stick out of my laptop, when I have to put it in my laptop bag.

I say if you upgrade the memory it can be more than an entry level laptop.  I can do everything I could on my Home PC that I can on my laptop.  Especially with the addition of my firewire card, external DVD+RW drive, external hard drive.

I would also recommend getting a laptop cooler, as most laptops get hot.

I bought this laptop for the price alone after mail in rebate and am very happy with it.  Two thumbs up.
And installed SuSE Linux 9.1 Professional. The next thing I did was bump the RAM up from 256MB to 512MB. Overall I am pleased with the performance and reliability of the system. Battery life has been consistantly around 2 Hours and 10 Minutes running Linux generally with multiple accounts open and over 140 processes running.

If I have to run Windows (usually because I have to fix someone elses bad coding...), I will only use Windows 2000 Pro inside of VMWare while running my Linux OS native. Haven't had any heating problems, no data loss issues, heck the darn thing just works. It's been dropped once, luck me no major damage. And smacked against the table (in my backpack I carry it in) a few times. The case has some nicks and dings but everthing just works!

I use it to program C/C++ and Java applications as well as tinker with Oracle databases on occassion. I also play some pretty intense 3D games as well, although the FPS is a bit sluggish at times, it's not bad enough to stop me from playing.

About the only thing I really have a complaint about is the fan, noisy as all get out! I have removed it and checked the bearings and made sure it was clean of debris, but it's still pretty noisy.

I sometimes will leave the system on 24/7 for up to a week while I am compiling code or running a series of tests against UNIX main frames or other Linux systems. Overall the only other thing I will change is the hard drive, 40GB is pretty small for what I do. But overall I recommend getting rid of Microsoft Windows on this system... completely and install Linux, preferably SuSE, and enjoy virus free, pop-up free internet time! It's worth it!
This is an overall nice computer. It has a wonderful Modem, but has some flaws to it. If you hit the backspace button, it will go Back(internet). That does not help when you are trying to fill an order. Its price is wonderful though. I got this one for $499 with a free printer. Overall, it is a nice computer.
Send to Toshiba (submitted it to Amazon)
I've never been as disappointed with a computer as with this one.  The worst thing about it: I'm in the middle of typing a paragraph, and suddenly my cursor has magically transported itself two paragraphs up the page -- unbeknowst to me.  So the last two sentences I've typed are now in the middle of the wrong paragraph.  Or, I'm in the middle of typing something and all of a sudden the last three sentences I've typed highlight themselves automatically and disappear in a cloud of smoke.  This can happen over and over again in as little as a five-minute period.
Toshiba said I could prevent this by pressing the FN key and the F9 key whenever I type anything.  But what that does is disable the cursor -- so that you're completely prevented from moving it from one place to another on any internet page.  Even in a word processing document, it's a real slow-down to have to have nothing but the arrow keys to move your cursor to various places in the document.
Also: even with the cursor enabled, it's difficult sometimes to get it to go where I want it to go.  Whether I'm trying to move the cursor with the touch pad, the PgUp and PgDn keys, or the arrow keys, the cursor just doesn't move sometimes -- unless I take the time to stop, move it around on the desktop, and then try again to move it.
... It has seen a lot of use ... .  Great for watching DVDs on road trips (although you'll need a DC adapter, the battery won't last for a full movie). Battery life is pretty good though, if you're using programs resident on the hard drive.  The only problems I've had have been OS related (but we all know MS sux).  Burns CDs fast & reliable.  As fast as I expected for a Celeron.  Display is not the best I've seen, but is large and bright.  The only problem I see going forward is that the display hinge seems flimsy .. close it with 2 hands on the sides...  On physical construction, probably not the most solid laptop.  Daily laptop users may want to consider different units.  All in all much much better than I expected for the price.
I own this laptop for 5 weeks now and it works great. First I was worried abt the celeron processor since i thought it will be damn slow. But then my thinking was wrong. I also own another Toshiba that has centrino processer. This one is almost 80% fast as centrino. If u want to use the laptop for word, excel, powerpoint applns and to surf the web, burn cds , this one is excellent choice.
The only con i can report is since the design is not slim, even though its stated as 6.2 pounds, it seems like its a bit bulk..but for this price, its unbeatable. I highly recommend this laptop for personal/home use.
ok, so i bought 5 of these for my business. they all have the same problem. after it works great for a few months, it starts overheating and shutting itself off. not a good laptop to buy...i lost a lot of money. it's a design flaw and there are class action suits against toshiba. the processor fan is underneath the laptop so it can't take in any cool air to cool the processor.
This is a great laptop except for the buttons with the touchpad that feel like they are damaged or will be soon. Performs like you would expect for the configuration listed ... just great. Very light with almost 3 hours of battery life if you plan to move a lot with it.
I purchased the Toshiba Satellite A15-S129 (Celeron 2.4GHz) about eight weeks ago and it has surpassed all my expectations! My previous laptop was also a Toshiba but I was lured by the "bells and whistles" that came with the Compaq Presario (P4 - 2.3GHz) and HP Pavilion (AMD Athlon XP-M 2500+) notebooks - Also more expensive! I bought both of these laptops but promptly returned them after encountering problems with the CD burner on the Compaq and noting a rhythmic "clicking" noise when idle on the HP.
If you're like me and use the computer mainly for word processing, accounting, websurfing, emailing, listening to music, and watching DVDs, the Celeron processor has way more than enough 'pep'. In fact, the speed appears to be comparable to the P4 and AMD chips, both of which I had an opportunity to test. Given that the other two laptops had faster CPUs, more RAM and L2 cache, I thought I would easily see a difference in speed when opening and running programs or accessing web pages. However, this wasn't the case. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised by Celeron's speed and efficiency, noting no appreciable difference in performance compared to either chip.
This computer has worked flawlessly since I bought it. Installing software and adding new hardware are a snap -essentially idiot proof. The USB ports instantly recognized and "sync-ed" with my PDA, digital camera, and USB flash drive upon connection. The TFT screen is bright and very sharp. The DVD player plays movies effortlessly and the speaker sound is undoubtedly superior to the Compaq and HP units! No problems playing a 2-hr movie on battery power so far. Surfing the web and CD burning are incredibly fast. In addition, I really like the soft quiet keyboard, the light weight of this laptop, and many Toshiba touchpad options. Don't do this but last week I accidently spilled half a cup of water on the keyboard and pretty much thought I killed my computer. After allowing it to dry for 8-10 hours, I turned it back on and everything amazingly worked fine. This is a testament to Toshiba's durability and design.
Drawbacks include its larger size in the front-to-back dimension (i.e. it barely fits vertically in my old laptop case), limited CD burning software, battery life (if you're always on the go), and only 2 USB ports. If you want to play high-end graphics games or need wireless connectivity, this computer may not be your first choice. Keep in mind that you can always buy more RAM or add a network card, as needed.
If you're looking for a solid, affordable desktop replacement with an occasional need for mobility, this computer is an excellent investment. Don't be fooled into paying more for bell and whistles on other notebooks. Before buying, ask yourself what you really need the laptop for on a daily basis.  In the end, I could not justify paying $300 or more for a computer that would not be used to its full potential. And when it's time to buy a new laptop in a few years, you can bet that mine will be a Toshiba.
A fantastic ultra portable laptop. I bought the 12" Powerbook G4 1Ghz, and have been blown away by it. It has a good metallic design and its size is very easy to carry around, this is the major disadvantage of larger bulkier notebooks. I have had mine upgraded to 1.25 GB Ram, and the performance of applications like Microsoft Office and Adobe Photoshop is great. You can even play games like Halo on it pretty well, if that is your thing. You can have up to 80GB of HD, and my advice is to buy the largest you can afford. I also have an Airport (802.11g) card installed, and it allows wireless connectivity with a pretty good range. In addition, Bluetooth built-in allowed me to use a very nice wireless mouse with it.  The Keyboard is of good quality, an important feature if you have to write long documents in Word! The LCD screen is of good quality too. All in all it made a pleasant switch from my previous bulky Sony Vaio Lap.  I would recommend this computer very highly.
Yeah, I know it's a little more money than the knock-off PC clones from Dell and Gateway, but this is a far superior computer. The Mac platform is not only the most powerful one available, it is also the simplest and most versatile - once you learn it.
The 15-inch is the perfect size for me. I looked at both the 12 and 17-inch models and felt they were a little too small/big respectively. There is something attractive about the 12 inch - a friend of mine has one and he carries it around everywhere, able to write anywhere anytime. And seated at a desk the 17-inch is also attractive, presenting a massive, bright screen to work on. But all in all, the 15-inch provides the best both worlds. It's very portable - maybe not as easy to tug along as the 12-inch, but certainly manageable with a small backpack. The 17-inch can be problematic on a plane if there are people crowding you, and it's certainly cumbersome to maneuver in tight spaces, whereas the 12-inch is easy to maneuver but can cause a little eyestrain from a distance.
I definitely recommend a Mac, first of all, and within that I recommend the 15-inch G4 notebook. If you must have a 12-inch, you might take a look at the 12-inch iBook, which is cheaper but obviously not as feature rich (the iBook's graphics card is not as powerful and the processor is slower, most notably).
The complaints I have are exterior - the computer doesn't age well (i.e., it nicks and scratches rather easily) and there should be some sort of elevation device to raise the back end while typing (like the older Powerbooks had).
All in all you can't go wrong with any Apple laptop you choose. They are truly making the digital life a reality with all of their integrated software - iTunes, iPhoto, iSight, and the iPod are particularly cool. No other laptop will have an operating system with so many fantastic programs that are so perfectly integrated together. If this is remotely in your price range, go for it. It can literally change the way you operate on a day-to-day basis.
PROS:  The TR2A is a full featured system in an incredibly small and lightweight package. Despite the small size the screen is excellent and the keyboard usable. Before the Vaio I used to dread lugging my full sized laptop on trips. The Vaio goes with me everywhere. Battery life is not 15 hours (an absurd claim) but is long enough for a 7 hour flight and then some. Some nice touches such as a switch at the front to turn wireless lan off / on. It is not a CAD or graphics workstation, nor is it intended to be.  Great WOW factor.
CONS:  Should have a DVD burner and not just CD burner. For sake of future compatibility, 802.11G wireless would be nice as well. Sony should include the recovery media instead of requiring you to order it or burn it to a dozen plus CD's (since there is no DVD burner). Probably the best subnotebook available at the moment although it seems they cut a few corners in terms of the DVD and wireless. Heck, at least provide a cheap vinyl zipper case and a printed copy of the manual.
Do consider the TR2AP3.  For not much more $$$ you get twice the memory, XP Pro, and 802.11 B AND G.  TR2 is great, I only wish the AP3 configuration had been available when I bought mine.
Okay, this is a niche product that fills its niche so magnificently that it deserves all 5 stars. It is solidly built and yet so light it almost defies explanation. The processor is not only a very capable 1 gigahertz, but as a Centrino tuned Pentium, it throws off less heat and is much more miserly with its battery use. The optical drive will play and record CDs and will play DVDs beautifully on an extra crisp 10.6" screen (and battery life is longer than any DVD I can think of).
The hard drive is an adequate 40 gigs. The connections are fine, including two USB 2.0s, and the built in 802.11 wireless is foolproof. I find I have no problems with the ergonomics of the keyboard or touchpad, though I do keep a tiny USB optical mouse in my case for hotel stays, etc.
Overall, this is the ideal 2nd computer, especially for a student or for a frequent flyer. Sony has been pretty good about backing their products in case you have a problem, though mine has not even hiccupped yet. The only extra expense I had was finding a small enough case to carry it in, and that was very much a pleasant purchase!
I want to buy this product with Turkish keyboard and I want to pay in 12 months with my credit card. Is it possible?Is the guarrantie available in turkey?
Well, I recently bought the FRV-37 Notebook. It's nice when you want speed, space of hard drive..but when i want to burn DVD's it have a constant WRITE ERROR... I'm from Chile and i don't have garanty here because i bought in USA on my vacation... That's the only wrong thing about this computer... But it's too importante because it's the more expensive part of this laptop..
If you know how to repair it please write me at : juanpa_10@hotmail.com
Thanks a Lot
I've had my SONY VAIO FRV37 for 2 days, and it is going back.  I keep getting  a write error  when making recovery DVD's, ruined 4 of them already.  They were going to suggest I do the 10 CD method but before it was out of the mouth, I said nope.  Then they wanted to send me recovery DVDs for free, but why does the DVD writer keep having a write-error from the get go.  Reminds me of a Toshiba I once owned that I could not make recovery work after making floppies for recovery (24 of THEM!) that was junk from Day 1 and eventually had a class action suit against them that Toshiba lost, but the settlement was puny considering the grief that thing gave me.  Now, Sony has to go back.  CSR said he would take it back rather than take the free recovery DVDs, too.  That's good enough for me.  Do I give them another chance, or do I buy something else?
I had a lot of trouble upgrading from XP Home that came bundled with my FRV37 to XP Professional. I had to do a fresh installation of XP Pro that formatted my machine. This also resulted in loosing all of the preloaded software. I just ordered for a set of Recovery DVD's from sony for $35. I fail to understand why Sony wants to save on recovery CDs...
Customers beware!!! Do not try updrading the machine to XP Professional. Sony does not support it.
If you are looking for a portable computer this SONY is simply awesome.  A notebook or laptop it is not; its big and heavy by todays standards but the performance is fantastic!
The Gateway desktop died (will never buy from them again) and couldn't be brought back to life so I decided to pick up a "notebook".  The FRV37 is blazing fast, the screen is large, bright and clear & its got plenty of HD space (if you need more consider getting an external USB hard drive).  With a CD and a DVD burner you really don't need a desktop machine anymore.  It comes with a nice software bundle.  Its got firewire built in and is great for capturing video from digital video cameras.  If you go on vacation, take this computer, a Sony or Canon Digitial video cam and an Olympus digital camera and everyone on the trip can go home with CDs or DVDs of the trip.
Buy this machine if you want to replace your desktop, you don't need long bettery life (it gets about 2 hours max), and you want something portable but not light weight.  The only thing missing is built in wireless but for about $50.00 you can get a wireless card that will do the trick.  This computer has NEVER crashed unlike all previous computers (desktops from Gateway) that crashed frequently.
Only 4 stars because its heavy, has short battery life and missing built in wireless.
Ok, I just got a new VAIO PCG-FRV37 and it has been great in every aspect but I don't understand why Sony doesnt include a backup recovery CD along with the computer. I never knew until I actually bought one, if i did, i would have never bought a Sony. Oh, I will never buy a Sony ever again. The fact that they want to sell me a recovery CD for a laptop I paid $1500 for pisses me off. Anyhow, great machine but not so great company.
First of all, even though this is a 60 gig drive, you only get 50 g of usable space. Seems they reserved 10g for restoring.  You are supposed to be able to use some dvd-rw to restore it (there is no restore cd included), however, it won't let me. I'm not about to sit down w/ 10+ cd-r's to do this.  They give you lots of software, but nothing that great.  I had been using an old version of Quicken.  The Quicken 2003 that came with it would not let me import the info w/o buying the upgraded version.
All in all it's a good package though.  the documentation that comes in the box is more ad's for sony products than actual info on your $1600 investment.  I can't find out the actual dvd burning speed, but it appears that it is only 1x.  boo
This barely gets the fourth star.
Good, but could have been better.
Bought the computer on my trip to Honolulu Hawaii on Oct. 21. On a business trip to Japan, the hard drive failed and could not get it fixed at Sony Dealers in Japan. Was told that must send to San Diego, CA to get fixed. Recent quotation is $700 plus. Never buy Sony made in China. Will never buy Sony...period.
--------------------
I don't think it is such a GREAT notebook as some people are talking about it. The 3 things I don't like about it are:
1. It comes with Windows XP Home. What you will do with all this super configuration without certain features like Backup and Automated Recovery, IIS, Remote Desktop connection etc. which doesn't come with XP Home edition. The worst part is Toshiba doesn't support the upgrade (I called up Toshiba to confirm this after looking at the review by Thomas Fitzgibbon below). You have to spend another $300 to get XP pro which puts the cost of this notebook equals to or even greater than some good note books available in the market.
2. The DVD writer comes with it can only write on to DVD -R disks. While the whole industry is turning to +R type, it would be better if you have a writer that writes on to both +/- types. And none the less the speed of the writer is disappointing (1x and 2x).
3. Hard drive size and battery life are also disappointing.
I am not saying tha it is a bad one but definitely there is a room for improvement in this model for the price we are paying and thus it is not all that great and super duper notebook that you can have.
This is a great notebook for all my applications. I even got great customer support when I messed up some settings. I got this to be able to more seemlessly have my work files available for those inspirational moments.  It worked great out of the box and is actually better than my work PC.  Not bad for most games either. Beautiful screen.  Get one now for an upgrade!
Two points have been brought up that should be addressed.
1.  There is a workaround to upgrade to XP Pro on the Microsoft web site. I've not done this yet but it is nice to know it can be done.  It involves shutting off a couple of apps, loading the system, and turning them back on.  The Toshiba script kitties are not qualified to tell you the details.  Do a google search!
2. For it's price this laptop stands up well.  The next computer in this line I would buy costs at least $2K, and I shopped hard and long before selecting this model.
This is not the top of line laptop for all purposes.  It does what I need (business apps, most games, graphics) for less money than I would have spent elsewhere.  It's that benefit/cost ratio that got my attention.  It just suits my immediate, and foreseeable, needs.
I purchased the P15-S409 4 days ago. The unit would not resume from hiberanate or standby mode. Micro center agreed with me - its broke. Laptop # 2 -ran just fine -I see no problems, so far, but the PC is unusable. WHY? - it does not sit FLAT on any desktop!! hard to imagine that an $1,700 would be shipped with a BENT laptop base. The unit rocks about a quarter of an inch!!
Laptop #3 (I love the punishment) will be picked up tonight.
I will keep you posted...
Just bought the P15-S409.  So far so good.  Until I called support in Istanbul Turkey.  Polite but only capable of telling me official Toshiba policies and not caring about actually solving the problem.  To quote them: "Toshiba does not support upgrades from XP Home to Pro".  Well gee, I guess I'll throw this computer away and buy a new one.  Nothing like having a product represented by a third party that doesn't give a.
I recently bought the Satellite P15-S409 and I'm very happy with it so far. The system configuration is excellent, the screen size and picture definition are very good, and the price beats most competing brands offering the same features. I considered buying the Dell 8600 which is a great machine too but the Toshiba P15 offered the 2.8GHz Pentium IV processor with HT, a SD memory card slot, and an extra USB2 port which is always useful.
There are only 3 issues with the P15 that if corrected would make of this a kick ass laptop: Replace XP Home with the Pro version, improve the sound system, and make it a little less bulky.
Other than that, the Toshiba P15 is a great buy and will most likely satisfy the needs of demanding users like myself.
overall the computer is a great buy. everyone was like who that is a big screen. after a while you get used to it and you love it. and so do they. 2.8 ghz is amazing and the hard drive is the perfect size for any gamer, or business man/woman. the only problem i had and still have is finding a carrying case for it. again it is a great computer for anyone.
I purchased this model online about a week ago, and I'm already in love with it.  This model comes with a desktop-class Pentium 4 processor with hyper-threading technology...you can feel the power as you cruch through the most complex applications.  While I can't call myself a hardcore gamer, I did watch several DVDs on this notebook.  Toshiba loads the PC with software that makes this widescreen notebook a portable theartre.  The beautifully crisp picture looked awesome on the widescreen display.
The only "constructive critisms" I could think of...the battery life runs only over an hour-and-a-halfish, on maximum performance mode, but this is to be expected, as this little devil crams a lot of bang in a small package.  Other than that, this is a great computer, and I'm very happy that I choose Toshiba, and will likely again in the future.
I have had this computer for approx. one month.  It can completely replace a desktop.  At 2.8 GHz the processor smokes and the wireless connection is great.  I was able to easily connect with a linksys router.  It will work with a 802.11b router but comes equipped with an integrated 802.11g wireless LAN.  It comes with a DVD multi and I have successfully copied several DVD's for my personal backup. It has 512 MB DDR SDRAM which I specifically looked for.  It is expandable to over 2GB RAM.  It comes with a 60 gig HD.
This computer runs very cool. Most of the laptops I have experience with run pretty hot. The 15.4 in. screen is beautiful.  The full size keyboard is comfortable and the computer overall feels light considering the screen size.  The speakers aren't that bad, and actually put out pretty good sound as opposed to the usual tinny sounding speakers.
I compared price to options, etc, and found this to be an excellent deal for the money.
The only dissapointment is battery life, which seems to be about 1 percent loss per minute no matter what I might be doing on the computer, streaming (audio/video), or just surfing the internet.  It is supposed to have about a two and a half hour battery life and that is not the case with mine.  I considered dropping my rating to 4 stars because of the battery, but I am so pleased with overall performance that I stayed with 5 stars.
I searched and compared, high and low, came up with this and am extremely pleased overall.
I bought this laptop because some business applications I must use required the graphics card installed.  The applications ran beautifully.  That done, I began to appreciate this computer for its other strengths.  Although I have always been a small, light, tiny keyboard computer guy, I have now hopelessly converted to this "full size" laptop.  Yes, it weighs more, but the display is fabulous (better than my old monitor at home), the keyboard is large enough to allow me to work all day, and the wireless connectivity is great.
  This computer is good for a desktop replacement.  It is also good for a traveling businessman like myself who needs real power and who enjoys a screen that allows relaxed viewing.  Great for middle-aged eyes!
I agree with most of the stuff other people wrote about the M35-S359. It is a very good notebook computer. However, Toshiba has some of the worst keyboard layouts. The Insert and Delete keys are situated such that one presses them often accidentally. Instead of being close to the spacebar, the frequently used Windows keys are tiny keys in the upper right hand corner. On the other hand, the rarely used function (Fn) key is oversized and between the Control and Alt key. In addition, Toshiba keyboards have a mushy feel. Both in terms of layout and key movement, Compaq has much better notebook keyboards. The wide width of the M35-S359 provides ample of space for a full size keyboard with nice layout. Unfortunately this space is wasted with various buttons and LEDs that could be at a different location. If Toshiba had taken advantage of the wide width and provided a full size keyboard with the Insert, Delete, Home, End, Page Up, and Page Down keys in the traditional 2x3 configuration, the inverted-T cursor keys below these keys like on a traditional keyboard, and fixed the click/feel of the keys, this would have been a truly awesome notebook. I have a few other minor gripes about this notebook: there is no PS/2 port to connect a traditional keyboard/mouse and the wireless adapter is only 802.11b (instead of the faster and backward compatible 802.11g).  In any case, given the features and price, this machine is one of the best deals.
I have just bought a new M35-S359. This  is my first laptop and I have thought very much about the brand and the model of it. Toshiba was a very good choice for me. In this price range it offers a Centrino Processor which has indeed a very good performance with low battery consumption. Also its Widescreen feature makes you to watch DVD's in great quality and comfort.
All software comes within a DVD and you don't bother much with tons of CD's.
It has international warranty and an universal frequency adapter which allows you to use the laptop anywhere around the world.
It has got quality Harman/Kardon speakers which sounds very good. The keyboard layout is very comfortable.
I can say in this price you won't find any model with Centrino processor and with the quality of Toshiba..
I recently purchased a Windows laptop to be shared with another person. It's a Toshiba...one of the Centrino based, wide screen models (M35-S359). The closest Apple choice would be the 15" Powerbook w/combo drive. The Toshiba has some definite advantages along with a lower price tag.
From a hardware standpoint, I am quite pleased with this machine. The keyboard/trackpad design, in particular, is very good...full size dedicated page navigation keys, a dedicated key to bring up contextual menus, another one to call up the Start menu, a two-button trackpad with scrolling support...
Battery life has been solid, the screen is sharp and the built-in SD card slot matches the format used by my digital camera.
On the down side...as expected, battery life hasn't quite matched the published specs and the optical drive is a bit noisy.
For an extra $230US, Toshiba added a 3 year warranty with "express" pickup/delivery and coverage against accidental damage. The total cost, with spare AC adapter, was approx. $1860US.
As for the software involved, things are different. The bundled extras are useful, but Windows XP doesn't quite match up with Mac OS X. Visually and aesthetically, XP is a bit of an eyesore. Also, the process of setting up the computer to our liking has been a chore. Much of the system has a clumsy, awkward design. In contrast, the System Preferences application in OS X is a joy to use.
One example...the laptop shipped with two different power saving utilities. One from Microsoft and the other from Toshiba. Each had different settings for the same usage and each insisted on adding its own battery meter to the Taskbar. I finally discovered that the Toshiba version was calling the shots.
Another hassle has been the tedious chore of protecting the system against viruses, worms, spyware, Microsoft come-ons, pop-up's, etc.
Once past the setup stage, I've found that actually using the Toshiba isn't all that bad. The Windows "experience" isn't as polished as with the Mac, but it's serviceable. I can still run iTunes, QuickTime Player, Mozilla, Quicken...along with the wide range of Windows-only titles. Word and Excel, for now at least, share essentially the same file format across platforms. The machine won't be used to edit video or audio or high-res photos. If it can handle my digitized Ramones collection, then I'll be happy;)
Had this computer been bought for my use only, I might well have gone with the 15" Powerbook (the iBook isn't quite enough). I'm not certain of that, though. It is a tough call.
This is not meant to be a full, all-inclusive review.  These are just the points that did not meet my expectations.
1. It doesn't look as good as in pictures.  In fact, I think it looks ugly.
2. The sound is way too soft.  There is no function key to control volume.  At the top volume, you can barely hear sound from movies or music.
3. The 4200 rpm hard disk makes the computer sloooow when running more than one application at a time.
Those were my major gripes.  It actually is an OK laptop - but who buys an OK laptop when they can buy the best?  The screen is nice, Intel's integrated wireless is cool, it comes with a DVD player ... everything else is pretty much what you would expect from a 15" laptop.
My old laptop was creaking and I called the best computer nerd I knew. "Get the new Toshiba with the 1.4GHz M chip", he told me and am I glad I listened. This is a beautiful laptop. It is thin, light and the battery lasts seemingly forever. The XGA display is bright and crisp and the Harmon/Kardon speakers produce clear and rich audio.
My big concern was speed, but the reality is that the 1.4GHz chip acts like it is running at much higher speeds. The 15 inch wide screen makes word processing much more readable.
You cannot miss with this laptop!
PCGFRV31 VAIO Notebook
This is a good home computer, but it may not be the powerhouse you are looking for.
Beware of the following misleading information
1. 64 video MB is intergrated. It is part of your 512 MB total. This is not a separate 64MB of video ram that it leads you to believe.
2. 40GB, make that 32GB. C drive has 13.9 GB and the D drive has 18.2GB. You do the math.
So is it worth the retail $1199.99 average price? Probably not. If you can get rebates that lower it to under $1000.00 then maybe you should consider it.
Another odd thing is that the LCD screen seems to act up at times. It seems to have a subtle vibrating/blinking type of problem.
Overall this notebook is only above average.
I ordered my Ibook on the 5th of Dec. 2003 received it on the 10th. Right out of the box it malfunctioned so they offered to repair it.  That was the 10th of Dec.  Now its Jan, 5/2004 still not fixed.  I've talked to so many diff customer service represents, they are all courteous but none of them know whats going on.  For about 15 days in Dec. the laptop was lost!!! they had no idea where it was.  They are always trying to transfer you to another person who is just as unhelpful and would put me on hold hours at a time.  I even spoke to one person who kept on refering to Apple as Phillips and I would correct him every now and then asking him, Dont you mean apple?  I mean come on!! at least know what company you work for.  I tried returning it but they won't let me on technicality and I had it for less than 2 days.  Talk about frustrating experience..go get a dell
terrific customer service and you actually get to talk to people who know the name of their own company.
Looks like Apple hit a home run with this one. This has been the best upgrade since my LC.  With Panther my 933 is one fast machine. I downloaded US Army and it runs that with no problems. Max out the memory and get Apple Care. With broadband this one great appliance.
First of all, let me say that I paid the 1500 dollars in September, before they changed all the iBooks to G4s and the USB ports to 2.0 .  Why is this important?  Well, a few reasons.  Final Cut Pro only works on G4s.  I paid 699 dollars for the upgrade that my computer could certainly handle, however the software was designed to look for a G4 or G5 in order for installing.  So, as that wouldn't have been too aggrivating until I tried to take it back to CompUSA which I soon found out has a zip-O-la return policy, I got a bit peeved at both CompUSA and Apple Software design.  Well, within two months of my purchase the 'new' G4 iBooks were on the net to buy, and I had my answer on Apples ideas for makeing a touch more money by getting me to buy a new laptop, if I want to run something like.. oh Final Cut Pro, or some animation software on the market.
However, the reason I put five stars wasn't Apple's beautiful software marketing and design, or CompUSAs ability to move a person to consider programming a video game thats objective is strangling CompUSA employees.
The real reason is that for laptops, and for this price, it is a quality laptop.  You see, I can't justify to myself paying over 1500 of a base price for a tool that I'm going to be using out of my home.  At any moment it could be stolen and I am much more at peace with a loss of 1500 dollars for a top of the line iBook which can be much more readily replaced than 3000 dollars for a top of the line PowerBook.
My laptop has survived a 2 ft plus drop while open from a bed to a not so plush carpeted floor.  There wasn't too much destruction done other than some of the lineing on the left edge of the screen and the battery doesn't fit as smoothly as before.  Everything still works, including all the ports I use, like the USB, firewire, 56K Modem, and the Adapter port.  It works fine on battery and plugged in, so I really didn't lose any functionality.
The laptop operating system doesn't break down, although it does freeze every once in a while.  The software that it comes with is very useful, and handy, and not as annoying as say, windows media player..  The text editing software that it comes with is ahhhhh!!!ggrrr.. when you try to program html initially.. fortunately, after going to the preferences you can fix this loading html pages as a web browser does initial setting.  iTunes is fun, and useful, and the only drawback is that it doesn't read the song encoding on CDs that Windows Media Player does.  So you have to either manually type the name of the song in by hand, or buy your songs off the internet at a buck a piece.  The iPhoto works fine and allows for some adjustment, but if you're into adjusting your photos, use nothing less than Adobe Photoshop Elements 2.0 .  Photoshop might well be a waste of 600 plus dollars if you get good at Elements 2.0 .  In fact.. I'd dare say Adobe Illustrator and Elements 2.0 could be a grand combo.  Safari is a good browser with annoyances with interpreting java on the web.  No joke, web browsers that understand Java well on the web on macs are rare as leopard seals.  There is only two of them.  One is the Microsoft Internet Explorer(who stopped making new IEs for mac because Safari does everything it does) and the other is Safari.  Every other web browser.. say.. mozilla??  like Netscape 7.01, Firebird .7 and Mozilla and Camino seem to all be carbonized.  And the problem?  Well, for some reason, carbonizing does not like Java or something.  No Java, no chatting, or java online gaming.  So the only chatting you can do say on Yahoo is on Safari and IE.  No problem, they are both free.  And Safari is included with all the new macs.  But for your daily web browsing, you might want to download Firebird .7 .  After you get the tab browsing down and the various keyboard commands, you will find its just the best daily browser out there.  It runs secure bank transactions in xml fine and quickly.  As a bonus AppleWorks comes with every new iBook, so you definitely have a decent word processor.  But don't be fooled with the Microsoft Office that seems to be included, Microsoft wouldn't forgoe a profit that easily.  The Microsoft Office on the computer is a 30 day trial.  Office X is 500 dollars.  Not too much for full licensing for a single user.  And well worth it if you're in college or otherwise use it frequently.  Look at QuarkXPress for some serious pricing.. oww.  The clock is nifty and calendar is useful, and the internet options are easily read in the upper menu bar.  And for entertainment, you can talk to the computer and it will do what you say.. if you can speak it well enough for the computer.. you know.. the standard speech recognition flaw.  The fun thing about all this is that you talk to the chess game and play an entire chess game by speaking alone.  It's actually pretty nifty.
There is enough computer software out there for the mac, especially if you want to get work done and you work with video or images.  The Mac OS X and Mac OS 9.2 don't save files quite the same way which can be a touch annoying if you are using old macs at school still.  You have to specify the exact program to open this or that file between the two operating systems.  This is easy enough.. as long as its only a file or two, come ten or so, and it gets a bit annoying.  On the good end, it is more compatable with pcs now.  There is a decent software translation of Windows XP for purchase for ultimate compatability.  Wasn't too bad, but as always.. anything Microsoft runs as slow as a slug.  Try a G5 if you want to run the Windows XP translation a lot.  If Windows XP freezes, it doesn't freeze OS X, and thats kinda nice.  Adobe has most of there popular software available on the mac, and so does Macromedia.  And Living Language has their 9.0 versions of Language Lessons in plenty of European and Asian languages available on Mac.  Also, if your into Video, Adobe dropped Premiere because Final Cut Pro was kicking their but in earning the market share.  And if your into animation software, Cinema 4D 8.5v and Maya 5 both support mac, as well as Lightwave.  So as far as getting something done, the mac is awesome.. it doesn't freeze much if you treat it decent(don't run a zillion programs at once).  It simply works, and has better compatability than Linux.  Although Linux rocks too, Mac OS X is a Unix base with more compatability.  It is simply more compatable with stability than Linux.  Microsoft Windows?  Well, its compatable with a bonus of being hacked and virus wrecked and blue screened every so often.  In other words... Microsoft Windows tends to limit me getting anything done.. particularly in Graphics Design degree which of course is only macs.
As far as games, of course most of the games out there are made for windows.  On the other hand, many might argue that if you are a real gamer, you own an XBox or a PS2 already.  Besides, Microsoft XP is available for Mac.  Like I said, get a G5 for that kind of thing.
The chatting programs?  Well, Windows Messenger, Yahoo Messenger, and AOL instant messenger, as well as the OS X customized iChat version of AOL instant messenger that comes with any new mac.  The Yahoo Messenger can't do as much as it can on Windows.. on the other hand.. it doesn't get hacked like the one on Windows, which doesn't freeze my computer, which makes my life a bit easier.
If you're into video, you should remember two things.. one, VCD format.  You know, that old laser disk format that any CD burner can place on a CD-R/RW.  two.. if your into business cards, the business card CD-Rs can hold video flash presentations as well.  So, basically, if your not looking for 2 hour movies on a dvd, you can easily burn animations as well as edit them from the CD-Rs on the iBooks.  The other detail is that 400 firewire is the only thing sold on iBooks.  800 firewire is considered 'professional'.  However, although my 400 dollar Olympus digital camera can make short videos, it, like many Digital Cameras on the market, does not have firewire.  In fact, that is much more likely to be restricted to digital camcorders.  Such as my Digital Camcorder does have.  Still, you still have to look for a firewire port, not all camcorders have them.
Hopefully, you found my review helpful.  Oh, one more helpful hint.  Certain Epson scanners come with Photoshop Elements 2.0 .  A good piece of software with a needed accessory.  I definitely recommend it.  ArcSoftware is the usual accessory.  Don't be fooled.. although its fun and useful, for work with multiple photos, nothing beats Elements 2.0 .
Hope you all enjoy this laptop if you buy it.  Obviously every business is out to make money and Apple is no different.  But Apple OS X and Apple laptops as a combo are better and more useful than nearly anything with Windows on it.

I've owned three iBooks.  The clamshell was a sturdy design, but heavy and limited.  My G3 iBook 800 was great, worked well, but the screen was a little small (dense) and it didn't quite fit on the lap.  Plus I wasn't a fan of the drive tray.  So this new design is far better.  It is much sturdier.  They replaced EVERY material in construction for the better, improved battery life, and it is much faster.  It might just be the perfect laptop at any price.  For most people, it can even replace a desktop.  Comes with tony hawk, plays beautifully.  All other apps I have work perfectly, airport extreme is faster than airport, and keyboard is MUCH better (no longer squishy, better feedback).  You will not regret buying this machine.  Not sure that the 1GHz is worth the extra money.  This model hits the sweet spot.
This computer was in pretty bad shape (dirty, beat-up).  It also did not have very much memory and could not perform many tasks.  It was a Christmas present for my son and he was very disappointed.
Can't do anything on it It was a old computerWould love to return it and get my money back yes my money back
This item is great, my son enjoys it much in his school work and other stuff for home use.
I know when I order it was used but I didn't expect it to be dirty. Never showed it to son. I rather buy brand new. I returned it.
This product is old tech. the display is dull,I sent mine back and bought a macbook.
Amazing!!
Forrest for the trees, I saw the price and didn't realize how old the computer is. It works fine but....
My MacBook came from Discount MacIntosh Depot encrypted so I had to have it unencrypted.  The support help never seemed to directly address my concerns after a couple of emails and their email address was a bunch of letters that didn't seem to make sense, although they did respond promptly.

The case had numerous deep scratches on the lid.

It seems to work perfectly.
This was for my grandson starting high school. This lap top far exceeded his expectations. He was able to download his text books and is great for scheduling his class's and assignments.
This computer was older than I thought and my granddaughter was not able to do some of the things she wanted to.  We were not able to upgrade it so we returned it.
It is a very good product to buy.
I bought it for my wife's small selling business.  It Is simple, It is cheaper, and it does the job.  It is still a good quality inexpensive product.  I was lucky that I found a good amazon seller, that is also a pc technician.  I bought it with a new electric cable, and the seller were open to receive it in return, if I didn't like it.
This laptop is a very nice looking and it is nicely keyboard features and screen of 14 inches screen and I wanted it to said to thanks you for giving it to me of this excellent Apple IBook Mac Laptop and I love it but It's a small screen and it's very worth it of my times and it's a very comfortable a little bit laptop... And This is my first time to getting it a Apple Computers and I have it right now is 2 or 3 a different Laptop so far is Compaq, Toshiba, HP Pro Desktop, and this one Apple Computers :) and I'm a very happy with my product it right now..

Other hands is that, and I am now going to using it on this Apple Mac a very nice ways to making it sure is that I don't wanted it to acting like it a very crazy to be around with it.
I will recommend it you have to buy it on this Apple IBook G4 Laptop and it's a very worth it and my money etc. and I wanted it to said to Thanks you for the Amazon and in the Sellers... You're guys rocks!!!
I received my purchase in a matter of 2-3 days! Have not had any technical difficulties and was amazed that computer came with microsoft office installed right along with some other basic interesting installments. No complaints here!!!
I HAVE TWO PCS THAT ALWAYS  G IVE ME PROBLEMS......WITH THE iBOOK I ALWAYS  CAN BE SURE OF GETTING ON LINE WITHOUT HAVING TO WAIT TO DOWNLOAD OR CORRECT SOME PROBLEM
I'd have been beside myself happy if the internet worked faster than it does. With that exception, I love this computer. I bought it for myself so I could write reports. Though my last two computers were not apple, I was raised and used to apple computers nonetheless. I haven't used one though, in many years. However, despite all that time, I eased right back into the comfort of using an apple as if no time had passed at all. It actually felt like coming home.  Anyone who has grown accustomed to working on an apple computer knows exactly how that feels. Regardless of how far they've come, the basics are all there in this ibook. It's very comfortable to work on. All apples are, as I say, are idiot-friendly, that even a monkey could use them. If you're looking for comfort, ease, a wide variety of necessary and extra programs, and versatility for a very low price, you've found it in this ibook. Love it!
Not very good. Too old to used Firefox, google chrome. Too slow to run youtube. Not the sellers fault, it's just if you buy an Apple computer for under $200, you get what you pay for.
It's OK for an older MacBook if you don't need all the bells and whistles. It didn't have a camera and the keyboard was older.
I like this product, but it is newer and there are some issues with the laptop when you close it, it doesn't close properly. There is a fairly large gap when it's closed. It also wasn't updated at all and cannot store the time or date. I have to put it in everyday when I use it. Overall it's just okay. It's an older laptop, so I guess you get what you get. I would suggest the sellers to others though, they were great and send a card in case of any problems.
I read all the reviews before purchasing the Apple iBook Laptop.  The Apple computer company shipped my computer quickly and was securely packaged for shipping.  I received the computer which was already setup for easy plug and go.  I have since purchased 2 more computers from the Apple computer company because the computers look new and works like a charm.  Very happy will the 3 computers I purchased.
Love my laptop it comes everywhere with me. Also, it suits my needs for instructing an online class. Cool purchase.
I've always used Windows, but wanted to check out a Mac, to see how I like them. Since I'm a complete novice, or was, I purchased this used iBook mainly to check it out and learn how Apple works differently than Windows. Granted, it is an old machine, but did teach me things about the Mac OS. So, when I found out my stepdad was getting the newest MacBook, I jumped at the chance when he asked if I wanted the MacBook he'd been using. I think I've used my Windows laptop a handful of times since. Love the Mac and this iBook really helped me start learning, before I got the MacBook Pro.
Received in time and well packed. Combination of Apple quality and convenience of pre-loaded MS Office for small price. Little heavy compare to new models. Can run skype without image, perfect screen quality. Only minus - sometimes stops internet, when searching in U-tube, Yahoo, sometimes Google too - I guess, mostly because of advertisement.
At nearly the 1 GHz speed and with identical specs, this is a great value.  Also, while not mentioned here, this does include all the latest software included with more recent, faster models, including  iLife (includes iTunes, iPhoto, iMovie, iDVD, GarageBand), AppleWorks, Mac OS X Panther, Quicken 2004 for Mac, World Book 2004 Edition, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4, and Deimos Rising.  The hardware is identical to more recent, faster models as well.  Aside from these notes, I can say I'm very impressed with the Mac experience, as this is my first Mac.  The quality of the design of the hardware and software is unending and flawless.  This is a great, lightweight (7.9 lbs) laptop for using to create documents or surf wirelessly.  I highly recommend adding the Airport Extreme card, not included.
This little beauty came into my life around Christmas, and she and I have been inseparable since then.  I ordered it directly from the Apple Store Online, and I had it maxed out on RAM, and had the optional 60G hard drive installed.  I love the processor speed, immense capability, and versatility.  The screen size makes it a suitable replacement for a desktop computer.
I do everything on this computer: word-processing, spreadsheets, music transcription, photo editing, Internet communications, audio editing, and managing my music collection.  I have Office X, Sibelius, and  iLife 2004. I run iTunes in the background, write a report integrating Excel and Word, plus can have all my pictures handy on iPhoto.  I can have five or six applications running at the same time (not including iChat and MSN Messenger, which are ALWAYS running), and the processor doesn't even hiccup.  I use an iPod 40G as an external hard drive (not to mention all dem kewl tunes!), and have a Canon PowerShot A80 digital camera, and an iMic audio converter.  Add to that an AirPort driven wireless network and a laser printer, and you have an ultra-powerful home office for any kind of occupation, from music composition, culinary research, to communications-based businesses.
Although larger and heavier than the 12" iBook, I believe the 14" screen is definitely worth the extra weight and price.  If you get it, the wireless card (AirPort Extreme) is a must.  The optional built-in Bluetooth module is nice, especially if you have a compatible PDA or cell phone.
I didn't realize I would love owning a laptop.  Until I met this one.
The iBook G4 is a GREAT laptop, perfect for-- just about everything. I only didn't like some things in it, like it only having an Apple MINI DVI video out, no PCI slot and it does not have the extensive amount of software that you can use with windows.
PROS:
Just 5.9 pounds for a 14.1" laptop
GREAT design
2 usb 2.0, firewire
802.11g (optional airport extreme card)
UP TO 6 HOURS of battery life! That's amazing
Combo drive CD-RW & DVD-ROM
40 GB, Speedy processor (933 MHZ) & LOTS more!
CONS:
does NOT come with bluetooth & airport card (sold optional)
no PCI slot :(
speakers are small, and are not that loud
i can't find another bad thing about it!!
This is the best laptop I've ever owned. That's all I have to say about that.
The iBook, Apple's "consumer" portable (a consumer simply being an everyday user), really has it all now: a very speedy processor, great graphics, great design (it took a few years for them to perfect this white beauty), great features (a lazy way of saying "All the other things on the machine I forgot to mention"), and most importantly, a great price.
Ever since the iBook went G4, the machine took on a whole transformation. It is no longer lacking in the processor department and thus is a very "well-rounded" laptop.
As for the machine itself, it's great. The entire laptop is white, crisp white (a mixed blessing...it's elegant, but very, very hard not to dirty it), and the overall design is great. Everything is ergonomical and compact: the little latch to close the iBook stays hidden on the top, but then magically appears as you close it. (Gotta love Apple's design team for those little things!) The keyboard, unlike other models, isn't "spongy."In fact, it is rather sturdy for a laptop keyboard. It is stationed to a strong metal backboard and if you take the keyboard and backboard off, you will see a slot for an Airport Extreme card (card that enables wireless internet). No more PC "NIT" cards protruding from the sides, everything is on the inside. The top of the computer has a translucent Apple logo that glows when you are computing in the dark. The trackpad is large and precise, and the button (Windows users, beware: no "Left-clicking" in the Mac world, only "Command clicking"!) is large and responsive.
Battery life is excellent, I get an average of 5 hours with normal use. The charger has a light indicating the level of charge so you know when the 'book is charged (green for charged, amber for charging) without turning it on or waking it from its "Sleep" mode. Panther, the latest version of Mac OS X (10.3), is stunning, powerful, and reliable in its own right (go ahead and check out those reviews or Jaguar's reviews, the previous OS X version.) I don't want to go into the benefits of its UNIX core, just trust me that it is stable. The "iLife" set of software is one that really revolutionized the Apple world, after OS X, software-wise. It's all here: iTunes (store, burn, and buy music in one easy-to-use program), iPhoto (organize, burn, share, print, edit, email, and more with a plug-and-play friendly piece of software), iMovie (for editing, storing, and organizing your DV movies), but no iDVD...no DVD burner (but you can buy an external one.) Some other good programs that supplement your iLife are Mail, Appleworks, iChat, iCal, etc. It comes with World Book 2003, Quicken, and a few others.
It's fast. CD's burn with one click. My iPod (a great addition to this for music lovers) loads with one slide of a Firewire cable (literally.) Safari has built-in pop-up control (never has a single pop-up existed here.) Games (only the Sims so far) load and play flawlessly. DVD watching is pristine. USB 2.0 and Firewire (a BIG plus for external hard drives) work at top speed. No bugs, no crashes, no viruses. This machine was engineered to have the software and hardware be integrated. Have a problem? You won't be told to call a different company. You will always have one number to call, and they can't transfer you (since they make the hardware and software)
What more is there to say? I love my iBook! It's light, user friendly, and works like a dream. Quick! Go order one. You'll be in for a treat.
I have never ordered a used electronic device before and so far I am very pleased with my purchase.
My Ibook came in 1 day earlier than expected which for me was perfect considering hurricane Sandy was going to hit the east today and I needed more devices to play movies on.. I did not give this a 5 star rating only because the processer is not intel so forget streaming netflix to this device but thats small peanuts to me.. Enjoy your purchase
The Ibook's software is too old to fully enjoy Internet and my computer and did not live to my expectations. I cannot watch movies, cannot download anything. I only can connect to my email box, and listen to music. Connecting to Skype will only give me the old version of Skype.
I've been using and defending PCs for a long, long time! Ever since I got in front of a computer (about 20 years ago), all I've worked with were PCs. And I stubbornly kept defending PCs and disregarding Macs as thought they were inferior. As of late, however, I've been using UNIX quite a bit and knowing the strengths of all *IX OS's I knew I wanted a *IX compatible laptop. Well, alas! Apple came with Panther and I was sold! I bought this laptop through my university's Apple store and got it "souped-up" and I tell you with confidence that this is the *best* laptop I've ever owned! The weight is lower than most competitors' comparable laptops. The power of Panther is outstanding. I feel confident recommending this laptop to anyone without any reservations. Apple is giving consumers, for the first time, a TRUE alternative to MS Windows' hegemony. Some of you who have been around computers might read the title of this post and giggle for that is what people were saying back in the mid-80s and never became a reality (at least not for the consumer as evidenced by the market share apple holds). But I think with this laptop and Panther Apple has made a believer out of me. Very solid, good-lloking, powerful laptop.
I bought my iBook and for three days was happy as a clam. On the third day my hard drive completely failed. This was confirmed by the support team at the game development company where I work. The iBook was sent to a service center where they tried to charge me 50 dollars to look at it. I refused and the iBook sat unlooked at for three more days until finally under pressure from both me and the support team, the performed the five minute hard drive diagnosis and pronouced it dead. Then the ordered a new hard disk and told me it would be a week until it arrived.  So far my iBook experience has been
1)defective product
2)attempt to charge for repair of product
3)late diagnosis
4)late repair
If you're thinking about getting a mac, get a powerbook. They're 2cnd generation and won't have nearly as many quality issues as the iBooks. Apple always tries to fix computers, never replace them.  Dig around and you'll find a lot of people with iBooks and failed hard disks on forums. If I had a chance to do it again, I wouldn't have bought this computer. I'd have got the 12 inch powerbook instead
Although Apple markets this laptop as though it's an entry level laptop for casual users, I can tell you that from my experience it's plenty powerful enough for the road warrior as well.  Unless you have money to burn or some very good reason to go for the Powerbook, I suggest you save $1,000 and buy the iBook. The only downside to ordering from Amazon is that you can't get one with the internal Bluetooth module.  This was an issue for me because I have a Bluetooth enabled phone and mouse, so I ordered direct from Apple.
The 1 GHz processor and maximum RAM provide lightening fast boot-up and application loading.  Add the Airport Extreme card and you can surf the web from hotspots all over the country.
Ok, I know you have read time and again about making "the Switch" to which most just shake their heads. Me I'm sold! I got the ibook over the powerbook due to the fact that 1) I am not a graphic designer, 2) the battery life, 3) the price, and 4) I didn't like squinting at the 12" screen. The battery life on the 14" is awesome! It is pretty true to the advertising of 6 hrs, even if you are running airport extreem and playing itoons as you surf the web as I am right now. The battery life dipps a little when you are watching DVDs, or playing a game, but then again that's because you are crunching some serious graphical goodness due to the ati card. Over all, I say it's a great buy for the money! I will recommend to everyone to max out the ram though, a must with OSX. If you are looking for a great laptop that just works and runs forever GET THIS ibook.
I give this laptop a rating of 5 because it run good out of the box. have to other laptop this one run the best no problems at all. very good wireless card can go outside and still pick up signal. screen like my hp very high resolution. battery last long. good for work. speed amost the same as my dell p4 3.2ht, dell beat by a few points in the benchmark test.
but didn't get it for speed. drive could have been better, had to put more ram. but it a very good laptop if you are taken it to work or on the go.
This is the first ThinkPad I bought for myself, the other three that I have been used in the past eight years were provided by the company I worked for.

Decision making was easy:

1. Overall lowest cost: after deducted the costs for 3-year warranty, high resolution LCD screen, Windows XP Pro, slim and light-weight design and quality material.

2. Proven reliability: this means there won't be extra costs to burden my 3-year ownership.

3. Excellent technical support (I called IBM technical support once in August, one month after I got T41, and was surprised that the tech. support rep. picked up the phone right the way and guided me step by step to go through the problem I had. They even followed up with a call to confirm the problem has been solved!

Yes, I am more than happy to recommend IBM ThinkPad T41 (2379DJU) to you. However, the best buy is with $100 rebate from Amazon.
I bought this New T41 2 months ago, Product is awesome, but after 6 weeks of use, the hard disk crashed, and when i called up IBM, they said that they would replace the hard disk with a new one, and the data from the old one cannot be restored. Lost all my data. So, if ur planning to buy it, I would suggest u to buy an external data storage.
I researched for 6 months before choosing this IBM.  Great value, solid notebook.  Love the keyboard and the access IBM help.  I have called tech support for information and help with software installations and driver updates and they were very good and patient with all my detailed questions.  This is important to me... to have good tech support available. This T41 comes with a 3 year warranty.

IBM's website has excellent support.  I love the automated stuff where it analyzes your computer and tells you what updates you need.  Sometimes their driver upgrades are more for the IT person. But, just download their software installer and it works great.  However, you must focus...if you want to understand what you have downloaded.  Not totally for the novice. Tech support walked me thru it once and I was on my way.

So far so good after only a month, the T41 rocks!  Particularly the higher-end graphics card, glad I went for that.  I can tell the difference when comparing with my desktop LCD.

The CD burner works well and I use Nero 6.  I had been using a 4x burner on my desktop and this one writes at 24x...what a difference.

If you are contemplating a notebook, consider this one.  Pay the extra bucks and go with IBM...very glad I did!
Great Christmas present for son. He will love it. This product was inexpensive and works great. Thank you so much.
Even though this is an older model computer, it works great will up to date software. It is smaller than a regular laptop and I even find myself using it more because of the convience.
Oh, Thinkpad, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways!

I have never had a refurbished machine, so I was wary about glitches and bugs--but when my computer arrived, all my fears were laid to rest. This machine is huge, heavy, and STURDY AS BALLS. This is NOT a hoity-hoity little Macbook air that you're going to be afraid of breaking if you look crossways at it. This, my friends, is a F$#@ing Thinkpad. This guy eats 5 dozen eggs for breakfast. He can lift up a bench with three buxom lasses on it. He uses antlers in all of his decorating. Get the picture? Good.

He is HEAVY and HUGE and I have named mine Moose.

Now, granted, this is not a guy you can watch movies on, or play games on. This is definitely a computer for writing and surfing the web and basics like that. He CAN stream pandora or another music service, but tends to skip sometimes if you're doing anything else. He has a bit of trouble with flash-heavy webpages, but a good flashblocker add-on can help him with that. Budget your programs with him, don't ask him to do too much. I usually limit myself to a chat program (and I use Trillian 3.1 and AIM 5.9), Word, and Chrome. Definitely use the most streamlined versions of things on this guy, and he'll do you fine.

Of course, there is the little matter of you being able to add space, speed, and so on with him. Thinkpads are probably the best kind of machine for upgrading. He's got space for more inside his casing, which is more than you can say for newer machines, that are just meant to be thrown out after a year.

Another bonus is the full-size keyboard, the two types of mouse (a touchpad and the pointing stick, the latter of which has a middle button which I'm sure does SOMETHING but I don't know what), the very sturdy mouse-buttons (they're loud but push down satisfyingly), the status lights at the bottom of the monitor, and the little white LED on the top of the monitor, that illuminates the keyboard in the dark. There are also page forward and page back buttons on either side of the up key.

I would say that if you're a writer in need of a laptop that'll survive the long haul, or if you're someone who appreciates a machine that will last you years instead of months, get this. Ffs there's a review in here from someone who's had their machine for five years!

This guy won't steer you wrong, people.
First unit wouldn't read DVD disks. It was replaced courteously, and the new laptop works fine. Also,it runs XP (vs 98 on the first one).  I ran CCleaner, which cleaned out a lot of old junk, and now it runs fast. Would definitely recommend, and a good value for the money.
i bought this for my kids and traveling and paid around 150 give some take some.but i would not buy from this company ever again. YES its refurbished but i thought that also ment the battery would stay charged.it don't the only way it works is plugged in the wall outlet all the time.and i got no paperwork(company# or info on laptop) from company on anything with it.dont get me wrong but it dos work when its plugged in.notto pleased cause i got to buy a battery.buy the time im done i should of bought new.
nice laptop for the money, clean works well.  They upgraded it with a new 160 GB hard drive, and 2 GB of memory for the same price.  Fast delivery.
I like IBM and for the price this one will do more than what I will be asking of it.
(a) Best keyboard ever made for laptops, (b) Decent speed, runs Office 2007 O.k., (c) Acceptable graphics (ATI 7500) or good graphics (ATI 9000 / 9600 / FireGL, the latter 2 can play Far Cry 1.0), (d) Thinklight is very useful on overseas plane flights, (e) fits perfectly on all airplane tray tables, (f) Outstanding battery life with CD-battery + 9-cell (5-6 hrs if you dim the screen), (g) It actually sleeps and wakes up properly unlike 50% of all laptops, and (h) You can just grab it and run to a conference room, yanking it out of the minidock, and it will sleep properly, unlike newer (T60, T400) machines where you have to hit a key first !!

DONT buy anything with less than 1.8 Ghz processor as the 1.7 Ghz and lower have a smaller cache(2MB vs 3MB) and are about 33% slower.

I have used about 4x of these machines at work over the past 6 years.  I just got my 4th machine so each machine lasts about 2 years.  The typical failure is a really bad/sticky key (1st), a failure of some buttons on the synaptics track pad (2nd), a hard drive failure (3rd), or a failure of the power-port male plug, making it difficult (but not impossible) to charge the unit.  With the exception of the hard drive failure, NONE of the failures were catastrophic "I cannot do any work right now" type of failures, so the system is robust.

The IBM repair manual is fantastic so I buy new parts on ebay and repair it myself.  I've replaced hinges(very hard), screens(very hard), keyboard(easy), touchpad(easy), fans(medium - you need CPU paste).  The keyboard in particular takes 120 seconds to replace as it's just 5 screws and it pops out.
Back in 2004 I did quite a bit of research before settling on a T41 (from newegg.com).  I got more RAM for 768M total.  Over four years later it is still going very strong.

Great keyboard, light (even today), thin (even today), fairly fast, well-built screen tilting mechanism.  Quiet, doesn't heat up too much.

If you're a vi user, you probably won't like the position of the Escape key (you can remap it to F1).

It took about three years for the battery to become unusable (I recently got a new one for about[...]).

The built-in wireless antenna stopped working and I got a new one from Lenovo support (for free, it was still under the 3-year warranty), but the old one fixed itself as soon as the replacement arrived and has been working now for a few years since.

The left 25% of the space bar don't produce a space when pressed --- started happening after around three years.

The left button on the lower mouse controls stopped working --- started happening after four years.

I've been using a Macbook Pro for work, and every time I open the T41 now, it's such a relief to be able to tilt the screen as far back as I want.
I've had a T-41 for about two years.  It's been back to IBM three times for new motherboards when the video went out.  It's been back once for a new wireless card.  A second wireless card is coming via delivery service as I type.  This time I get to put it in.

I've had several Thinkpads and love their functionality.  IBM's service people are friendly and helpful.  The problem is that I'm getting to know the guys in Atlanta way too well.

I asked IBM to replace this T-41 as a lemon. They responded by giving me an extra year of warranty.  That was nice, but every time this thing goes down, it costs me lost time, and for someone who is self employed that is a bad thing.
I got my vaio about a year back to replace an aging desktop. In about 6 months, a couple of keys came off but sony support replaced those immediately.

I'e had some problems wiht the operating system- for instance, internet explorer will not show some images on websites. Its irritating (is it SP2? I don't know). ALso, the beautiful case gets scratched easily adn the screen seems very delicate- I don't carry it around too much and I am afraid to.

But otherwise it is a great little machine which I can take around and use anywhere in the house. Very pretty, very smart only thing is needs more strength.
I bought my SONY VAIO V505EX to write my disertation.

The good news:  It is FAST and reliable. I can easily sync with my home and work computers using Briefcase so my data on all three computers is always up to date. As mentioned in other reviews, downloads from sites such as iTunes are speedy and accurate. I love that the connections are on the sides instead of the back. This allows me to keep my "baby" in a zippered sleeve that I don't have to remove to plug it in or use the USB ports. Most other brands have their connections on the back and it is awkward to hook up if you prefer to keep a cover or sleeve on the machine. The screen resolution is brilliant if tilted at just the right angle. I have never been a fan of touch pads, and in fact purchased a small portable USB mouse when I purchsed the computer. The touch pad is so "true" and easy to use, that the mouse now stays in my briefcase unused.

The "not so good" news:  My machine came with a multimedia package that included a partitioned hard drive. This was NOT workable for me as my data and research (including a library of PDF files) needed to be easily accessbile. I did not like having to switch drives or go to special lengths to make sure I was not overloading the smaller partition (20 GB). When I contacted Sony, they told me that if I remove the partitions, I could no longer use their support. I stewed over this for awhile and then opted to reformat the entire drive and take the risk. I am much happier with one 60GB hard drive. The only other problem I have is with the keyboard. I have read in other reviews that the keyboard is great so I am not sure if this is just "me" or if others have this problem. They keys are nice and tight, but have edges that help you make sure you are not "drifting" to a neighboring key...however, the shift key is only one key instead of a double key. Thus I am constantly hitting "Page Up" when I mean to shift and typing in the wrong place. Additionally, if I accidentally touch the key pad when this happens (a sleeve brushes it, etc.), I end up selecting (and often deleting) a whole page of data. I have caught this each time and am able to use the "undo" function to retrieve my info, but it is annoying. I have been trying to review and revise my own keyboarding habits to overcome this problem, but so far without much luck. For now, I make sure I glance at the screen (not as easy when taking notes in a class or meeting) to make sure I am in the right place.

Overall, I couldn't be happier (with minor exceptions) with this tiny, light, and efficient machine. I recommend it to anyone who needs portability, speed and reliability. Perhaps an external keyboard when not on the road would make it almost perfect!
This is my third Vaio laptop since 1999 and my wife has one also, plus two Vaio desktops, so you can tell we like this brand. I like my PCG-V505 for several things, like the speed and the built in DVD writer, which seems very fast. It is great to use data DVDs for backup and ripping music CDs into iTunes is very swift.

But the  PCG-V505 series has two minor issues for me--the keyboard keys have tight edges that can catch on fingernails and the case scrathes easily as one other reviewer indicated--and a major problem for anyone with XP and anything over 512MB of RAM. There is a known bug in XP that can prevent hibernation in machines with 1 gigabyte or more of RAM.

Hibernation is essential for a laptop because the hard drives in laptops are susceptible to heat damage. The longer they run in a high temeprature laptopn case, the sooner they die (I think I have replaced enough hard drives in laptops, including Vaois to make this claim, and if you read the tech lit, this is a well-documented phenomemon). So if the laptop won't hibernate you either have to shutdown as you travel between locations or it is liable to come on, in your bag, during travel, resulting in damaging 'hot briefcase' syndrome.

I treated myself to 2 gigabytes of factory-installed RAM in my machine and boy am I regretting it. Performance is great, I can run a ton of apps at once, which is how I like to work, but no hibernation. Sony support told me XP SP 2 would fix this (it is listed on the fixes that Microsoft claimed). But SP2 did not fix it and the thing that bothers me is Sony knew of the problem when they sold me the machine. Tech support at Sony was not at all helpful -- "rebuild the machine from scratch then add one app at a time, test, and then add another." Since the problem only appears after about 24 hours of use, and I can't go without some apps for several days, this was not a good fix.

Microsoft support was more helpful and is still working with me on it. But I am now inclined to take out the extra RAM and sell it (at a loss) defaulting back to the standard 512MB. My advice to buyers, test the keyboard yourself, and skip the extra RAM.

I've had my Vaio PCG-V505EX for a year now, and I haven't had any problems yet.  It's light so I can carry it under one arm easily.  It withstands light shaking and bumping, so it's not too fragile. I bring it everywhere!

Keyboard feels great, screen is nice and bright.  Only thing is I found out about Giga Pocket, which this particular model doesn't have.  I would love to be able to watch TV from my laptop and record TV shows...
I love sony vaio's. I have had this v505ex for a couple of weeks and love it. It is so fast, light. The screen is huge and the keyboard is great. It has a great warranty and sony backs everything.
I have an PCG-V505ECP. The touchpad was a little bit confusing in the beginning but after I read the online manual the mistery is solved. The touchpad actually work both as mouse and scroll wheel. When you slide your finger along the right side of the pad, it activates the scrolling mode. This is configurable if you don't like it, although I agree they probably should put some hint (such as a color strip) on the touchpad so people will aware of it at the first place. The wireless 802.11b works fine for me. I've use it for only a few days but I like it a lot. The battery life almost as good as they described (maximum 6 hours if you don't use any power-consuming features). Also it comes with the support of Java by default.  The only thing bothers me is that there are too many trial software (AOL, MS Office 2003 60-day trial) so I need to spend one hour to uninstall them.
Just got this Notebook for 3 days. It has problems maintaining it's wireless connection. I tried it on 2 different wireless access points (Netgear and SkyHawk) and Vaio drops the connection every 5 mins. I'm literally 4 feet from my access point, and it still drops. All my other wireless connection works fine and the Dell Notebook works fine. I called Vaio Support and they're useless. They first said that my warranty expired??? and then proceed to say that I purchased it from an unauthorized seller (Amazon). After I resolved that issue, they start to blame the wireless access point. That's a total BS, because my other wireless devices would be affected if it was the access point. Also, I used the Vaio on 2 access points! How can that happen to 2 different access points???
Aside from being small, light weight, excellent battery life, and slick design; this one sucks without the support. I will be returning mine back to Amazon and stick with Dell. They offer better support and quality. I strongly recommend another small notebook and avoid Sony!!!
I HAD THIS FOR ABOUT 2 MONTHS NOW. I AM IMPRESS WITH THE ATI RADEON GRAPHICS CARD AS IT PLAYS VARIOUS 3D GAMES. SO FAR I LOADED NEED 4 SPEED UNDERGROUND, AND FREEDOM FIGHTERS, AND IT PLAYS GREAT.  BE FOREWARN; RUNNING A GAME ON CD REQUIRES LOTS OF POWER SO DONT EXPECT THE SAME PERFORMANCE ON BATTERIES.
I HAD PROBLEMS WITH ERROR MESSAGES POPPING UP REGARDING THE SONY MEDIA SERVER.  TECH SUPPORT HELP CORRECT THOSE PROBLEMS
OVERALL, ITS A GREAT CENTRINO MULTIMEDIA/BUSINESS LAPTOP, ALL PROGRAMS WORK FAST AND THE SYSTEM SEEMS VERY STABLE.
SO AFTER TWO MONTHS.. NOTHINS CRASHED YET!!! GREAT LIL MACHINE.. ENOUGH KEYBOARD SPACE.. AND VERY FAST! ONLY NEGATIVE... IS THE 2 X 256MB MEMORY THAT IT COMES WITH INSTEAD OF JUST 1 512MB! THOSE SONY EXECS ALWAYS TRYING TO MAKE MONEY FROM US!
Bought the Sony so I wouldn't break my shoulders on trips but found that the small size is only one of it's many virtures.
The screen, even though small, is extremely bright, clear and accurate and is wonderful to use.  The built in WiFi card is just terrific for absent minded travelers like myself; no need to remember to carry an PCMCIA card and nothing to break when stuffing the PC into a carry bag running for the airport gate.  Battery life is absolutley amazing and there is very little heat that is produced from this laptop.  Having a cd/dvd drive on such a little unit is a definate plus, though upgrading it seems impossible.  I always thought that not having a cd/dvd drive would be ok, but I find I use it more often than I thought.
There is one thing on this laptop I would change.  The little keyboard, in it of itself, is just fine, but the right hand shift key is just not placed correctly and should be double wide like the left hand one.  Most often, when one goes to shift, the up arrow key is hit which causes lots of cut and pasting when trying to complete a document or spreadsheet in an hurry.
It has some neat features as well, that I really don't use.  The video camera is a nice feature, but for the life of me, I have no idea what to use it for.  Really more to impress your freinds than anything else.
Overall, the lightweightness, bright screen, long battery life, and cd/dvd drive for watching movies on airplanes when you don't want to do any more work, really makes this one of the best laptops on the market today.
Highly recommended.
I just bought this Laptop from a CompUSA, they were the only store to actually have one on display, the unknowledgeable staff at Best Buys said that this model didn't even exist!
I am a student and wanted something with wireless connectivity, portability, and very small/lightweight.  This laptop met all those requirements.  I use my Treo 600 phone/PDA with PDA net and a USB cable to access the wireless internet when I'm away from home and I a Linksys wireless-G router with Speedbooster at home.  I also have cable modem access at home.  The laptop immediately recognized my home network with no adjustments needed.  Web access was really fast.  If I am surfing the web I will get 3.5 hrs. battery life using the standard battery that came with it.  I'm thinking about buying the double capacity battery that's available, (lists at $349 but you get 20% off when you register the laptop.)
It's also very quiet and doesn't get "hot", just very warm.  Yes, the keyboard is a little small for my hands, but I just type a little slower and check for accuracy more often.
I read all the reviews here before buying.  I also considered the Z series, but seeing the X-brite screen on this TR laptop really made me want this one.  The screen is awesome. Very crisp, clear and bright.
Yeah, the warranty isn't so great, but I bought a 2 yr. warranty through CompUSA for $349 that covers everything, even the screen.
If anybody has any questions about this laptop, I highly recommend it and you can e-mail me your questions at:
JJS070470@cox.net.
Thanks!
Never trust Sony laptops, you lose functionality if you ever make the mistake of upgrading and the laptop is pretty much useless.
i am in love with my new vaio. I was hesitant to choose between the Z1 vaio or TR3A for a long time and finally decided cause of the lighter weight and the built in camera.  I bought a wireless router and i am video chatting with my friends all over the world lying in my bed.
Pros: lightweight, whoever sees it with you see that you have a style, long battery , relativly fast performance with pics and videos , very good keyboard i can type faster on it than my pc and doesnt tire my hands , sony picture and vidosoftware is great, the built in cam gives you the freedom t o re cord a meeting easily what i often do since ..in fact that is why i shoose this model, excelent screen quality , if you buy it you will be simply happy with it, but don't forget this is a second notebook
Cons: if you are not a mediaperson like me and rather wanna use it for business like word, office ..i wouldnt suggest it cause this screen is too small for a long use with document.  and if you are not using the built in mic which has excelent qualty and cam which is good for the net, i would rather suggest an asu with 12 screen, or the Z1 modell from sony which has 14 screen and mic too and bigger processor. For some reason though Cnet has bad revews on that modellbut if the little heavier weight doesnt disturb you and don't need built in cam i might go with that .And important if you do not see well close choose a modell with bigger screen cause with this one you have to be a bit shortsited that i am though..lol..
SUmming it up i love my vaio.
I have the PCG-TR3AP, which is the "loaded" version of the unit.  I had a bad experience with a G4 12" (burned, long story) I decided to leave apple for good.  I was hesitant because I did not know if I would like to go smaller screen size (10.6".)  I have to admit, I am amazed by the so-called XBRITE screen, never seen such clear picture and that from every angle.  It is so good that one hardly realizes the smaller size.
The unit is very light and easier to carry around than the 12" units, yet it includes all the bells and whistles; like cd burner (even dvd burner in my case) wireless connection is a great plus.  You can manually turn it on and off saving battery power.
The overall battery use is great thanks to centrino and thanks to the fact that you can fine-tune the screen properties to extend battery life.  In addition I purchased the larger battery as well, which gave me almost double the original battery time.
Overall, the unit is sturdy and the integrated camera is a nice gadget that is useful, especially considering that video conference is becoming more available every day.
The only thing my unit is missing is Bluetooth (I can't lie, I am disappointed), but you can buy a d-link usb dongle for 35$.  The memorystick slot is very useful if you are using other sony products. Another issue I was not very found of was the fact, that sony does not send you any software/cd's, so a word of advise as soon as you take the thing out of the box, following the instruction make the system restore cd's they recommend.
My experience with the keyboard is very good as well.  It took only couple of hours to get used to the 17mm keys, one thing I am missing is the larger shift key on the right-hand side.
This is not a low-budget item, there are laptops on the market for 800$, this clearly is more expensive, but you get what you pay for.  I travel a lot and I appreciate the capabilities of this laptop especially since it is delivered in such a small package with little or no compromises.  So if you are looking at this item, make sure to count the extras that you would have to add to another laptop to make it do all the things this one does.
Although the look of a computer is one of the least important, admittedly, it is very attractive and a discussion piece no matter where you go.
I do not want to talk about the harddrive size and memory since this will be different in different models.
Pros:
Size
Display
Integrated CDRW/DVD(RW)
Integrated Wifi
Integrated Camera (Still/Video/Webcam)
Centrino (low voltage)
Battery life
MagicGate Memorystick slot
The TOuchpad has special sections that let you add extra functionality
Cons:
No restore cd's
No Bluetooth (some models do include Bluetooth)
I throw my vaio in my bag everyday (I do have a case for it!!).  It's fantastic!
I haven't had the problems with the screen that others have had.  In fact I went and looked at this computer at a local national chain and tried to damage the screen...and I couldn't.  I am extremely impressed with the quality and all the bells and whistles this computer comes with.  My coworkers are very jealous and now think I make tons more money than they do.
The only draw back that annoyed me with this computer, and maybe this is a given with a new computer, but it didn't come with Microsoft Word, Exel, Access or Powerpoint.  I bought this with the idea of using on a train and working in a word processing document(my commute is 1.5 hrs. door to door) and my first day I was very annoyed with this...I couldn't do anything but listen to music!  I fortunately had access to an old version of Office '97 so I didn't have to pay hundreds of additional dollars for programs that I assumed would have been already installed.  Maybe it's because I'm the furthest from a computer geek (unfortunately), but I really thought if I spent this much money I would have the programs I needed...and bought the laptop for.
With this being said, I really can't fault the laptop for my ignorance, but I felt it was something I should share.  Now that I have it, though, I really do love it!  I recommend this laptop to anyone who has to carry a computer with them everyday (it's very, very light), very fast and very effective.
I bought it here at Amazon after reading the reviews previously reported and I'm very happy I did.  This computer is wonderful.  I didn't like the lack of "Word" but maybe more knowledgable people know about this.  I would recommend this to a friend or my mom!!
This is the second VAIO mini I've bought -- the other being the C1XS Picturebook -- and I love them both. The size and features on the TR3AP2 are incredible. I just have one warning: be sure to back up the hard drive often. I've grown complacent over the past 20 years because I've never lost a hard-drive or its contents. This VAIO's hard-drive crapped out suddenly after only 4 months. Calling customer support, though, was fine. They sent me a FedEx box the next day and will even send me back the hard-drive so I can try to get my data off it from some hard-drive reclamation expert.
I looked around quite a bit before settling on the VAIO TR3. I am more than pleased with it and heartily recommend it. It is a perfect size for personal use in tight spaces. I use it on business travel and also when I take a break from  work, by going to the local coffee shop.

The letters on the keyboard are in a different kind of font and sometimes, if you look down at the keyboard, it can disorient you. Yes, the machine does get warm - but it is not a problem at all. This machine is jam packed with features, from the cd burner to the camera - which takes great still shots by swiveling the camera around.

I say - get this gem now.
I loved the whole idea of this light weight notebook and camera,

 but the screen is so vulnerable to even a slight touch that it is an anxiety producing nightmare.  I accidentally touched the corner of the screen while adjusting the cover.  My thumb print cost $724.00 to fix and Sony seems not to care.  I have had the machine 2 months.  There is no warning label on or around the screen and the margin of error is small. Unless you have money to spare I would not buy this computer.  I am now afraid to use it. Sony is aware of the problem but is not supporting the consumer. Caveat Emptor!
Like everyone else. I read the reviews, user's comments, checkout the stats, etc. about this laptop. Then finally put out the big $$$ to get it. There are alot of things to like about this computer like other owners have described. My only complain is about the battery. Sony's site and most folks in this column said that they can get 6 hours with a fully charge with the battery that comes with this laptop. But I only get about 3 - 3.5 hours max including using the "Maximum Battery Life" profile. I have put up some more $$$ to get the larger battery, still what I got is about 7 hrs or less. So where is the 8+ hours that other people have said ? I have been looking up and down in Sony's technical support site and Goolge but find nothing said if this long lasting battery claim is true. Does anyone have an actually experience with this battery claim ?
For work, I've primarily used ultrathin notebooks: the Sony R505 for a year and then the Toshiba R100 over the last 12 months. Here's what I look for:
> long battery life (for plane flights)
> minimal sacrifice of processing power, HD space, keyboard, other features
> painless wifi and ethernet access
> other cool, smart things I can showoff
This VAIO is great on a number of fronts:
1. INCLUDED battery is solid: 6 hrs for docs, powerpoint, etc, 3 hrs for a DVDs. Meets all my needs for coast-to-coast flights. Light as a book.
2. It works great as my primary computer. I do hook up to a full keyboard/monitor at the office, but I don't feel compromised on speed or functionality.
3. On the road, the is very usable. You might want to try it out, but I don't have an issue. The monitor is extremely clear and bright. They've included a ZOOM feature on the unit to make it easy to enlarge the screen image. Thoughtful, and it works very well.
4. WIFI switch works perfect. Have connected in coffeeshops, airports and the like. No issues. The Ethernet and dial-up jacks are well-postioned.
5. Monitor jack is on the side so it doesn't interfer with the screen being open. 2 USBs are on opposite sides for good reason. Generally, well laid out.
6. When you're working on your traytable on a plane, and the person in front of you leans back, your poor display doesn't get crushed because it's short enough not be compacted.
7. Other items: The camera is fun and useful if you use IM video. Well positioned for informal chatting. It includes DVD viewing software (which my other computer with a DVD drive didn't). My long-term experience with Sony laptops has been that they are very good, durable computers. I researched this unit and compared to other Toshiba, Dell and ThinkPad before the purchase, and after a month feel even more confident about the decision.
Some Cons
> Additional battery is overpriced. As usual, Sony makes the upcharge for another battery or larger capacity battery abusely expensive. Such a turnoff. Thankfully, you really don't need one with this model.
> The Screen IS smaller. Hey, you should know this going into it. Fine for word docs, email, ppts, some spreadsheet work, and DVDs (16x9 format), but if you do a lot of graphics work, it's going to feel tight.
Simply speaking.. this is the most coolest and sexiest thing I have ever had.. And it really make me feel good about my decision of buying tr3a when people just can't stop eyeing this babe..
PROS: Small size, Light weight, Best features including bright display, inbuilt cd-dvd drive, inbuilt webcam and mic, all possible slots including usb, flash card reader, magicdrive, wi-fi ready, better battery life. Keyboard is awesome, noiseless and soft like anything.
CONS: Gets hot (You have to handle it so that base gets exposed to a little air), Screen gets tinted with finger marks if touched (my friend has a compaq and he wipes it with bare fingers w/o problem), Screen is brighter when you are viewing right from front, not from side (unlike powerbook), speakers are really crappy and irritating. On top of all, its pricey.
I don't anymore need a girl friend now..:-)
Well, i'll make it simple and easy. I bought the Sony Tr3 from Bahrain (PCG-TR3). It is so handy when it comes to mobility.
Pros:
Long life battery lasted me 2 days with more than average use
with wireless turned on
Nice keyboard that makes no sound .. only problem is the right shift key which is no big deal
This Camera is so handy when it comes to taking pictures on the move of friends and to make online conference
Wireless is so handy when you are in a hot spot ...
The laptop is so lite weighted u can't even feel u are carrying anything!
Looks so trendy and all you get is amazed faces
I use it for university studies, designing my sites, ([...] / [...]) and i also use it for presentations and to get together with my friends studying abroad
cons
can't think of any
the only thing there are so many batter options which keeps u amazed and confused on which to choose
I recommend this laptop to anyone who appreciates the taste of technology and elegance at the same time
Trust me this is the ONE .. the only thing that may stand in your way is the over price .. but it is worth every penny/cent/fils .. just name it
Have a good day all
I've had a few Sony minicomputers - an early 505g, an SR-7, and now this TR3a.  Each revision of the mini keeps getting better for me:  The keyboard fits my hands well, and the screen, while small, is brilliant and sharp (and at 768x1280, it is ALMOST equivalent to my Powerbook 17"!)
It's fast, the battery life is very good (you really can get 5+ hours - I don't have to plug it in at work, putting it to sleep at lunch and meetings.  The Wireless G has very good range too, much better than my previous two Powerbooks...
Also, it looks FANTASTIC, and I've got nothing but awed looks at work - everyone wants to try it.  And it's remarkably light.
My only complaints:  The touchpad is dinky - you really need an external mouse for serious visio action - and it's just a LITTLE thicker than I wish...
In the end - if size and coolness are primary drivers for you (as they are for me), this is a no-brainer.  But if performance is what you need, the Z1 series might be better.  But the screen on the TR is much sharper than the Z1.
Highly Recommended by this geek.
I think the VAIO PCG-K13 is a great product from SONY. More importantly, its affordable. Here are some of the positives and negatives that I noticed:
POSITIVES:
 Fast 2.8 Ghz processor
 512MB DDR RAM
 533Mhz system bus.
All these make it a pretty high end laptop.
NEGATIVES: (These may be applicable to all K-series laptops)
1. 7.3lbs heavy
2. The AC power adapter is exteremly big and bulky. To make the laptop lighter and more attractive, SONY probably transferred some power supply components to the AC adapter.
3. 1024x768 is the maximum available screen resolution (I really wanted to be able to get 1280x1024 after paying $1350)
4. The XBRITE technology makes things worse in fluorescent/white light (like in the libraries) because the screen is very glossy. There's a huge amount of reflection from the LCD screen which reduces screen visibility.
5. NO PS/2 or SERIAL port. (only 3 USB ports. I would love to have a PS/2 port for an external mouse/keybd)
6. NO Floppy drive (I personally care less about this though)
This laptop has the best screen of any I have seen, clarity and brightness are unreal. Super fast 2.8 Pent 4, memory stick slot and great design. Highly recommend.
Some of these reviewers need to educate themselves before taking action.
The reviewer who cleaned their system before upgrading to Windows XP professional: why not use the upgrade version of XP professional instead?  The result is the same and costs less.
As far as the drivers for the system, all the orignal drivers are readily available for download on Sony's support website.
Look and learn!!!
I've owned this machine for three weeks now, and I have some mixed feelings.
I need this for work, but for my personal use, give me my Powerbook any day of the week.
I like the computer screen. Very bright indeed, and very clear. The sound is terrific, plenty of USB ports, and an iLink port (Firewire) are available, as well as a monitor output and a parallel port.
At 512 MB of RAM, memory is a little on the small side, especially in light of the fact that the VGA card uses some of it.
Now, Sony support is easily the most disappointing ever.
I cleared the hard drive in order to upgrade to Windows XP professional (it came with Home edition), and realized too late that there were no drivers included. Even hours of surfing as well as ordering the backup DVD (they sent me the wrong one) did not provide me with a driver for the ATI video card. It was simply unavailable, even the Sony driver site didn't have many drivers. (for that matter, I couldn't find support for this specific laptop, even amongst hundreds of other models).
Eventually I wound up using an unsupported third party, but nevertheless excellent driver (Radeon Omega, for those of you desperately looking for a VGA driver)
One other complaint, well two. The wireless-g card stops working intermittently. I called Sony tech support (my only recourse in spite of buying considerable extra protection), and they had no clue. They walked me through an install of the card, and simply said 'well, can you get on the Internet?' When I said, yes I can for now, they treated the problem as solved.
My other problem was frequent Blue Screens of Death, to which tech support simply replied 'can't help you there!' When I asked if I could read the minidumps (MS's way of documenting the error), they simply said 'you can't read those.' -- I'll take that with a grain of salt. However, they did recommend I upgrade my memory. After all, I was using Excel and Internet Explorer at the same time.
So I am left with a nasty taste in my mouth about tech support. Unsolved mysteries, blue screens, missing drivers, and wrong DVD's in the wrong language being sent to me. Oh, and being fobbed off by technical support after sinking some hard-earned cash into a rather dear protection plan.
Being both a Mac user as well as a PC user, I can see how the much more expensive Powerbook pays for itself in some ways.
On the whole, the Vaio is decent, but it sure isn't great, and the support is atrocious. A final word on support: Sony's web site is a nightmare to wade through, an endless, frustrating jungle that makes one want to bang one's head against a wall, screaming 'why, why!!'
I have found the Sony Vaio PCG-K13 to be an excellent compromise between a desktop replacement and a laptop. Weighing in at 7.3 pounds, it is fairly portable, and sports an excellent 15" screen. Sony engineers developed the X-Brite LCD technology which allows for a very sharp, bright display that rivals other displays employing SXGA technology. The 64 Mb. ATI Radeon 1GP video adapter provides the graphics quality. On display at a national computer store, the PCG-K13 stood out among the other laptops for brightness and clarity.
The PCG-K13 employs the Fujitsu MHT2040AT 40 Gb. hard drive which is whisper quiet. I have to press my ear to the computer to hear any rotational or seek activity. Likewise for the system fan, which is equally whisper quiet and keeps the computer case cooled nicely. These two factors help provide a very calming computing experience.
Ergonomically, the keyboard and electrostatic touch pad couldn't be better. The large keyboard incorporates full size Enter, Shift, Control (2), Tab and Backspace keys. Keytouch is quiet with good tactile feedback. The touchpad requires very minimal pressure to operate, and the left and right control buttons are large and well placed.
Three USB ports, one Firewire port, a parallel port, external monitor port, PCMCIA slots (2), and standard audio ports are provided. No serial port - USB replaces that.
The negatives? One is short battery life, understandable when feeding a 2.8 Ghz. Pentium 4 processor. Squeezing two hours from the battery would be the most you can expect from this unit. For me, however, this is not a problem - I am rarely away from an AC outlet, and having Pentium 2.8 Ghz. speed makes up for the battery life.
Secondly, nearly 5 Gb. of hard drive space is used by the recovery partition. Rather that supply a recovery CD-Rom, Sony forces you to burn nine disks to provide the recovery set, or purchase a DVD recovery disk from them. You can then recover the 5 Gb. partition for your own use.
Lastly, the 512 Mb. Ram is shared with the ATI adapter, leaving 448 Mb. for system use. Still, system performance is more than adequate.
I would highly recommend this computer for someone wanting an above average mainstream laptop for general computing and perhaps some moderate graphics (Photoshop) work. For gaming or highly detailed design work, you would need to look elsewhere.
At $1399.00 US, with promotions occasionally offering it at $1249.00, this is one laptop well worth considering.
I was looking for new laptop to replace my old dell. I needed something reliable and lightweight with lots of power- And I found exactly what I needed! I was researching online for a while and was seriously considering the little Sony Vaio mostly because of its portability but when I compared specs with the Toshiba satellite series I could not believe the price differences. (...)
So far (I've had the laptop for 3 weeks now) I have had no problems what so ever. One minute after coming out of the box I was already surfing the web! This computer is truely configuration free and can run all my applications including Photoshop without a hitch. I haven't played any high graphics games on it yet but streaming videos and movies look fabulous. The bottow can get very hot though- which is probably why they designed little feet for some venting space. The screen is rather large but it is deceivingly lightweight yet sturdy and very well made.
I highly recommend this laptop. For the price- you can't really beat it.
I just purchased this machine to replace my desktop after looking primarily at the Dell 8600, the 15" Power Book and the HP ZV5160 and am having no second thoughts.  My friends who bought the 8600 are.  By comparison, the Toshiba is a little faster running the same applications, the screen has a bit better picture and the machine is over a pound lighter.  I couldn't justify the extra $1,000 for the Power Book just for the "cool" factor.  And my co-worker who went with the HP returned it a week later due to iffy quality and poor performance and bought a Toshiba.  I am a novice when it comes to computer stuff, but right out of the box this machine was extremely easy to get going.  The wireless worked like a charm.  The machine, despite its light weight, has a very solid feel to it.  For just storing pics and music, surfing the net and handling personal finance issues, I'm sure I over-bought.  I was able to get this machine with a wireless router for $1,500, and I couldn't find anything that even came close for bang-for-the-buck.  My friend tried running some super-intense game, and the machine couldn't quite keep up, but Toshiba doesn't market the machine for that, and that ain't what I got it for.  As someone who has perpetual buyer's remorse, I cannot recommend this machine enough.
Look, I have had this laptop for more than a month and have pushed it to the very limit any computer can go (I am a computer and network technician).  This baby has really impressed me.  Like some other reviewers I was a little hesitant about getting one but, boy am I glad I did.  The form factor is amazing!!  I have two laptops and the averatec is the one I can actually call a "laptop" because of the weight and size.  If you plan on moving alot then weight should be a factor.  This computer boots faster than all my other computers (including P4s).  It does get pretty hot, so watch out.  I use it for network diagnosis at work and it has never failed me.  On the weekends I use it to play music videos non-stop thru sunday night!  Never frozen on me or even slowed down... remember this baby has 512mb of ram.  Look, if you don't have $1700 to dish out for a higher or comparable brand name in the 12.1 inch arena then trust me, get this one, you will be blown away. 12.1, 512mb ram, integrated 802.11g... for the price, this is a no brainer
I was hesitant to buy this model based on several of the reviews I had read here at Amazon. I researched and liked the spec's and the size of the unit, and I couldn't beat the price anywhere for this size. (Sony and Toshiba were in the $1700 range for a thin and light) So I took the risk and jumped in on Averatec. I am VERY PLEASED! This machine is fast, it works great, and the size is outstanding. It fits exactly what its suppose to be, a small form, thin and light machine! I love this unit. No problems no complaints. This is a nice machine. I recommend. Performance is there!
I've had it for about a week now and I'm very pleased.  It's small and light and best of all, half the price of a Sony!  I've seen both good and bad reviews for this item so I was hesitant to buy one.  The construction seems good and it feels nice and solid.  The keyboard layout is a little odd, but I'll get used to it.  I wish they could remove those stupid "Windows" keys and make the space bar a bit wider.  I plugged it into a desktop monitor and was surprised to see it supported up to 1600 x 1200 resolution... and that was just in 32MB video mode.

Pros:
- The price.
- Small and light, a notebook that is actually the size of a notebook!
- Performance, no complaints here!  512MB RAM, 40GB HD, 64MB video, and fast enough for anything I'm likely to do with it.
- DVD+CD-RW combo.

Cons:
- The USB ports could be in a better spot.  It makes using a mouse difficult at times.
- The battery life isn't is good as I'd hoped.
- A little on the noise side.
- The speakers aren't very loud, especially with DVDs.
I purchased this computer elsewhere before it became available on Amazon.  So far (2 weeks) it's a gem.  Nice balance of portability, function and price.  Keyboard seems to have improved since the 3150 version (notably, a larger space key) criticized in some reviews.  Out of the box the fan is noisy, running at max speed, so it's important to "train" the fan in the BIOS power setting menu.  That lowers the fan's speed and noise.  Train the battery while you're at it.  Then in the Windows Control Panel Power Setting adjust the setting to Max Battery to lower the CPU voltage while plugged AND unplugged, thus kicking in the fan less frequently.  Perplexingly, the Notebook/Laptop setting yields low CPU voltage plugged, but high voltage unplugged!  Equally perplexingly, the Desktop/Office setting yields high voltage plugged, but voltage unplugged.  Guess you could switch as needed.  I prefer Max Battery.  Can't comment on durability yet.  Too early, but the construction seems fine.  Two emails to customercare@averatec (inquiring about the fan) were echoed back with no comment!?!  So, not sure about support yet.  But for value this computer is outstanding.  Consider the "P" version with XP Pro for $50 more if you need it.
Bought the Averatec AV3225HS in November 2004

*love the slim & light profile

*AMD processor is a better product than the Intel chips, but the average user cannot tell, but will feel good about not caving into the Intel monopoly (my desktop PC is also an AMD processor :) )

*DC adapter is designed well and not bulky and does not take up space on your wall outlet

*came with XP software and will automatically update

*have installed several home-user software (MS Office, Quicken, etc) without issues

*battery life is about 3hrs, about 2 with wireless modem on all the time

*Wireless modem works very well, as does the builtin ethernet connection

*dvd player/cd burner works well.

*if you're looking for a great laptop that works straight out of the box..this is it!!!!  I recommend this brand over Dell's and HPs for the price and form factor
I don't know if it's just me, but every time I pack my notebook and take it out again,

I have a half imprint of the touch pad square on my screen.

It wipes away, but I'm concerned it might eventually cause permanent damage, and it's really annoying to open to a nasty marking in the middle of the screen.

All in all, it's a great buy though.  My first notebook...
Every other pro & con has been stated in other reviews.

UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE

After a few months of packing my computer in and out of a rather expensive and well-cushioned laptop backpack, that pressure from the touchpad on the LCD finally caused damage.  My LCD broke, with the crack starting exactly where it made contact with the touchpad.  This was all due to a complete lack of effective cushion padding on the LCD (those little bumpers at the bottom of the LCD).

I called Averatec, and they said I could send it in, it would be covered by warrenty, and I'd have it back in a few weeks.  Soon after, I got a call from fremontek (handles Averatec warrenty and repairs) telling me that it's NOT covered, and I'd have to pay $355 to get it back repaired, or about $60 just to get it back the way it was!  I had already paid for shipping, so WTF!  I had them send it back to the tech three times, each time explaining that the damage was due to a factory defect (no cushion pads, touchpad contact with LCD, etc...), but the warrenty clearly states that "physical damage to the LCD" is not covered, even though any damage due to a manufacturer's defect is...  I was pissed.

I ended up paying for repairs, but my billing authorization statement declares that the damage was due to no cushion padding, a manufacturer's defect, and that the new LCD must have significant cushion padding.  Since they took the money, they must have agreed to the statement.  If I get another LCD that presses against the touchpad, I will be royally pissed off.  It should get here tomorrow...

This whole experience has taught me NEVER BUY FROM AVERATEC, and may even have converted me to Apple.

UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE

lol - Apple..? What was I thinking?  :P

The new screen was the glossy kind, and much better than the old.  The notebook served several more years of use after being repaired, and has been passed on to a friend now.  I suppose I got my money's worth out of it in the end, but still wouldn't recommend Averatec, especially with the range of competitive options these days (3/2/2009).
I have owned this AV3250Hs-01 for 1 month now. This is my 3rd laptop/notebook in as many years. The previous were two were Sony pcg-fx47" and pcg-grv670". I decided to go light weight and was compelled to get this one becuase of the price,size and specs.

Here are the Pros ans Cons

Pros:

Price - Good Value compared to what is out in the market

Specs - 80GB HD and DVD/RW

Screen - Bright and clear no dead pixels (but not ultra bright compared to my Sony)

Mobility - Very light

Cons:

Keyboard - It is a bit small, I don't like where the FN key is located, in the bottom left. It interferes when you try to do a CtL +V, etc. Takes time to get used to. Space bar a little too small, what I am used to.

Keyboard - Kind of rough, is not as silent compared to what I have had in the past.

Battery - could be better since, I was thinking it was smaller it would last longer. I am able to get 2 1/2 hours. Better than what I have had in the past.

USB ports - There are three side by side and I noticed that when I connect a USB device (mouse) and a Lexar Flash Memory I am not able to use the 3rd, since it does not fit.

DVD - I can not say they are all like this but the DVD drive was a bit loud.

Overall, I can give this laptop 3.5 - 4 stars. The cons I mentioned, i figure I can adjust to, so it is not as bad. I would recommend this for students who need a laptop for school and also other people who are on the go.
To be brief, the other reviews are dead on with the portability of this laptop. What they failed to mention is the quality of the LCD screen, or there lack of. It is bright and crisp, because it is made for just 1024x768, your other option of course 800x600 with very poor image quality.

The other downfall with these laptops is the blown out pixels that come with every version of your 3200, at least in my case, this might not be the case for others. I returned one 3200 hundred due to mouse problems, but also had 2 black blown out pixels right in the middle of the screen. BRAND NEW OUT OF THE BOX, BAM, two pixels out, my luck. Luckily I was returning this laptop because of the mouse, otherwise, they'll tell you industry standards are 8 pixels at least before it can be returned. That comment concerned me, but I shrugged it off because I was told I was to receive a new 3200. Joy, after 2 weeks and no laptop, I received the new one. Opened the box, gently took it out of the rapping, placed it on a secure surface, turn it on (loads fast)...you know the black window before load up into Windows. HAHA, another two blown out pixels, but at least these are on the sides and white. In Windows you cant notice them all the time, I guess.

Otherwise, it's small, light, and great to carry around.

Boy those pixels are annoying at startup. Love you though AMD (starts up fast).

I would have given the Averatec 3200 a 4 out of 5, but deduct 2 for the 2 pixels taken from me.
This is a great, fast PC that meets all of my needs. I am a graduate student and it gives me plenty of speed and the wireless works great. The weight is great, and it leaves my backpack light enough that my chiropractor has stopped yelling at me. I did upgrade the OS to XP-Pro, Service Pack 2, but that is the only upgrade that I have made.

Pros: Light weight, processing speed, bright screen.

Indifferent: Battery life: Averatec says that the battery lasts up to 3 hours. I think that the three hours is if you turn it on, put it in a corner and leave it there with the wireless adapter turned off. Which is exactly how they ran their tests. I did take the time to tune the battery, and I get pretty good life out of it-- with the wireless on, I get about 2.5 hours. I did make the investment in an I-Go Juice AC adapter which includes a car adapter, which I find very convient.

Cons: Speakers are a little tinny sounding, but I usually use headphones or external speakers. It does run a little warm, but not hot enought to become uncomfortable or to keep my coffee warm. The fan is a little loud, but that is the case for all thin and lights.

Great notebook for the price.
I love love love this little beautiful powerful machine.  It is the perfect weight, the perfect look, and so easy to operate. It is lighter than most of my textbooks. I heard complaints about the keyboard and realize that those people are just whiners, or maybe i am just blessed with small fingers.  It is so sleek and the awesome wireless internet is a big plus.  bottom line, absolutely amazing price for what would cost at lest 50% more if it was a Vaio or Compaq.  No complaints at all!
the good:

small

512 mram

40 gigabytes

low price

the bad:

battery is bad

bad distribuid keyboard

one enter pcmcia

only usb ports

bad sound (pour max sound)
If when playing a dvd, the sound isn't loud enough, use the included "power dvd" software and NOT windows media player. for some reason, the sound is a lot louder when using power dvd.

This is a great product and a great value! Would buy again.
I bought this yesterday for $700ar at microcenter la,ca and it is way cool.  Deal ends 8-28 or 29

buy it if you want light, good ram and wireless.

b the envy of your friends 4 no money
I researched laptops for a few weeks before deciding on the av3225hs. It runs smooth and quickly. Nice screen resolution.

Fairly easy to boot up and use although the keyboard is indeed tricky but not the end of the world...it just will take adaptation. The lightness and small package makes the transition worthwhile.

It does heat up quickly and is almost uncomfortable but there should be air conditioning in starbucks so put it on a table and you'll be fine.

The battery sucks even after I calibrated it and the fan. Don't go on a trip without the power cord...in fact don't go anywhere without the power cord since at peak usage battery life is at best 45 min.

Read the product specs carefully: amazon touted this little gem with an extra 512 stick of ram for free. It only has one slot with a max of 512. I'm stuck with a stick of ram I can't use now---shame on you amazon!

With over a gig of memory this machine would be great but as is its just OK and pefectly serviceable. Now I'm waiting to see if it'll crap out on me.

Caveat Emptor!
A bright, clear screen, large hard drive, speedy processor, wireless LAN, smooth touchpad, and longer-than-average battery life all tucked into a tight and inexpensive 12-inch package.  Yeah, there's lots to complain about there.

I guess you could find stuff, if you really wanted to.  The keyboard *is* small, but why order a 12-inch laptop if you're only going to whine and moan about the size of the keyboard? Sure, it'd be nice if the battery lasted forever, but this isn't an iBook; you're getting twice the computing power for less money, so some sacrifices become necessary.  Anyone who's ever tried typing on an iBook, and then on the Averatec 3200 will tell you that the Averatec is a much more user-friendly machine, because your hands never accidentally graze the touchpad, so the cursor stays where you left it.

The analog volume control is especially nice, since I detest changing volume with the keyboard.  All ports plus the DVD/CD drive are thoughtfully placed (on the sides instead of the back), and the 1.5 inch speakers are clear and strong, in spite of what some perpetually dissatisfied prima donnas will tell you.  What kind of person complains about the sound quality from a couple of speakers no bigger than your thumb?  Give me a break.  "Hmm, this Volkswagen Beetle isn't too fast, let me whine about it for a while."

Anyone who has ever owned or used a laptop for WORK will be thrilled with the Averatec 3200.  Forget the opinions of the spoiled gaming fanboys who'd complain about a free lunch if they didn't get enough salt on their fries; this is a great machine.  No, it's not gonna run DOOM 3 or FAR CRY, but what kind of n00b would expect it to?

If you're in the market for a laptop, you'd could do worse than Averatec.  Hopefully they'll be around for a long time.
I thought I would put the record straight on this laptop. I have been using portable computers for over 19 years since the Compaq luggable, and currently own the following notebooks :

- Thinkpad T41

- Sony VAIO K23

- Dell Inspiron 5150

- Apple iBook 12 inch

- Thinkpad 600E

- eMachines M6809 (another AMD - 64 bit Athlon)

....so you will find this review very accurate and unbiased.

First of all, this is an OUTSTANDING laptop for under $1,000. It has a fast processor and hard disk and 512MB of RAM is enough for most tasks and quite a bit of multi-tasking. It is well-built, with a very sturdy magnesium alloy frame, although some would say it could look a bit cheap.

The screen is very bright and sharp and I don't find 1024x768 at all restrictive in a 12-inch screen size....I would say it is just perfect.

The keyboard.....ah yes, the keyboard. Well, all the letter keys are great  full-size keys with a good travel and a nice feel. The only thing that may take some getting used to on the keyboard is as follows :

- several keys are smaller than what you will be used to, including all the function keys and all the number keys along the top, but they are definitely usable.

- The PGUP, PGDN, HOME and END keys have to have the FN key pressed as well , so that takes a little getting used to.

- Probably the worst one for me was the size of the BACKSPACE key, as I use this a lot :-)

- The comma and period keys are also smaller.

However, take it from me, this is a VERY usable keyboard.

The wireless card and antenna give the best reception out of all of my notebook computers, which is really nice. The battery life is over 2.5 hours, which is good and well within parameters for its class. The batteries are only $99, so I got a spare one for long trips. Three handy USB ports on the right hand side make connecting peripherals a snap, although they are placed close together.

This machine has the nicest touchpad I have ever come across - a beautiful light feel and tap-and-drag with locking drags means that you never ever have to use the left mouse button! It's a synaptics model, so up there in quality with the best.

The machine does get a little hot, so you will need to put it on a magazine if you have it on your lap a lot - I got a Targus lap desk from CompUSA. This will increase the airflow to the fan as well, so worth the investment.

So do NOT believe the naysayers.....RUN, don't walk to the nearest outlet and buy one of these. You will not regret it for one moment, believe me. FANTASTIC quality, specifications and performance for the price.....unbeliveable, really.

I use this more than my Thinkpad, which is saying something, huh ?

Cheers

Steve
look I just bought this little guy today and it works great. I was a little scared of wasting my money but i have no regrets. I'm going to be honest, I heard in some of the reviews from here that the sound stinks ], but it's not true. No,it's not like a stereo loud but it's definetely loud enough. Let's see the speed is great, and for the price it's sweet. I got it for 950.00 at a local store. If your looking for a laptop that kicks butt get this one I'm serious it's great. I'll keep you updated.
ive had this little guy for a couple of weeks now and i am so happy i got it. This is the best little machine for the money, as you'll pay 300 more for any other thats heavier, has only 526 ram and only a 30gb hard drive. The scathing reviews i have seen of this model have been from people expecting too much... this is not a pc for graphics, but it handles DVDs fine, although you'd be better off using a pair of headphones to listen to them. Laptop magazine has given this a 'best buy', and i agree.

 Some things to note:

 The little keyboard may prove a problem for someone with big hands, as some of the keys are shrunk for space.

 The battery life isn't up to par, it lasts only about two hours, not the three as advertised, so i'll be asking for a second come christmas.

 it can get a bit warmer than i expected it to, but thats of small matter in the big picture, if you keep in mind to put a coaster or something simple under it to give the fan a bit more space to work with, its realy no incovenience.

 You won't regret this purchase and you'll save a good $100 in the end... good on averatec.
I researched this laptop for quite a while before plunking down my hard earned ducets - so far it's lived up to my expectations (which were high).

 Criteria to chose this laptop:

 -Need a small, light, reasonably fast laptop for a great price.

 Do not choose this laptop if:

 -You need crazy battery life.

 -You can't adapt to a different keyboard layout.

 -You really need a 3GHz P4's speed.

 -You want a big screen

 Positives:

 -Price. Watch for rebates on this one. You can get it for a good chunk less than the retail if you're ready to purchase and can grab a week-long rebate deal. For the money you're getting a ton. Compared with small and lights from Gateway, IBM etc. you're doing it for half the price - and getting the same features.

 -Performance. The processor and HDD are fast (the latter being almost more important) and 512 MB of RAM is really great for photo/vid editing. Overall this much speed should last you for a long time. I'm looking for a good 5 years out of this thing.

 -Size. This thing is small. 4.3 pounds or something. It's almost the same size as a 12" G4 Powerbook overall.

 -Screen. It's sharp and bright. So bright that I have it turned all the way down and it's still pretty darned bright.

 Negatives:

 -Avera-who? It helps if you're computer savvy and won't need Customer Support other than for a return for service.

 -Keyboard. Somebody covered this but basically it'll take a bit of rewiring. I love my home/end/pgup/pgdn keys so you either need to get used to pressing FN at the same time or remap your keys in software.

 -Battery. 2.5 hours is what I get - inching towards three if I have WLAN off and screen turned down. I think this is plenty of time - but then again my last laptop lasted 1 hour :)

 -Size. A positive and negative. It's impossible to have a light laptop that's got a large screen (well, for less than 2500 it is). So realize that you'll have less screen real estate than you might be used to. I moved from a 15.1 to this 12.1 and I'm OK.

 Non-issues:

 -Lack of a printer port - c'mon, buy a new printer. Don't worry about this.

 -Only one expansion slot - it's got 802.11G built in and 3 USB 2.0 jacks. I'm not sure that I'll ever have anything in the PCMCIA slot.

 Overall:

 If you're a student or professional in need of a portable computer then this is your absolute best bet. I would recommend this computer to anybody. Why not 5 stars? Well...nothing's perfect and the keyboard could conceivably bug some people. Would I buy it again? Yeah, I'm buying two more in a few months for my brothers.

 I hope this helps - take care!
I was tired of lugging heavy laptops around; to work, on trips.  I didn't wnat to pay $2000+ for a 512 MB laptop.  The IBM is light but expensive and you don't even get an optical drive.  This laptop has a DVD/CD-burner built-in.  This Averatec has been a value purchase.  I took it with me to Macedonia on a Northwest Medical Team mission and was able to download digital pictures and recordings then select and burn mini-cds to give to our hosts.
The battery does not last 3 1/2 hours; more like a little over 2. It's a small negative when you literally save $1000.
I think that this is the best notebook for the money.  If you are looking for the basics...this is it!  I was a little afraid of the name brand, but it's been great!  It's fast and it works great for me! The built in wireless LAN is fantastic. My only gripe is that the battery does not last 3+ hours like it says on the label. I find that it lasts on average of 2 hrs and 45 mins at best. It has to be good...my daughter snags it whenever she can...we are pretty tough critics.  Save your money and buy this one.
I bought this machine to replace my Toshiba with something a little lighter as I also carry an iBook (need Unix for work)  This gem has eclipsed the iBook as well as I have it dual booting Debian linux and windows XP.  The battery life is a bit short (2 hours) but more batteries are reasonable.
The keyboard is well designed, something hard to find on a low-cost small machine.
I've owned 20 notebooks and this is my second favorite (after my old Libretto).  For less than $1,000 it is the best value around and even without considering the low price it is a great machine!
First and foremost, I too was hesitant about buying this laptop given it's mixed ratings.  I'm pretty tech savy, so I do my research and I make sure I'm getting a good product before I buy ANY PC. So after reading reviews, I took the plunge, and I myself became a skeptic; the one I took home from a local store had a keyboard that was messed up, typing two characters for each key (talk about weird typing).
However, since buying mine about a month ago, I've been pleased with it's results.  I've given serious thought to this review, and will try and point out all the good, and the bad. In a nutshell, you really need to think about WHAT you want to do with your labtop PC before you buy this computer.  First let's look at the basics.
First, if you're looking for long battery life, this isn't the one for you.  In fact, if battery life is very important to you, just spend the extra cash for one with Intel's Centrino Mobile Technology (you can't beat them for battery power).  Averatec's PC will give you about 2.5 hours of battery life on this model (why they say 3 is beyond me).  For most people doing typing, spreadsheet work, scanning, etc that's going to be enough.  You could always buy a second battery too (they aren't THAT much.)  It makes a good PC for Office, Library, Class, Home, etc work. If you're looking to run DVD's all the time, or constantly stay on the Wireless network, then you're not going to get good battery life. It's the ideal PC for a student in my opinion for class; especially given it's small size.  The wireless network is also great, and it's easy to cut on and off (button right on the top)... so you can save battery life easily.
The next factor is Size.  This labtop is one of the best money can buy for it's size and weight.  That's one of the main reasons I looked at it, and purchased it.  Sony's smaller labtops cost an arm and a leg, and just aren't worth it.  If you need a small, compact PC, Averatec is for you.  It's a powerful little PC with a lot built in... again, just consider how much battery life you need. I use mine mostly for work at the University and Documentation stuff.  I also will use it for business when I travel for photo's, etc.  So to me, this is ideal.
Next thing, like others have said, the keyboard may take some getting used to.  But it's a trade for the small size, so I can't complain.  It hasn't been a huge annoyance for me; nothing as bad as some make it sound anyway. My main complaint was the same as another reviewer; that the Control key (Ctrl) has been replaced with the Function key and is now situated to the right of this Function key.  It can be annoying at times.  Other than that, no problems honestly.
Another thing is how the PC can heat up.  While I don't personally care how much it heats up, if you do, then you might want to avoid the PC.  I've been surprised how heated it gets. Again, if you're using this thing on a desk, no problem. If it's sitting in your lab, just use a book; otherwise avoid the PC... it can get rather warm.
The last thing that I can think about is the Speakers and Sound.  This is NOT a PC for good sound quality, it just sounds flat.  Again, if you're using this for an Office/Classroom PC, that's not an issue.
One thing I love about Averatec's PC is the three USB ports on the front side on the right.  While the location is a bit weird, it's great having them for flash cards, scanner, a mouse, etc.
The PC can also support great monitor resolution... another perk if you're using it in an Office setting with a larger monitor.
Another downside is the fact it lacks a normal Printer cable connection.  Most printers use USB now anyway, but it still would be nice to have it at times.
I'll close out with one last thing.  Performance wise I'm very impressed.  I really pushed my labtop hard to see how much I could get it to run at the same time, and it did very well.  I used heavy photo programs, Macromedia Flash, GIS software, etc all at once to test it; not bad if I may say so myself, and I'm very picky about speed.  It was one of the reasons I was hesitant to buy it, but AMD has impressed me again here.  I also loved the wireless network feature... it's great and I can go anywhere in my house now and surf the net, access files on my desktop PC's, etc. It's great! A lot of University's are building these wireless networks into their campuses now, which makes it even better for the student.
Finally, here's two tips I'd offer:
Calibrate the Battery. You can find the manual for this PC on Averatec's website, or in the "My Documents" folder of your labtop.  It takes a loooong time to calibrate, but it's a good way to keep your battery alive longer.
Speaking of calibration, make sure you also calibrate the fan. It's easy to do, just follow the manual as before and it'll help keep the fan quite more.
Overall, I love this PC.  I wouldn't trade it back for another one and have no regrets on buying it.  It's not perfect by any means, but for the price, size, weight, and performance, you really cannot beat it.  It had PC Mags Editor's Choice award for a reason.  I too have found it impressive.
If you buy it locally, get the extended warranty.  It's always smart to do this with a PC.  I did, and I think it'll be worth it if something goes wrong.
I recently bought an Averatec AV3225HS notebook computer.  At first glance, this computer looks like a powerhouse in a small package.  After a month of use and a week of wrangling with Averatec's customer "service" (an oxymoron), it is difficult to recommend this computer for anyone who wants a battery-powered unit.  The battery power is such a problem that one third of the reviews on Circuit City's site complain about it.  Averatec should look seriously at this, take notes, and work out some kind of genuine conciliation for current owners.
  For the experienced notebook user this notebook is not a good buy due to its deficiencies and substandard quality.  To make my point, I simply refer to Averatec's manual for this unit (page 39), in which they caution users "AVOID OPERATING" this computer on "battery power" for the Internet, faxing, and audio or video (CD/DVDs).  Imagine that-a battery powered notebook warning you to "avoid" using the battery power to access it's most commonly-used features!  But isn't "battery power" the very reason we buy notebooks?  This warning is not placed on the box or within the boxed documentation.  This secret is only available when one locates the PDF manual on the hard drive.  The end user is never told by the company that such a manual exists on the hard drive until they call customer service (which is another problem for this company).
  I have not read of a single person in on the Internet who has obtained this amazing 3+ hour feat with this machine.  Rather, most people complain that the battery drains between 1 or 2 hours.  Mine ranged from 40 to 60 minutes, so I called the company.  More on that later.
  Averatec states the following on two feature stickers near the mouse pad, "High Performance and Long Battery Life ... The Ultimate Mobile Computer ... 56k Modem ... Built-in DVD Player and CD Burner ... Mobility Without Boundaries ... Surf the internet faster ... New Low Voltage Mobile AMD Athlon XP-M Processor Low Voltage = Longer Battery Life (up to 3+ hours)."  Regardless of these unproven statements, this conflicts with their warning to "avoid operating" while surfing the internet, listening to music, or watching MPEGs or DVDs.  Something that important should be put out front for the consumer to see before purchasing.
  Additional problems with the Averatec AV3225H:
  1. Calibrating the Battery.  The battery power is the poorest, yet most important component of this notebook.  I found from another Internet post that the Averatec recommends calibrating the battery as per the instructions in the PDF manual. How will someone know this if it isn't in the boxed documentation?  Nevertheless, I calibrated the battery twice and got 41 minutes battery life in my tests following calibration.
  2. The poorly designed keyboard may require changing habits and new key memorization from standard notebook keyboards.  It will slow down the average typist due corrections when the incorrect key is typed.  This is an unnecessary annoyance.  An example is the Page up, Page down, Home, and End keys.  These keys are only activated with two-hands (one to press the function key and one to navigate the page).  Others have complained that the backspace and delete keys that are altered.  I also found the Control key (Ctrl) quite a problem, since it's standard location has been replaced with the Function key.
  3. This notebook runs hot, so the fan runs considerably longer and louder than on other units I've owned.  Others on the Internet have complained that the unit gets so hot that it is uncomfortable on the lap and defeats its "lap-top" notebook purpose.  Averatec told me that a safety mechanism prevents damage to the CPU by shutting the unit down if it gets hot enough to cause damage.
  4. The screen automatically dims when switched to batter power.  If you want to keep your screen brightness, you must manually adjust it each time you switch power.
  5. I fully agree with others who complain about the poor audio quality for this notebook.  This unit sounds tinny.
  6. There are three handy USB ports on the right side.  Those who use flash drives (jump drive, thumb drive) or other devices with thick USB plugs will only be able to use two simultaneous USB ports due to their tight proximity.
  7. As noted above, I called Averatec to talk with them about these problems.  Their customer service was poor.  In my initial call, they took notes on my problems and read them back.  They took my contact information and said that they will e-mail me the following day or two.  I spoke to four Averatec representatives in one week, all of whom took my contact information and e-mail address.  Three of the four lost my e-mail address and someone closed my case before it was resolved.  The forth person told me that the other three representatives were wrong on their analysis of my problem and she insisted that I send the entire computer to the repair facility.  It took a week and four representatives to get this far.  This was one of the poorest excuses for customer service I've seen in years.
  Conclusion:  People talk about the money saved ($400 to $500) by buying this notebook instead of other units.  I have owed the other notebooks and, even though this unit touts a fast CPU and a few other features that work better within the reach of a power outlet, it lacks too much when not plugged in.  I would recommend that you take Averatec's published advice and "avoid operating" this notebook if you plan Internet, audio, or video usage on battery power and don't waste your time and money buying it.  Instead, go ahead and spend the extra money and buy something with higher quality and better customer service.
I bought this computer about two months ago and exchanged it for another unit because of the "cling" sounds from the hard drive that was mentioned by A PC Hardware Fan on May 17, 2004.  To me it sounded like the head of the hard drive hitting against something.  Well, the new unit has the same problem.  The "cling", or "click", sounds don't occur often, but they are more frequent when using Windows Media Player.  I called Averatec customer support thinking they might have documented this problem before, but they were unaware of it.  If anyone can shed some light on this matter, please do.

Overall, the computer is a fine product--I use it all the time now in place of a Dell Inspiron.  I love the light weight, and the AC adapter is compact too.  The keyboard is durable but feels flimsy.  The rotary dial for volume control is a nice feature, but the fan is a bit on the noisy side even after calibration.  In my opinion, Averatec made the right decision in leaving out the parallel port, serial port, etc.  Beside this, I agree with the reviews others have given on the product--incomparable ultra-portable performance for the price.  I would, however, strongly recommend spending a little more for 512MB RAM.
I've had this laptop for a little over a month.  I thought the 256 mb of ram was more than adequate, but bought another stick of 512 and sold the 256 anyway.  I honestly didn't see a big improvement in my day to day programs, but there might be benefits to getting the 3225 or 3255.
I've used my laptop at simple lan parties, playing CS and UT and it works pretty decently, playable.
When on battery, I typically leave my power settings to Max battery, and can usually manage just under 3 hours, I think if I turned off the wireless, I'd be able to hit the 3 hour mark. Max Battery usually leaves the computer running at about 400 mhz, but that's been more than enough for my typical web browsing.
My sister has a Dell and for the price, I don't think I ended up too badly, it feels like the Averatec is very solidly built, but maybe because it's only a month old.
The wireless works very well also, my friend has a Dell D400, very nice and small, but more expensive.  At some places, I could connect to wireless accesspoints he couldn't even see.
One night, we got our new accesspoint, one with WPA and I couldn't get it to work with the Broadcom software.  I called around 4:00 am local (eastern) and got a personal customer service person to answer my question immediatly.
One gripe I had was the LCD.  It seems somewhat washed out, especially next to a desktop LCD.  It's also difficult to read at an angle (compared to other laptops I've seen), but that wasn't a problem at all, since I'm really the only one that needs to see it.
Overall, the laptop had been great, especially for the price paid.  3 USB ports, no unnecessary Parallel, Serial or PS2 ports.
Strengths:
Amazing value for money without compromising on features. Built in wifi, CDRW, DVD, compact and light all in a beautiful Sony-like case
Weaknesses:
Could do with more memory as standard and longer battery life - about 3 hours real world.
Summary:
I didn't want a desktop replacement; I wanted a small, wireless laptop to use around the house which was powerful enough to do a little image editing on vacation and could be used as a portable DVD player when I was occasionally marooned in a hotel room. I would have liked the Sony 10" sub-notebook but my pocketbook didn't stretch that far. (...)
At this bargain price, I was expecting to be disappointed with build quality and design but it compares favorably with the alloy cased Sonys. Compared to my old laptop, the Averatec weighs half as much and is much more compact; that said, the keyboard and screen are both still very usable. The 12" screen is just big enough when I'm away from my desktop. When I want to do some serious work I go back to my 21", color balanced CRT and desktop.
The AMD processor seems to have enough horses to get things done and I've even played some of my older PC games on the machine, though it's modest graphics capabilities would probably struggle with the latest releases. The design sensibly omits com, midi, mouse, keyboard and printer ports in favor of 3 USB2 ports. If this were a desktop replacement this would be a disappointment but in an ultra-portable it makes sense.
Battery life is reasonable but not astounding. A nice feature of the design is that it incorporates a switch to turn off the wireless transceiver on the fly when you want to save power. Another nice feature is that it is not only the machine that is scaled down but it's power brick too allowing you to travel much lighter.
Overall I highly recommend this machine especially if you are lusting after a sub-notebook or ultra-portable but don't want to pay the usual premium for a diminutive laptop. All my geek friends who I have shown this PC to can't believe how much machine you get for your money in such a neat package.
Let me first qualify this review by saying that:
1) I am/was a lifetime PC user with no prior Mac experience.
2) Before buying this notebook I comparison shopped for 3 months
3) My computer knowledge is far below that of tech professionals and hard core PC hobbyists, but I am however very computer literate.--> in short I'm an everyday computer user/consumer.

Secondly before contemplating a powerbook any further, if you are an avid gamer or buy 3 or more video games a year and you want to use this notebook as a gaming laptop... I'd suggest you you buy a PC notebook for that purpose.  Powerbooks are powerful enough to play games, but the mac selection of games is sparse.  And now finally to the review...

Specs- As with any notebook I suggest you have at least 512 MB of RAM.  This was the only upgrade I added to my Powerbook.  The Powerbook comes standard with a very generous 60gig hard drive, USB, firewire 400, ethernet, WIFI(b/g) and bluetooth.  The only thing missing is the firewire 800, but that is not essential for most users including me.  The Powerbook also comes with a very speedy 1.33 GHZ G4.  How does this stack up to the new Centrino's (Pentium M)?  Compared to my brother's IBM Thinkpad with a Pentium M 1.3 w/ 512 RAM, it runs equivalent or faster to the naked eye, unfortunately benchmarks are not readily available to compare mac and pc.  But needless to say, whatever I can do on the IBM, whether its Powerpoint presentations, Photoshop, Flash, video or photo editing, I can do it on the Powerbook just as fast or faster.  Also something that is very unique to this ultraportable is the 64 MB nVidia graphics card.  Although there are better graphics cards out there on midsized laptops, ultraportable laptops RARELY have a graphics card as nice as this one.

Combodrive- slot loading.  This is amazing.  No cd tray to deal with popping in and out.  Just insert the cd or dvd into the slot and it is ready to go.  This is not only a spacesaver since there is no tray, but it also is less prone to break since there is no tray to snag and break off.  Why did I not pick the Superdrive that is also offered with this computer?  In a few months they are releasing dual-layer DVD writers that hold twice as much data as writeable dvd's currently do, so I'm waiting to get an external DVD writer.  Also its good to notice that many computers in order to stay small do not even include an optical drive like the Powerbook does.

Price- Sony, IBM, Dell, Gateway.  These companies all offer 12" notebooks, but customize them to equivalent specs as the Powerbook and they all come out approximately equivalent or much more expensive than the Powerbook.  Apple is known for higher prices of their computers, but the Powerbook (specifically the 12" model) is a great deal price wise.

Battery Life- This is VERY important if you want to tote your laptop around (and if you don't want to tote a laptop around, then why get a laptop at all?).  Battery life is 5+ hours in my experience when just surfing the net and downloading files.  Again how does this compare with other PC models?  I think if you research you will find that most ultraportable Centrino's without an optional larger battery average around 4 hours.  The IBM mention earlier lasts us about 4 and a half hours of use.

Operating system- I think a description of this is beyond the scope of the review, but in short Mac OS X (Panther) is an absolute delight.  I personally had very few problems with Windows XP, but it isn't just about the stability of Mac OS X its about the ease of use, integration and beauty of the system.  Its something you just have to use first hand to fully realize it.  Combine this with the excellent iLife programs that allow you to make movies, listen to music, video conference with relatives, and organize your photos and its very easy to forget about Windows.

Design-  I recommend you go to a local electronic store and hold the PC laptops in your hand and type on them and just look at them all over inlcuding the bottom.  Then take a look at an Apple Powerbook.  Again its something that is more adequately experienced than described.  From the glowing Apple symbol on the cover to the almost seamless bottom, it is an amazing feeling, solid, and beautiful notebook.  Everything else just feels cheap in your hands.  Also the screen is crisp and clear and the keyboard is a full-sized keyboard, not a miniature one, that is perfect for typing.

Laptop Heat and Sound- Use of the Powerbook for about 4 hours, I noticed it got only mildly warm and much less so than the IBM.  However after about 4 hours the Powerbook got about as hot as the IBM, which still is not hot at all.  I would say you could comfortably put the laptop in you lap very easily for the first 4 hours.  After that, unless you have thick pants or like the extra warmth, I'd suggest putting it on a table.  The Powerbook is very, very quiet, especially when cool.  When it heats up after prolonged use the fan will kick in more often and make it a little louder.  But still it is much more quiet than the IBM.

Overall-  I'd HIGHLY recommend this to anyone except gamers.  I'm highly satisfied with this purchase and I hope you will be to if you decide to buy it.

EDIT- 10/5/06
I guess this edit is just for people wanting to buy this computer used.  Let me first start off by saying I still give this product 5 stars.  It is a beautiful machine and very capable.

Since this review I've upgraded the RAM to the documented max, which is 1.25 gigs.  My system runs smooth as ever.  Also my hard drive failed at about 2 years, fortunately I was able to back up my files due to being warned in advance by OS X.  I do not contribute this to Apple though since I have treated my laptop roughly, bringing it everywhere with me (it is such a small machine after all!) and being less than careful.  Also the batteries of many of these Powerbooks have been recalled (Dell and many other companies have had to deal with similar recalls).

Leopard is going to be released soon and due to the robust videocard (at the time at least for such a small computer such as this) I will be able to view the newest version of OS X with all of the Core Image eye-candy intact.

2 and a half years- no virus infections, no spyware, no adware.  no blue screen of death.
Well, first I'd like to say that I feel honored to be the first one writing a review of this wonderful laptop.
I purchased this Powerbook G4 on tuesday - just one day after Apple announced the new Powerbook lineup.  I had been considering going back to apple for a new laptop for quite some time, but seeing new faster specs for the same price as the last revision was what did it for me!  I custom ordered mine from the Apple Store on tuesday and it shipped out late Thursday night/Friday morning.  I had it by Monday morning - but what a trip it had!
Normal specs for this laptop are 1.33Ghz G4 processor, 256 MB RAM (built in/upgradable via ram slot to 1.25GHZ), 60 GB 4200 RPM HD (as almost all laptops have), 64 MB of VRAM on an nVidia GeForce FX Go5200 card on 4x AGP bus, 12" GORGEOUS display, upgraded 167 MHZ system bus speed, including updated software - Panther 10.3.3, iLife '04, etc etc.
I custom ordered mine from their store with 512 MB RAM and upgraded 5400 RPM 80 GB hard drive (because I wanted to get it nice and quick), a nice Brenthaven Pro File 12" laptop bag and a .Mac membership.  It shipped out from Taiwan, headed over to Alaska, then through a few other states and finally to me in NJ....
This powerbook is a work of art; even the packaging.  It has gorgeous features, fluid graphic motion, VERY speedy processor, GREAT battery life - I get about 4.5 hrs.  Their estimated 5 hrs is very likely if you don't upgrade to a faster hard drive (eats more power)....the OS is amazing, I was up and running within 10 minutes or so - the battery came with a full charge from the factory so I could use the laptop immediately.
I only have one minor complaint - Ive had this for a week or so now, and my spacebar has begun to squeak when I press it.  Every other laptop I've ever had developed this squeaky spacebar so I don't blame apple -- its probably just the result of how I type.  I highly recommend this laptop for its size and portability.  It's durable finish, great cooling - yes its warm to the touch, but by no means will you burn yourself as others have suggested in past reviews of their previous version of this powerbook.  CD-ROM drive is zippy, magnetic lid clasp mechanism is a marvel, breathing (dimming and getting brighter) LED light on the lid-open button when the computer is in sleep mode is great....everything is great.
This laptop opens Corel Painter 8 within 3 seconds which I consider amazing considering my 1.3Ghz P4 desktop PC can only open it in about 10-15 seconds!  This computer flies through everything it does and it certainly could be a desktop replacement.  The casing is sturdy and shines like a new penny!  The apple illuminates on the back side of the display showing everyone in a subdued manner that you chose the best.  Even their power supply/cable design is astounding - having the option to extend it if you need more cable length is great.  There is a charging status ring where the cable plugs into the side of the laptop which is orange when charging and green when fully charged.  To check the battery status, you can push a small button on the battery which will light up a series of LED lights on the battery to indicate how full a charge it holds.  Amazing!
I'm glad to be back in the Apple world and look forward to getting a G5 tower to replace my aging PC in the coming year or so.
Wow I love this Powerbook!
I bought a PowerBook 12" 867MHz about nine months ago, had a brief fling with a Dell that my work issued me, and went back to the Mac.  Then, in a fit of insanity, I clicked "buy" and now I am a very happy owner of the 17" 1.5GHz.
Positives:
- The screen is just massive, and you don't need to be a graphic artist or movie producer to use it; it works great for Excel, side-by-side document editing, or just keeping iChat and Sticky Notes in view while surfing the web
- It's pretty fast; I'm finally happy with the performance of Virtual PC 6.0 running Windows 2000 and Outlook XP; as a matter of fact I've duplicated my Windows work laptop in VPC and no longer have to carry two machines around
- Movies are incredible on the big screen, and the speakers have great stereo separation (to the point that sometimes working late at night, I think I hear someone in the room, and it turns out to be part of the song)
- It's quite thin, even compared to the 12", which is good on my wrists when typing
Negatives:
- Trying to get around the massive screen with the touchpad is a chore; get an external mouse ASAP
- Sitting in bed working on e-mail can be a bit difficult, because if you end up slanting the PowerBook upwards, the cover wants to close
- Even though this is one of the smallest 17" laptops out there, you just can't get away from the fact that it's a big monster of a machine when you spread out on a desk, airplane tray table, or other area
It's not hype. This is the best 15" notebook I've seen, and I've seen a lot of notebooks in this form factor. Price out a similarly equipped PC notebook and the Apple comes in cheaper. The screen quality problems have been solved, tho there definitely were some problems with the previous generation of this laptop. The performance is very impressive with the high end grapics card and speedy hard drive. Its biggest advantage over PC laptops is the operating system. Mac OS X is far ahead of Windows in terms of stability, speed, features, lack of infections and compatibility. Unlike what the reviewer says about the UK, there is no service charge for warranty repairs in the States. Actually, I'm surprised there's a charge in the UK. If I had to pay for warranty repairs, I'd be pretty steamed!
I bought a G4 Powerbook a few months ago now and it is a fine laptop; very useable, very attractive, superbly designed and very expensive!
BUT:
I had my first Powerbook replaced within a month due to a faulty screen and now the one I have has developed a dark area on the monitor and the hinge is sticking. Research on the web indicates I am not alone, not by a long stretch. Unfortunately Apple is not the benevolent customer-lover it would like us to believe and charges 35 for each and every customer service matter within the first twelve months. I hope the replacement I get is sound but I must admit that I wish I'd paid half as much for a high spec PC.
Don't get sucked in by the Apple charm, take a step back and consider.
An excellent piece of engineering combined with a truly elegant operating system and applications. I have owned laptops from HP, IBM and Toshiba and this unit takes the cake. Very fast, silent and well built. The airport extreme 802.11g is very fast and the bluetooth works well with the Apple wireless mouse. The screen is beautiful and the backlit keyboard is nice when you are sitting on the couch typing in the evening. I expect to keep this system for at least five years. Well worth the investment.
Purchasing advice: Spring for the 128MB of video RAM and upgrade the main RAM to 1GB. This will cost an extra ~$180 or so but it is an inexpensive way to maximize performance.
Being a technician on many products, I've come to learn that computers are tools. I came to work on Apple products through the years but recently my job functions required more hands on use of the G4. Mac Office 2004, which you have to buy on the side doesn't have a good ODBC plugin that makes it hard for people in finance to do their job. That is unless you buy a third party plugin for Office. Some of the features loaded on OS X are not fully developed and seem to be added just so they can add it to the ever-growing list of features. I'd say the top programs I use are Terminal, iTunes, iPhoto, Adium, Photoshop, Dreamweaver, and Quicksilver.

I'm sure I can get a lot of Mac enthusiasts to argue against me and flame me in every way possible. That's the beauty of this system; you actually have a fan base that most other systems don't. It's fairly easy to adapt to this operating system and hardware if you have patience. I think the nicest thing about this laptop is the DVD-RW that comes with it, Apple calls it a "Superdrive." Although you'd probably be recommended to buy Roxio's Toast program to burn cds. All in all you have to be ready to fork out some money when you switch.

Personally I love the G4, I have distanced myself enough to be very critical on some items but this is one product that doesn't have much criticism. Of course that is compared to almost every other system out there. They've embedded FreeBSD into the OS perfectly and makes it sound for developers to use and compile software. I do hope that in the future Apple fixes a lot of the minor glitches and becomes mainstream because this product is a very valuable tool.
My Fujitsu Lifebook (which I loved!) died on me w/a shorted out motherboard that was impossible to access to fix (w/out the help of few $100s just to open her up).  I found it just easier to purchase a new notebook than repair.

Yes, the Powerbook was an expensive purchase.  In retrospect, a 12" probably would have been fine.  I also don't know that I need the DVD burner - but I have it.

The speed is great.  Th 80G is nice.  The screen is superb.  Resolution is wonderful.  Set-up was a breeze, as was connection to my pre-existing wireless network.  As always, Apple's packaging and design are flawless.  The keyboard is wonderful (and I like the backlighting).

Testing out iDVD was fun.  'Star Wars' looked great on the screen (ok, maybe a 12" wouldn't have cut it for something like that).  Still lot more features to play with (iMovies, iPhoto, etc) that I won't/don't use everyday....but fun to have.

Security is pretty sound - and was even talked out of purchasing a virus pack by the folks @ the Apple Store.

Though I had an early version of a Mac, it's taking a bit of time to reacclimate to a non-windows unit.  I have some issues w/the Mac version of Office - but that is for a software review later.

Ok - so why only 4 Stars?  I've decided it's very tough to give technology prodcuts 5 stars.  I've done so in the past and been burned.  But I've also decided not to review them immeidately anymore also.  Had the Powerbook 2 mos and very happy w/it.  In my mind - 5 star worthy.  In print - I'll hedge my bets and stick w/ 4.
Sleek design, ease of use (Mac OS X is rock solid, stable and immune to all Windows viruses and spyware) and great for commuting due it's relatively light weight compared to Wintel laptops (although I have some friends who prefer the 12" Powerbook for the commute). The IT guys at work wanted me to use some behemoth IBM thinkpad, which I stopped using after a week due to poor battery life, weight and constant crashes. I've had no problems using this Mac in a Windows office. A great desktop replacement.
I have been your stereotypical gamer/geek/pc user since i was in 8th grade, and all the time have been deftly opposed to anything with an apple logo on it. I had always accepted Macintosh as a sort of "stupid person's computer," since we had used them in grade school to a)type things, b)play oregon trail on game tuesdays, and c)learn to type. Also, while growing up my friend's dad had a Performa PPC that he used to a)surf the internet (what little internet there was back then), b)taxes on quicken, and c)check his stocks.

Now fast-forward. I had just finished my first semsester of college, and i needed a laptop. At first i run to the nearest box store and pick up a thin and light HP notebook, which had respectable specs for what i needed. 60GB hard drive, 512MB DDR Ram, 1.5Ghz Centrino, and an (advertised) over 5 hours battery life. Wow! for only $1399, i grabbed it in an instant. I had it for 5 days. Right out of the box i booted it up and it ran as slow as my roommates 466 Mhz Celeron that we pulled out of a dumpster b/c he is a cheapskate. 10 seconds to boot up Office? C'mon! I had just spent $1400 on a cool-looking piece of plastic that get beat out by 5 year old celerons. Then that amazing battery life was actually around 2-2.5 hours. Wow again. All that low voltage technology and it can't even get past 3 hours? My god i needed something else. So i returned it promptly and started shopping again.

The School Bookstore has always had a plethora of apple products on display because they are one of only two apple dealers in the city (what, Bozeman MT is a small town!). They definitely looked infinitely more sexy than the Performa that my friend and I had grown up with (playing Gridz-- Yeeehaw!) I spent about a week researching this 1.5 Ghz Powerbook. about 19 of the 20 Amazon review gave it 5 stars or (if they could) higher. So i decided to spring for one, because of the Bookstore's return policy and the fact that i needed something before the next semester.

Even at purchase i was still skeptical of buying a mac, and at $2500, i thought, it better be a DAMN perfect computer.

I have had this powerbook for a week now, and i must say: PC users who hate everything apple: you just need to experience it. I thought i would regret the incompatibilities between XP and OS X, but instead, i spend all my time thinking to myself "Why the hell didn't MICROSOFT think of this!!!"  This is hands down the tightest software i have ever had the pleasure to use. OS X is not simple, it is logical. Unlike XP, there are never unavailable options because of your incompatible hardware, and best of all: no baloon info! When was the last time a PC user actually needed to be reminded that they had just removed their Usb Key??? Or, in case of a re-install of XP which i did more often than not, Usually an hour or so is spent making sure the OS worked with the computer as best as possible. OS-X works. period. No tweaking, no secret options to increase performance. OS-X is a PC user's dream! Imagine an OS, out of the box, that is already a finely tuned and stripped of its useless features and software, that doesn't crash, doesn't need drivers, doesn't need setting up, and best of all: WORKS!!! If apple can find an easier way to communicate this with the PC population, i'm sure they will have majority market share in a matter of years.

I love my Powerbook! I'm sure if you're reading this, you've read other reviews that go through all the "duh" features and battery life, blah blah. Actually, unless you will use this on your lap for very long periods of time (99% of the time it will be on a library table or airplane tray) it get warm(not hot) but i guess it gets annoying unless its cold out. Also, if apple can create a computer like this, they can definitely make a longer battery. i don't think 5-real life hours is impossible with the additional use of lithium polymer batteries to fill up any extra space inside (like the iPod battery) Also, the screen, when closed, is a wee bit wobbly. I want to see AIRTIGHT seals on the lid, but, again, this really doesn't matter. the 12" version is rock solid in this aspect, with the lid closing perfectly tight. I guess it's just an ailment of having a big screen. But these are very minor gripes for a guy wishing apple to create the perfect laptop. Although not quite perfect [yet] This is still far superior to any PC notebook on the market today. One more thing: two buttons and a scroll function on the touchpad. Seriously apple, even that crappy HP had that!

But, my minor issues aside, all you need to know is this: I hated macs, am a very literate PC guy (CCNA, A+ certification) who never thought he'd buy a mac. I haven't "switched over", persay, but my mac is now "my computer," and the pc is kept for stuff that doesn't work on the powerbook. Incredible Job, Steve Jobs! An to think, a month ago i was telling friends that Apple should drop computers and just sell iPods! This is NOT the case. Apple should be on top of the market with products like this. 5 out of 5 stars! I love it!
I may be baised towards Apple products ... but this is the best
I have been a Mac person for over 15 years now, and have owned a succession of Mac laptops. For the past 5 years I used a G3 which I loved, but software requirements being what they are these days I decided to move on. I purchased this machine 4 months ago after glowing reviews from many sources. And certainly it has some very fine features. It looks wonderful, is small and light and has pretty much every port and peripheral you'd need. Yet I am finding it increasingly difficult to live with. There are some minor irrating details such as battery life being considerably shorter than in the previous model. Heat is another problem - this machine not only gets way too hot to comfortably hold on your lap for any length of time, but I find that the heat seeps through the keyboard and at the end of the day I end up with numb fingers. The solution of course is to use an external keyboard, but that somewhat defeats the purpose. What really gets me though is that to my eye the screen on these machines is not sharp. The anti aliasing software gives every letter a blurry edge which you simply cannot get rid of. This is true regardless of the program you're using. Changing the settings on the main computer system has little effect. I've taken it to two different Mac shops and they told me that all of the screens are like that (true - I looked at plenty in the shops) and you just get used to it. Except I haven't been able to get used to it. Even more irritating is the fact that the only way I have found to get a relatively sharp picture is to use Virtual PC which must not use the anti-aliasing software. Much as it irks me I am now considering swapping to a PC so I can get a crisp picture. My suggestion is that before considering buying a G4 powerbook, go and spend some time in the shop typing a letter on one and see if the font looks sharp to your eyes. If not then don't buy it, because it does not improve.
I have simply one word for this machine. Wow

And yet, I have had this machine (with the upgraded RAM and faster hard drive and such) and I still contintue to say wow.

This is my first notebook computer, and being a high school student, i needed something fast, reliable, strong, and light. This machine suits the bill, and more. This machine is simply amazing. The super fast G4 1.5 GHz processor takes my Photoshop dreams and puts them into reality. Our 2.5 GHz Dell computers at school don't even stand a chance.

The OS is solid, and with little features like Expos, it just makes life a lot easier when taking notes and research at the same time. I can have Photoshop, iTunes, Safari, Entourage, iCal, and watch a DVD, and not even think twice about my machine crashing.

The case is simply beautiful. Everywhere I go, people just stop and stare at the case and the lit Apple logo and look in awe. The light reflected off of it is really something else. And it's so easy to clean!

Other things, like the two Ambient light sensors, are things that I would not have even asked for, but they put them in to make our life easier. My PowerBook really turns heads when the teacher turns off the lights for notes and my screen automatically dims down and my keyboard lights up. Even the teacher was dumbfounded at the first she saw it.

A DVD-R, CD-RW, 15in Widescreen Display, which is VERY easy to clean unlike other Windows counterparts, Two FireWire ports, Two USB 2.0 ports, super thin and light design (mine is 5 lbs and 1in thin, while other PC notebooks weight as much as 8-10 lbs and 1-2.5 in thick).

There is nothing that I can think of doing on this computer that other Windows machine can't do. Well, minus most of the games.

Despite the price, This is probably THE BEST notebook I can think of for just about anything. If you need a Laptop that can keep up with your day to day life, I strongly suggest getting one of these machines.
About 5 months ago my own Dell laptop up and died (thank goodness for that) so I finally had an excuse to buy a new computer. I had been seriously looking at the Mac for about a year, and now I had an excuse to get one. I bought the 15" Powerbook G4, and honestly, I don't think I'll ever be going back.

Perhaps the best place to start would be in terms of security. Macs are inherently more secure than Windows machines. You could say this is because no one uses the Mac, so all the hackers and script kiddies don't bother with them, or just because the Mac is better. It doesn't matter, because either way the statement is still true. Since I got a Mac, I completely forgot about viruses, worms, trojans, et al. I can check my email in peace, without worrying about the consequences. I don't have to put out extra money to pay for anti-virus software (even though I did at first, just to be safe. I've since found it to be unnecessary.) I don't need to worry about emailing a killer virus to my entire address book and then having my credit card info mailed off to the Russian Mob. Or whatever. It's just safer over here.

Ease of use is the next big area. Once you get to know the Mac (took me about one afternoon before I could comfortably move around it) you find that everything is so much easier. The statement "Everything just works" is so true, although for a non-user, it is sort of hard to explain. I guess a good example of this would be my printer. For my Dell laptop, if I ever had to reinstall the drivers for the printer, I'd have to go to HP's website, download a 50MB file, then go through the whole installation process (which seemed to screw up half the time anyway) before I could print anything. With the Mac, I just had to plug the printer in, and OS X immediately recognized it and set it up for me. To add to the impressiveness of this, all the necessary utilities and controls were there, just as if I had gone to HP's website and downloaded that stupid 50MB file.

If you're planning on getting the Powerbook specifically, I'll give you some of the advantages of the mobile Mac over one of the various Windows bricks you could get. At only an inch thick and 5.7 pounds, it is incredibly light compared to a Windows laptop of similar screen size and processing power. I'm a high school student right now, so carrying around a laptop in addition to the regular books and such can get make things pretty cumbersome. With the Dell laptop, it was like throwing a brick into my backpack. With the Powerbook, it's definitely still there, but it also definitely weighs a lot less. The battery life on the Mac is also quite good, with 3 hours being about the average, and 4 hours if you really know how to conserve battery (dim the screen, shut off Airport and Bluetooth, mute the sound.) You should almost always have enough battery to watch a full length DVD. I don't know if this concerns you, but wireless range with Macs also seems to be considerably better. I have a wireless network at my home and at school, and the Powerbook gets a much better reception all around than the Dell Inspiron ever did.

Lastly, there's the coolness factor. I've never met anyone who didn't stop to stare at a Powerbook, just to absorb the whole sight in. It's a design marvel of sorts, there really isn't much to complain about. Aluminum is a very nice touch as well. The backlit keyboard rocks if you do anything in the dark.
I purchased this laptop in May of 2004 to replace a PowerBook G3 (Pismo).  Overall, I have been extremely satisfied with it's performance, stability and feature set.  For those users looking for an excellent compromise between portability and power, this laptop should satisfy.

Pros:

- Large, crisp display that automatically brightens/dims based on ambient light

- Backlit keyboard that works very well in low-light conditions

- Excellent performance from a relatively low clock-speed processor

- Acceptable battery life (3+ hours during normal use, 1.5 hours during heavy gaming).

- Case is easy to clean and surprisingly resistant to scratches

- Every port and connection imaginable:  Bluetooth, 802.11b/g, FireWire 400/800, USB2.0, s-video, DVI, gigabit ethernet, etc.

- Lightweight, considering the screen size.

- Very stable; no "hard" crashes since purchase.

- Phenomenal customer and technical support and unusually fast turnaround times for repairs.

Cons:

- The bottom of the unit can get uncomfortably hot if the processor speed is set to "highest".  Most noticeably during heavy gameplay.

- Lid hinge tends to become stiff over time, leading to creaks.

Overall, a machine that should please both Mac-afficionados and curious PC users considering the switch to Apple.
Everybody has their own opinion about computers in general, whether you're a PC buff or a Mac buff, you have to agree that Mac's look much nicer than PCs.

Now in terms of the machine itself, it is great.  THe 15" screen is large enough so you can enjoy a movie, the aluminum (or titanium) is quite sturdy, though I have to say the portion of the computer where you rest your palm while you type takes a beating after a few months.  But if you were smart when you bought your computer and you have the warranty, they will fix that right up for you.

Now, since I am an audio engineer I use pro tools with this computer.  I just installed 1gig of ram, and never have lag issues with the MBOX. so i think for all musicians this works great.

ALso, i do a lot of graphic design on the computer, so if thats what you do, this is the best machine for you.  I have used PCs alongside my mac all my life, but when i'm doing "work", its always on the mac.  I only play games on the PC...

so if you're into cool looking electronics, you gotta have one of these!
I bought this machine principally because of the UNIX interface as I am usually disappointed with portable PC linux installations. Well this is worse. It worked fine for about a month then I did a routine software upgrade a recommended by Apple. Now everytime I use the mail utility or ssh to another machine, all open programs crash.

In short, the concept is good but the execution stinks.

Other design issues. Unix users need a three button mouse. No excuse for the single button on this machine.

It is too heavy.

It runs too hot. It will burn your lap after about 15 minutes.

I will shortly be sending this back to surplus and have my lab buy me a (much lighter) Windows machine. Maybe I will try a dual XP/Linux boot again...
I just bought the PowerBook 15" (1.5Ghz, 80GB harddrive). I switched from Windows (an HP machine running Windows XP). I've had the PowerBook for about two weeks now and all I can say is wow! I'm a photographer with about 40GB worth of digital photos. I use Photoshop CS extensively. The wide format screen is awesome for photo editing. The included iPhoto software is great. Way better than anything I've used on Windows (and I've used just about everything). The OS is rock solid. No freezes or crashes yet (unlike the blue screen of death in Windows I got on a daily basis). I would highly recommend a PowerBook with Mac OS X to anybody into digital photography. Also, when I'm at Starbucks or Borders with my PowerBook, there's definitely a wow effect. I always notice people checking it out.
After begging and pleading for about a month, I ended up writing a proposal to my father for a 15-inch PowerBook. When he was finally convinced a week-long wait for this baby seemed like forever. But when it arrived, Oh Wow. It was everything I expected and MORE! I got the Airport Extreme BaseStation which is a MUST-HAVE for any one who wants to get the most out of having a light-weight wireless machine. There is something so incredible about sitting on my bed with the wireless mouse, internet and printing and NO CORDS! Having a USB printer plugged into the base station is great. The aluminum exclosure is just as stunning as the screen. Just like another user said, It's the BMW of laptops. It's a fabulous machine and everything works seamlessly. I noticed I definite improvment in the iLife apps. Naming iPhotos has never been faster and video rendering is super speedy. Loves it! Loves it! Loves it!
Don't be afraid of taking the step and getting an Apple notebook.  The other ones aren't worth it.  I've had a Dell and a Toshiba, and both have failed me.  I don't even want to mention my grandma's HP.  Powerbook is quite simply the best.  Its design blows the mind, with no little doors or anything that could get caught on something.  The Apple Experience starts when you open the box.  Its incredible.  Apple is the BMW of computers.  Its beatiful.  When you finish calibrating the battery the way they say, you're ready to have fun.  The apple logo lights up in back.  You don't notice it, you're having so much fun.  A plenthora of the latest ports (Apple didn't bother with the old ports nobody will use), you can hook up your USB 2 and Firewire devices.  Inside Apple has given you the best software.  Dell will load your laptop up with cheesy shareware software, where you have to buy it after 15 days.  Apple gives you the finest--included.  iLife 04 with iTunes (manage music), iPhoto (manage photos), iMovie (edit movies), iDVD (make DVDs), and GarageBand (MAKE/edit music) blows away any software from the Windows world.  OmniGraffle is a really cool drawing program, and GraphicConverter is a great graphics program.  Mail, iCal, Address Book, Safari, and the other built-in apple programs are very nice.  Safari is better than Internet Explorer for browsing, and Mail is far nicer than Outlook Express.

Worried about not having enough software for Mac?  Forget it.  There's piles of high quality stuff for Mac.  There is literally nothing you can do on a PC that you can't do on a Mac, often far better.  Even with games, where the Mac is slightly lacking, you can get Command and Conquer, Warcraft 3, Myst, Age of Empires, and many more popular titles.

Mac OSX was rated the best operating system according to PC World magazine, and its not hard to see why.  I was smitten.  You will be smitten too.

Mac simply don't get viruses, spyware, and randomly crash right when you're writing the most important report of your career.  This is probably one of the biggest pluses.  No more blue screen of death.

The built in wireless was a great plus.  When I plugged in the mac, it found our wireless network instantly.  Did you know, we had not been able to figure out how to do file sharing with our PCs.  We plug in the mac, and it found our other PCs right then and there.  I was file sharing in minutes!

The backlit keyboard is sooo cool.  Its automatic, and it is just stunning.

Watching DVDs is great.  The battery actually lasts long enough to finish the movie, and the controls aren't fussy and impossibly tricky.  There's no CD tray.  Its a slot-loading drive (see picture in product description)

Overall, you can really tell someone was thinking when they made this computer.  What a winner!

I don't want to sound like a salesperson, so there are some cons:

-Won't run your windows software.  You will have to look around for some replacements.  Most of the commonly used stuff is built right in, so you can read (and create) PDFs, manage your digital stuff, get mail, surf the web, read Word documents, and much much more.  You may have to find some more specialized programs for Excel and Powerpoint files, Graphics editing, etc...

-ummm.....

-The mouse has just one button

-umm.....

-Mac OSX takes a little getting used to, but then you'll figure it out after a day or two

You will be sorry if you choose to buy a Wintel (Dell, Compaq, HP, Gateway, Sony, etc...)notebook.  When you spend the first 10 hours after you buy your computer on tech support, you will remember this review.  You have been warned.
As power users wait patiently for PowerBook G5, Apple gives us the most matured PowerBook G4 to date.

No major breakthrough here, but all are nice to have:

- Faster CPU: 7447A running 1.5 GHz vs. 7447 running 1.25 GHz

- Faster GPU: ATI Mobility RADEON 9700 vs. ATI Mobility RADEON 9600

- Faster SuperDrive: writes CD-RW, DVD-R, and DVD-RW at double the speed

- $100 cheaper

- Fixed various manufacturing defects that plagued previous generation (e.g., bad LCD)

All in all, these additions make up the fastest and most trouble-free PowerBook G4.

Still... there are things missing:

- Long battery life: although Apple specifies 4.5 hours of battery life, you will be lucky to get 3 (most will get 2 to 2.5 hours under typical use)

- Faster hard disk: although you can specify 5400 RPM hard disk as built-to-order option, it bundles 4200 RPM hard disk (not optimal for GarageBand and iMovie)

- High resolution LCD: year after year, the 15-inch PowerBook is still stuck at 15.2" running 1280x854 resolution; Apple should offer higher resolution 15.4" as an option for power users

- New Bluetooth 1.2: it includes older Bluetooth 1.1

- No digital audio output: most notebooks don't yet offer this, but Apple should

- Slower in most respect than high-end Centrino notebooks

If you need the best portable running Mac OS X today, this 15-inch PowerBook is it (unless you can comfortably carry 17-inch). But I wonder what Apple has it in store for the PowerBook G5 next year.
I've had this computer for almost three months now. I upgraded to the 128MB videocard and 1GB ram. I also installed Abobe Creative Suite CS, Office 2004 for Mac, Virtual PC 6 with Win2000 and Red Hat Linux, and Macromedia Stdio 2004. I also have lots of IBM-made Windows XP Pro laptops and workstations. Windows XP drives me nuts most of the times. As an Italian, I do appreciate beauty and aesthetics, and I certainly agree with Steve Jobs when he says about Microsoft, "They have no taste." When you compare the elegance of MacOS with WinXP, it's like comparing a Michelangelo painting with a six-year old kid's drawing. And I won't even mention the beauty of the machine itself or even the attention to details in the packaging of the unit.
 The OS is rock-solid. I may have Photoshop, InDesign, Dreamweaver, iPhoto open at the same time, and the OS hums through all that like a Lexus at 65mph on the I5. This my not be the fastest PC out there, but it certainly does not feel any slower than my 3.0GHz, 1GB, 80GB, 7200rpm IBM intellistation. It is surely more stable though (and quieter too). The thing is, this machine, unlike a Windows box, does not require a Norton or McAfee Internet security suite to bog down your system resurces. To give you an example, my virtualPC win2000 was fine until I installed McAfee Internet security suite, which slowed it down a bit (well, maybe five bits). It is actually amusing to use virtual Win2000 on top of MacOS. When you see the sloppines of Windows-based programs, unwanted balloon tips popping up all the time bragging about the new exciting features of the OS or warning you about a new virus and so forth, it is a pleasure to go back to Mac OS and just do whatever you need to do with ease. The Apple Mail program has a better spam filter than Outlook on my IBM. The machine goes to sleep in one second and wakes up from sleep in two seconds, and even when on, it's whisper quiet. When the processor is working at full blast, you can hear the noise, but it's still much quieter than my IBM Boeing-747-take-off kind of noise. Safari is fast and reliable, iLife is a pleasure to use, when inserting a previously seen - but unfinished - DVD into the slot, the DVD player asks you whether you want to start watching the movie from the beginning or from where you left off. Isn't that what every DVD player on the planet should do? Yet, not only do Windows-based DVD player not do that, they either have some of the ugliest interfaces in the software world (WinDVD) or install a lot of crapware on your system that makes ad windows pop up all the time (real player). Mac OS never crashed in three months of intensive use, nor did the applications, with the exception of Word 2004 (it does it all the time when selecting Italian as the language in the TOOLS menu... maybe Bill Gates does not like Italy) and iPhoto once.
 Switching from Windows to Mac was a walk in the park, I think I took 10 minutes to figure out the big picture, and one day to master it at an intermediate level. if you are a developer, you'll love the xCode and python programs too. They come free with the machine.
 The machine is not perfect, though; hence only four stars. Text looks crisper to me in Win XP than it does in Mac OS, even though Microsoft drives me nuts with its persistence in using small size fonts in this day and age. Sure, I know i can select extra large fonts in Display Panel, and I can change font size within specific applications, but it's still a pain in the rear and time consuming. Fonts on the Mac are already of the perfect size (Apple, unlike MS, seems to grasp the concept that we are not using 640x480 screens anymore) and a pleasure to read, even though they could be a bit crisper (that could be a subjective thing, though. Some people swear by the smoothness of Mac fonts...). BTW, you will have to know how to set up the Clear Font option in Win XP because it's not active by default, which makes text in Win XP horrible. Again, what is Microsoft thinking? Sloppy people. The second complaint about this powerbook is relative to the lid hatch that lets the lid pop open sometimes. I know there's a DIY way of fixing it. I just didn't go the Apple discussion board yet, to read how to implement it. overall, unless you are into gaming, you should definetly ditch Windows in favor of Mac OS. It will be like leaving the Venetian casino in Vegas and going to Piazza San Marco in Venice. When you see the real thing, you will be asking yourself, "Why was I at the Venetian in the first place?"
The presentation of this unit when it arrived was very impressive.  The packaging, the body, the little details that Apple has thought of were very nice.  However, I had wanted this machine mainly to do some digital photography work and had been attracted by the included software (e.g. iPhoto).  iPhoto does not compare to My Pictures.  It is cumbersome, difficult to file pictures in a useful way and tedious to use.  It might be useful to show pictures to your family in a relatively unorganized fashion, but with all of the other excellent slide show software out there that do a good job, you would think that Apple would get the hint.  And finally, when I loaded over 20GB worth of photos into Pictures, iPhoto went into some kind of spin where it never stopped trying to load the photos.  I was finally able to stop it when I dumped the photos.

I had this unit for two weeks and while I had it it froze up on me twice.  I decided that this was not something that I needed to have especially since for me this was a switch from Windows XP on an Acer which has worked very well.  Thus, I decided to retun the unit and am now waiting for Amazon to return my money.
Wow.  I just can't say enough good things about this computer.  I bought this laptop back in May 2004, and I have been doting on it ever since.  I am a college student majoring in Graphic Design, so the purchase of this computer was a must. I am generally a PC user, so I thought that the switch to a MAC may be harder than I would hope.  That didn't seem to be the case at all!  I learned this computer and all it's commands in less than one week - with the help of a good MAC book.

When it is delievered to your door, it comes in a beautiful case - it's like opening a brand new mini-car!  All of my friends were around and I felt like I was unwrapping the crown jewel of computers!  All of my friends knew how much this baby cost, so they were just as excited to see if my money was worth it!  Well, I decided right then and there that I would fall in love with this computer the second I hit the power button.  We were in awe!  Most of us being PC users, we found that MAC OS X was way beyond Windows XP -  in quality, solidness, and pure asthetics.

The software that comes with the computer is great!  I love iLife!  It helps organize all your photos and you can post them to a website in under 2 minutes!

When you decide to purchase this little beauty - a few suggestions:

 - Upgrade the Memory to 1 Gig - so many people say that, but it's not very affordable to upgrade RAM to 1 gig - but believe me, your computer will run so much more smoothly if you just invest a little more.

 - Buy the Powerbook Plan!!! - Phone support only last 90 days after you buy this, and when you are buying something with this sort of price tag, you need to take all precautions in safeguarding it.  The plan extends warranty and support for 3 years!

 - Office for MAC!!  Wow!  I love this version of Microsoft Office.  It's kinda strange, but I actually feel like this version of Microsoft Office is the ONLY version of Office!  It's wonderful!  Loads of features!!

When you decide to purchase this computer, you won't be dissappointed.  The screen is absolutely stuning (I have not had the problems a few people claim to have about white sploches on the screen.)  I love the back-lit keyboard!  It's just plain cool!  When you have this little beauty sitting on your desk or in your lap, you will be envied by all!  Especially PC users!!
Like it or not, I've used Windows/PC for the past 12 years. Macintosh occasionally appealed to me, but I didn't get it partly because it's expensive, partly because of compatibility. At work and  at home, I owned: Dell Inspiron, Thinkpad, Dell/HP Desktops, running Windows 98/2000/XP. Also I tinkered with Sun workstations running UNIX (I'm an EE guy and have a respect for UNIX).
 After 12 years of Microsoft (and blue screens), I made a bold switch to Apple Powerbook 15" with 1.5GHz/512RAM/80Gb, and I'm so happy with this system that even 5 stars are not high enough.
 - The sleek aluminum chassis and the wide screen generate Wow! effect.
 - This 15" machine is lighter than my old Dell laptop.
 - It's very quiet during operation, but the bottom side may occasionally become hot.
 - The keyboard has a good depth and touch, and the backlit keyboard is simply cool.
 - Using the built-in microphone, you can play the bundled 3-D chess game via OS X's voice-recognition. Isn't that futuristic?
 About software compatibility (from EE guy's viewpoint):
 - MS Office 2004 for Mac became my favorite patch of programs. Even better than the XP version - a very important factor in my decision to switch.
 - Math tools, especially Mathematica 5 and Matlab, run well on Mac.
 - Favorite design tools, Adobe Photoshop and Carrara 3, work well. After all, Mac was built for them.

 - There are tons of open source programs you can use: GIMP, A/G BLAST, ...
 - Some layout and CAD tools are not compatible. I have to use old PC. For those number-crunching jobs, however, I don't use laptop anyhow.
 As much as I enjoy steering this elegant silver machine, I love to navigate through the Mac OS X. As Sun's Bill Joy said during an interview, "Mac OS X is rock solid". I like the idea of using UNIX commands on my Mac, although I can do everything with the user-friendly Mac interface.
 Yes, Powerbook is more expensive compared with Dell and other PCs, but you get what you pay for: top-quality components, futuristic functionality, eye-catching design, and the enormous joy of owning a rock-solid elegant machine (like BMW!). You'll definitely like this one!
Oh the display is so bright especially when it REFLECTS glare from sunlight and interior lights so much compared to other displays.  It will also be hard to keep the screen clean because of the glossy surface. I Have 3 words to say about the display GLARE,GlARE and Glare.  Its like those projection TV's with shiny plastic screens.  But it does work in dim rooms good.  Also copying cd's to the harddrive is HIDEOUSLY SLOW!!!.  In fact, I had trouble reading homemade CD's that were easily read on other computers.  I ended up having to use an IOMEGA external USB cdburner/writer to copy those cd's onto my vaio. Im not sure if its the harddrive or the CD player, but my desktop computer is so much faster in copying files.  everything else seems to be ok though.  I wish the touchpad was bigger like in competing brands.  This is a low-end Sony, it compares to the compaqs and toshibas that go for 900-1100 dollars.  You pay a premium to have the name Sony on the computer.
This is the first time i bought something online that is so costly. So you can imagine i have done a good deal of research. Sony VAIO K23, indeed was THE BEST pick of them all, (I simply don't like DELL notebooks, all of them have a  monotonous look). I got it in 2 days. I am very much impressed with its look and the screen ranks it above all laptops available till date. you also get a bunch of useful softwares with it. I was concerned about the weight, but its really not that heavy. So it was a good deal at least for me.
In my review, I initially complained about the error in making recovery discs. I mentioned that I found out the problem had already been mentioned online. After calling Sony customer service, they decided to mail me the recovery DVD free of charge even though it would normally cost money if bought online. The expedient and hassle free response to my problem proves how Sony excellent Sony support has been.
No other complaints!
Except one thing, if this laptop is too heavy for you, go to the gym and work out.
This iBook is a beautiful machine.  Nearly everything about it is solid and well-designed, from the location of the ports to the mechanism that opens and closes the screen to the feel of the keyboard when you type.  The screen is very clear for a 12" laptop and the sound quality from the tiny speakers is perfectly acceptable by the standards of any other laptop.  And best of all, the battery is good for about five hours of use.

The white plastic case is not as flimsy as it looks--it is in fact quite solid.  My only complaint about the case is that it stains easily.

I received my iBook on a Friday, turned it on, and it immediately detected my wireless network.  I had to do nothing in order to get online.  It took me two days to get my Debian Linux and Windows XP PCs to find the same network.

The OS X user interface is very intuitive, especially for an Apple novice like me (I last used an Apple product about 15 years ago).  The free "Quicksilver" product extends the functionality of the Finder such that all you need to do is type the first few letters of whatever you are looking for, and it will find and open it for you.  Having struggled with the various incarnations of Windows for the past decade, I'm especially glad to know that OS X is Linux-based.

The hard drive is only 30 GB, and you'll fill that up quickly.  But you can always buy an iPod, or even better, you can get an external FireWire hard drive for $0.70/GB on which to store your media.

I don't know why you would pay twice the price for a PowerBook just to get twice the hard drive space and an aluminum case.  The iBook is a killer deal [...].  If you're in the market for a good, solid, easy-to-use notebook computer, the iBook should be at the top of your list.
I really enjoy this new 1.2GHz iBook from Apple.  The system is snappy, even with a 4200RPM drive installed.  I did a custom install of OS X to remove the extra printer drivers and languages, thus saving space on the 30GB hard drive.

The unit came with 50% in the battery.  I worked on running it down to 0% so I could put a full chrage and calibrate the battery.  It took quite a while before I could wear the battery out!  I look forward to seeing how long it will last.

The screen is super bright to me, in fact I have it turned down to about 60% as that is more comfortable to me.  I love the small size and the 12" screen isn't too small to me.  I've installed an extra 512MB DIMM to bring me up to 768MB.

OS X is clean and smooth.  I love how when an app needs your attention, the icon just bounces in the dock, it doesn't jump your attention to that mis-behaving application like Windows.  Reminds me of a bratty kid that wants mom and dads attention RIGHT NOW, LOOK AT ME!!!

With the rebate currently be offered, and the sub $1000 price for this unit, it's the best bang for your buck.  I'm going to try and use it to learn the Mac platform and a very reasonable price.
The new 12" iBook has everything you need in a super-portable laptop. It's 20 percent faster than the model it replaces and 20 percent cheaper, with a hundred-buck price cut and wireless networking included.

The iBook features a brilliant, small screen, 4+hour battery, 4.9 pounds, an array of fast ports, industry-leading styling and the best repair record in the industry, according to Consumer Reports. Reliability and service is especially important with temperamental laptops. Apple laptops also never come with the cheap integrated graphics you will find on similarly priced PC products.

There also are the usual MAC bennies: No viruses to worry about, no spyware, no pop-up ads with Safari, faster, cleaner, smarter software, painless connections to printers and networks, and the coolness factor to boot.
The iBook is really the best way to get started in Mac ownership.  It represents everything good about Apple hardware: it's attractive, efficient, and actually designed with the user - not just the specs list - in mind.  The ports are easily accessible on the side, the slot-load drive means that you won't have a tray that can break or become jammed, and the instant sleep/wake function from operating the lid is invaluable.  You might never have to completely turn the iBook off... just quit your programs and close the lid!

Also, this is definitely one of the better deals in genuniely portable laptops.  It has a very good blend of features and performance for $999 - and it's even better if you can take advantage of the Amazon rebate going on as I write this.  The only real laptop that compares is the Averatec 12" model, which falls completely flat in terms of video performance and battery life (Averatec claims 3 hours of life, where the iBook regularly gets 4+ in real-world use).

The only catch is the hard drive space.  That's enough for Office, a few games, and an iTunes collection, but consider this: if you got a 20 GB iPod and filled it up from your iBook, about two thirds of your iBook's storage would be nothing but music!  If you think you'll need anything more in the future, seriously consider the 14" iBook (with 60 GB standard) or custom-ordering a 12" iBook from Apple's own online store.

One last thing: I'd like to comment on D. Potts' review.  The current iBook will still enjoy the majority of the benefits of OS X 10.4, and does in fact do pixel shading.  It's just not as full-featured as the absolute-latest graphics chips.  But if you really, truly NEED every graphics feature supported, there's a 12" PowerBook waiting for you.
The iBook is a great laptop - especially for those who are interested in trying out a mac.  However, these laptops lack the minimum graphics card to support all of the features in the next MacOSX release (10.4) which will occur by May at the latest.

Which means that Apple is unloading these iBooks to clear their inventory of the substandard graphics card and will soon upgrade this system to a GeForce card that supports pixel shading.  Otherwise, MacOSX 10.4 will run slower on your machine because the graphics will be totally loaded under your CPU.  With future iBooks, the upgraded graphics card will unload the graphics to the GPU.  Huge speed difference.  You might want to hold out purchasing an iBook for a few more months.

This also could mean a total redesign of the iBook, but that is totally speculative.
This machine is not only beautiful, its so user friendly. I have no complaints about it aside from the fact that (and I bet this happens with any laptop purchase) the software that came installed on my computer took a bite out of my hard disk space (I paid for 30 GB and was left with 18.85 GB).  But aside from that, my display is wonderful, and from the moment I first turned it on I was automatically in love.  This music started playing and this cute animation came up welcoming me to the wonderful world of Apple (but not in those words, of course).  i'm a graphic designer,so this is the perfect machine for me.  Even with my 256 MB Ram that came with my machine its clean and smmoth sailin, although I do plan to upgrade it to like 768 MB when I get the chance.  But this is definitely worth the 999.99 I paid for it.  Not to mention the Airport Extreme that was included, giving me wireless nternet connection wherever it available. Great for those chilly nights when you end up hanging out at Starbucks or wherever.  If you are reading this review in order to buy this computer, plase do, you will NOT be disappointed.
Apple never cease to astonish its consumers. As if the former line of iBooks weren't good enough, they upped the ante with this new holiday line.

The new 12 inch model is the most appealing of all, mostly because of its low price: $999,99. For under a thousand bucks you get a fully equipped notebook with an upgraded 1.2 GHz processor (the most powerful of the previous line), a wireless Airport Extreme card built-in and a new suite of apps including Panther 10.3.5, iLife'04, 30-day trial of Microsoft Office 2004, Quicken 2005, World Book 2004 and two new games. What else can you ask for?

The 12 inch TFT display is so gorgeous and brilliant that you'll want to exchange your 29-inch TV for this beauty when watching DVDs and with up to 6 hours of battery life you'll be able to play for a long time without worrying about constant recharges. To have an idea you can watch the full Titanic movie (that's over 3 hours and 15 minutes) and still have some battery left!

The new 1.2 GHz proc. hasten the timing your apps will load compared to the previus model but you still should upgrade the memory to at least 512 to make good use of Panther without any hassles.

The best feature of all is the built-in Airport Card (a $79 value) meaning that you're online wherever you happen to find a hotspot right from the moment you take it out of the box. Sweet!

Bottom line: there has never been a better time to get an iBook. And with an upgraded processor, wireless built-in, a new suite of apps and all the technology we come to expect from Apple, all of this for less than $1000,00 you'll be cheating yourself if you don't get one of these beauties for Christmas. Guaranteed.
Anyone who knows Macs knows that this is a good machine.  Much more than adequate for non-power users.  My only disappointment was that I was concerned that a 30GB hard drive may not be enough.  It would, but it came with nearly 15GB already filled.  If you need hard drive space, get a bigger drive.
I was thinking about buying a mac for a long time. Finally after many discussions with collegues and friends I bought this computer.. and now I have just one word: Awesome.

- Everything on this computer is very well designed (good looking and functionabillity).

- It is very easy to use, and very reliable. Software is easy to install, and due to the OS (osX) is based on linux, applications rarely crashes (I had just one crash in 1 month).

I really love it, and I've seen that many scientists use this computer (or Power book) for stabillity reason.

I recomend it.. the osX is far ahead from windows.
Into my encrypted wireless network on first try.

Used it as a DVD player on long trip - stick in a DVD and it plays on its own just like it should.

Booted pressing "T" to startup as a firewire disk and transferred everything from my old G3 in very little time (and that was running the old OS).

Yes there are cheaper non-Macs but if your time has value then this thing catches up pretty fast.
When you're a grown-up, "toys" include notebook computers, and this is a honey. Between the combo drive and the built-in WiFi antenna, you've got just about everything covered, everything you'd want to do (homework? No, watch a DVD!) is wrapped up in one tight little package, and it's fast enough to run OSX, which is the best OS I've ever used, and I'm old and crusty. Battery life is always an issue with any notebook. And it's usually overstated. I'd look into buying a second battery if I were you.

I'm a dedicated Apple user, and I'd say that this notebook is a tremendous value!!!
With the switch to Intel processors coming in the next few years, I decided on buying the least expensive Apple laptop. For the money, it is a lot of computer.

When I got the machine I upgraded the RAM to 512MB, as 256MB does not run OS X well. (I've just heard, by the way, that 512MB is now standard in these computers.) The keyboard is great, and the trackpad is far superior to my old clamshell iBook. My screen is fine with no dead pixels, and I also like the small size of this machine. Smaller screened laptops with slower processors generally get better battery life, and after getting an average of 4.5 hours per battery in my old iBook this has a lot to live up to.

I bought an external DVDRW drive for this computer since it doesn't have an internal SuperDrive and am happy I did, as it saved some money and allowed me to get the 12" display. The other accessory I recommend is a Griffin iMic interface. It's a USB device that allows a microphone to be connected. The lack of the microphone jack is my only real complaint here, and they perhaps could have put one in if they had gotten rid of the 56K modem, which is something many users will never use.

With enough power for almost anyone, this computer figures to be my primary machine for the next few years, as I will be on the road quite often and will be away from my iMac more frequently than I will see it. Based on the few worksessions I've had with this machine, though, I may not even miss the iMac.
I just have to say that I do like this notebook and I enjoy using it. Personally I don't know a lot about computers I own a Dell desktop and I taught myself how to use it. I am finding that the transition from using a windows pc and a mac is not very difficult at all, most things work similar if not the same. I purchased this ibook so that I would be able to have a portable word processor and it does that. I've read reviews were people have said that it doesn't have enough ram, mb, gb etc. but just because most notebooks have more that doesn't mean that this one does come with enough, all I know is that it does what I want it to do and that it moves ten times faster than my Dell desktop. Now when I use my Dell I am so annoyed by how slow it is since I'm use to using this machine. The only problem I have is that sometimes when I am typing somehow my words end up moving to another area and I don't understand why that bugs the H.E (double hockey sticks) out of me. I also bought this machine because I like the way that it looks. Sounds shallow, so, I like pretty things and this machine has a beautiful infrastructure. I'm  so tired of seeing the start menu on windows machine the icons and etc. The outer aesthetics are gorgeous too. There's nothing wrong with appreciating pretty things.
I've always been a PC person, but became interested in an Apple after purchasing my iPod.  This is one of the best decisions I've made.  No crashing computers, no viruses and almost idiot-proof!
Just upgraded from a old slow Performa 6360 on 5/25/05 to this new OSX monster and am so glad I made the move.

The good about this ibook

1) Tiny
2) Super fast and super light!
3) Sleeps and awakes almost as fast as my PDA!  No PC laptop can boast about this!
4)  Boots up almost as fast as my PDA
5)  Really stable os. Much superior to os 9 and Windows
6)  The color is nice
7)  CD-RW and DVD rom drives (Something my old Performa lacked)
8)  USB 2.x ports
9)  Built in wi-fi.  The next generation of Internet access!
10) Tiger seems to be able to open about 90% of my old classic apps.
11) Much more I cant think of right know!

However there are some gripes, but these gripes can be expected with such a low end machine.  But needless here they are.
The bad about this ibook

1)  Lack of a built in mic port
2)  Lack of a built in IR port
3)  Lack of bluetooth
4)  Hard drive is way too small
5)  Internal mic is not the best
6)  No PCMCIA card slot
7)  Not much software or hardware on the Mac market and often  companies don't make their mac versions as fancy as their PC counterparts.  This is a major gripe that I have with Logitech which has put far less effort into their OSX QuickCam software than that of Windows or even their old, old quickcam mac software from the 1990's!

I have other gripes that I cant think of just know, but the gripes pale in comparison to the many advantages.

I received my new iBook just over a month ago, and in that time, I've experienced very few problems - the ones that did pop up were extremely minor, and had more to do with the software than the computer itself. I ordered my iBook with 512 MB if RAM and 60 GB of hard drive space, and these extras are definitely worth the money since having only 30 GB could fill up very quickly. My only complaint about the iBook so far is the fact that it gets warm with extended use, making it somewhat uncomfortable for me to place directly on my lap or to touch for very long - but that aside, I'm enjoying my new laptop very much, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a new notebook computer. This is my very first laptop and I couldn't be any more pleased!
My old laptop was a Compaq Presario 2100. It was getting a bit on the aged side so I decided it was time to upgrade.

Mac or Windows? Stupid question. I made the leap and got a Mac, a 12" Ibook to be exact (upgraded to a 60Gb hard drive and 512Mb of RAM).

I'm happy to report that I've been addicted for close to three weeks.

What I love:

1. Clean, elegant design. The slot-loading drive is mucho cool. And the Ibook's quiet. Very quiet.

2. 4-5 hour battery life, consistently. I watch a DVD and still get 2 hours more of battery life afterwards. Cool! My old Compaqs never got more than 3 hours when new. (My Presario 2100, was getting 1 hour 30 max on a full battery by the time I sold it.)

3. OS X Tiger. Tiger's way ahead of WinXP. No question about it.

3.1 Eye candy wise, it's stunning. (I like the way program icons on the dock jump up and down when they're trying to get your attention. That's attention to detail.)

3.2 The lack of borders. This is probably eye candy as well. But I love how, when you open a web page in Safari or play a video file using VLC Player (if it's not on full screen), except for the bar on top and/or the scroll bar, there are no other frames. I haven't seen that trick in XP.

3.3 Expose. I love the way you can call up all your open windows by pushing F9 to get a look at exactly what's running. I love that you can hide all your windows at a push of a button as well.

3.4 Dictionary. I haven't had much use for the dictionary. But, I have to say, the idea that I can push a combination of buttons and immediately get a definition of an unknown word on a webpage or an open document is way cool.

3.5 Dashboard. Ok, ok, Konfabulator has been doing this for a long time (and, truth to tell, Konfabulator's widgets are a bit cooler - but not by much). Here's the big difference though. Dashboard and all the widgets you want are free with your Ibook. Konfabulator is a $19.95 value.

What I like (warning, based on hearsay for now, that's why it's only "like").

1. No spyware, Adware and very little viruses. As a long time Windows user, I've gotten used to having Adaware, Spy Doctor, and Norton Anti-virus running in the background. OS X doesn't have the same problems (or so people say).

Here's what I do know, I've still to see any unwelcome pop-ups when surfing with Safari.

(But, I have to admit, spyware still scares me and I'm not entirely sure OS X is completely immune from spyware.)

2. System stability. I have not had my Ibook long enough to make a statement of fact.

What I do know, however, with Windows - and this covers XP, ME, 98 and 95 - I've had to wipe my hard drive and do a clean install at least once a year because Windows simply stopped working. (btw, in neither of those cases was it a hardware problem. The culprit was always Windows.)

I've heard no such horror stories with regard to OS X.

What I hate.

1. This remains true - lack of software. Yes, there are literally thousands of Mac titles out there. But, unfortunately, it will never be as numerous as those available on Windows. (I have not seen Half Life 2 for Mac, for example.) On the other hand, if you know what you want (and need) and it's available on the Mac, who cares, right?

2. OS X and Windows XP don't work together as well as advertised. For reasons unclear to me, I have been unable to get my HP printer (connected to my Windows desktop - I am not completely free from the Microsoft monopoly) working wirelessly with the Ibook. (I had no such problems with my old Compaq laptop.) And I've had problems with WPA and WEP wireless security as well - this time on a Linksys WiFi router also hardwired to my desktop.

3. Apple is more expensive (though this probably has more to do with the price-gouging practices of authorized Apple re-sellers where I live than with Apple itself. But I do wish Apple would impose a bit more price discipline on its authorized re-sellers -at least to the extent it can legally do so.)

Still, all-in-all, for beautiful design, the Ibook stands up very well indeed against all, except the most elegantly designed Windows laptops out there. (And even then, those elegantly designed Windows laptops are probably hundreds if not thousands of dollars more expensive than the Ibook.)

More importantly, OS X beats the pants-off WinXP any day of the week, including Sunday.

So what are you waiting for? Get a Mac already!
I made the leap back to Mac with the 12" iBook.  I read the reviews and talked to many people about it before deciding on the exact model.  I decided to get 60GB harddrive and add 512 MB of RAM.  I'm sitting in a hotel 3000 miles home working on my thesis...this computer rocks!
*Back for an edit*...
I was definately afraid of having to learn a whole new system - it honestly did take a couple of weeks to get used to, but that's it (and I'm not a computer person).  They're right, the mac system really is more intuitive than PC.  I'm done with the thesis and now am as fluent with mac as I was with PC.  I do recommend buying additional RAM, although I think the G4s come with 512 MB standard now.  A bigger harddrive is only necessary if you fall in love with your mac and never want to turn on your PC desktop again (like me).  Never gone wireless before?  Oh you will!  You'll be busting out your cool little iBook at every coffee shop, library and airport...then your wireless house!
i just got this computer today june 15, 2005 its absolutley amazing everything spectacular i would highly recommend this computer for students. It never freezes up. No virus or spyware this computer is great but windows has alittle more options but this computer is very good. Its better than my dell d600 laptop which has 512mb 30gb also 1.6ghz processor and it dosent even come close to this ibook this is GREAT
Overall the iBook is wonderful.  The only computer I've owned was the Mac 512k back in 1985.  Since then I've worked on various pc's in corporate america.  I struck out on my own just recently and needed to purchase a computer and decided on the iBook for several reasons;  price and the stability of the OS.  I like the iBook 12" but it's taking some time to adjust to it.  My previous pc was the Toshiba M100 and it costs roughly twice the iBook, so keep that in mind.  The factors I'm adjusting to are:

*  The iBook is 4.9 lbs, which is pretty light except when you've been carting around the 2.5 lbs Toshiba.  The Toshiba does this by having a shorter battery life and no built in drive.  But now the iBook feels like it'll throw out my back when I carry it around.

*  I'm disappointed with the fit and finish of the iBook vs the Toshiba.  The edges are a bit sharp and I'm getting used to the less precise feel of the track (mouse) button.  Also I'm afraid the white surface of the iBook will show dirt and stains more easily than the black and sliver colored surface of thee Toshiba.

*  Someone told me that I'd miss the right click button.  They were right.

*  I also need to get more RAM because the iBook is very slow with just 256k.  Originally I was going to get an additional 256k but now I'm leaning twards 512k or 1meg.

My gut reaction is that chosing an Apple computer was the right move vs a pc and that it's just a matter of adjusting to the new OS.  But I really wish that the Apple OS could be installed onto non-Apple machines.
Really enjoying this IBook. It's small and very light. I just took it on a trip and was glad to have it with me.  Mine came with a built in wireless card and I was able to utilize wireless hotspots on my trip.  Watched a DVD on the plane and listened to some tunes with ITunes.  Don't be fooled into thinking a 12" screen size is too small(everyone seems to want larger these days. The graphics are really sharp. The battery has been lasting about 4 hours. Best of all I got mine through one of those Offercentric sites.  My friend received one that way, so I signed up.  [...]

Enjoy!
I work with Mac OS X in my school, and I have found it to be very good! It is very convenient and easier to use than Windows (I'm not saying Windows is bad). I can write essays, get pictures, and go on the internet without being confused.

The iBook is no different than An iMac or eMac. I can do anything I want and store it anyplace since it is so compact. You can also have good functions on an iBook and it will look styling.

Tip: Don't use Appleworks. Get Microsoft office teacher student edition. Microsoft office is a lot easier to use than Appleworks.
Okay, all jokes aside. This Apple ibook is really one of the best purchases that I have ever made. I had a Compaq Presario 2500 with an 80GB Harddrive, 15" screen, 64MB graphics card, 768 MB RAM, with wireless internet and a 1400 by 1050 resolution. This Apple ibook beats the pants off the Compaq in almost every category.

1) Price: The Compaq cost $2,200 when I bought it a little over 2 years ago as opposed to the Apple which cost me $900 on eBay and came with 1.25 GB!!!! of RAM. Just for a side note, the Apple ibook that I got on eBay was 3 months old and I didn't actually pay $2,200 for the Compaq since there was a glitch on their website and I paid $500. Otherwise, nobody should buy a Compaq ever!

2) Portability: The ibook weighs 4.9 pounds as opposed to the 7.5-pound Compaq. In addition, the ibook is smaller by far and I can actually take it to class without having to hurt my back.

3) Noise level: The Compaq was so loud that I would hear a noisy fan almost every time I turned the machine on just to type up a paper or to browse the net making it useless for taking to class since people would stare at me. When playing video games such as Warcraft 3 or Counter-Strike the Compaq would run so loudly that I would have trouble hearing the game or thinking. The ibook is noise free when I type papers; browse the Internet, or most anything else. The only time that the ibook makes a sound is when a disc is inserted and the very quiet fan comes on only after a while of playing Age of Empires 2.

4) Screen size and resolution: The Compaq did have a better resolution of 1400 by 1050 compared to the ibook's 1024 by 768 but I have not really cared since the ibook's resolution is what I would normally use on the Compaq anyways. Just because it can have a better resolution doesn't mean that I will use it. Plus, I assumed that switching from a 15" to a 12" would be hard especially for a gamer but in fact it's not a big deal to me even when I play games on the ibook. The change from a 64MB onboard card to a 32MB onboard card was not great but when running games at the highest resolution, the ibook has a good enough display to make it worth keeping.

5) Battery life: The Compaq advertised 2 hours of life but usually put out 1 hour if I was typing or listening to music. The ibook advertises 6 hours and constantly puts out 4.5 hours of battery life while typing and a little less if playing music.

6) Operating System: While I thought that Windows XP was a step up from previous versions and that the Apple OSX would not be worthwhile I soon realized that I was wrong. My Compaq always had software compatibility issues with other devices, random warnings that I didn't understand, and random crashes while I was playing Warcraft 3 even though I had updated all of the software for the computer and the graphics card. The ibook does not crash, randomly scare me with warnings, and is very compatible with all my devices including my HP 1200 LaserJet. Also the Dashboard on the OSX is very useful with a calculator, stickies, a clock, stock tracker, weather, dictionary, thesaurus, and many other helpful tools that appear and disappear in one click. What's more the Spotlight lets you search your entire computer quickly and easily unlike windows, which is a pain and doesn't actually find what you're looking for.

7) Virus's, spyware, Worms, and other junk: The Windows system always lets all sorts of nasty programs into the Compaq through Activex or many of its other holes. The Apple OSX does not do that because every time that I download a program that could possibly give my Apple a Virus or some other nonsense, I am asked for a password. That is why Apple's don't have Virus's. I used to spend at least $60 a year on Anti-Virus, Anti-Spyware, and Firewall software, now I don't need to.

8) Compatibility: Apple works with most hardware out there such as printers, mp3 players, and mice such as my Logitech (don't buy the apple mouse). Most software such as Warcraft 3, Microsoft Word, and Age of Empires 2 can be bought for OSX.

9) Speakers: The Compaq's speakers do sound a little better when listening to music but only when it's really loud. Yet the ibook has great speakers that are of almost equal quality and may actually be better for listening to audio books or radio. My Compaq speakers had static when turned up all the way and went bad several times. The ibook speakers do not hurt my ears with static and have not gone bad.

10) Laptop looks, keyboard, and durability: The ibook is much more beautiful with its white sleek looking case and light up apple on the back. It doesn't look like it would scratch up like the Compaq or those silver Powerbook's. The keyboard on the ibook is better than Compaq's but worse than the Powerbook's not in terms of wearing out but that the Powerbook has those quiet keys. My Compaq had dirty palm prints all over its case from wear and this white ibook is doing much better but that may be because I've had it for a shorter period of time.

11) Harddrive space: I had 80GB on the Compaq and have 30Gb on the ibook but I still use only 15GB on both of them. So what does it matter whether I have 30GB or 80GB?

If you're thinking about getting anything besides an Apple (including a Dell) go for either an ibook or a Powerbook. If you're making the choice between an ibook or a Powerbook, consider this: The Powerbook has a 64Mb graphics card (32MB in ibook), a better screen resolution, a faster processor (1.2 vs. 1.5) but is louder, hotter, more expensive, and has 90 minutes less battery life than the ibook. Check out the Apple discussion boards for yourself. I hope this helps and don't hate the Apple, hate the Game.
I really love this laptop.  It's small and sleek and very light.  I recently brought this laptop on a trip with me and just slipped it in a protective sleeve and into my carry-on tote bag with my other electronics.  It also fits well on your seatback trays as opposed to some of the bigger laptops, especially in those tight airline seat spaces.  Play CDs, watch DVDs and play any electronic game you want on your flight.  The battery is generally good for 3-5 hours depending what your running.

I've always had Macs as a personal use computer and was really debatiing getting a regular PC since like most people, I use Windows in my workplace.  However, after seeing this one in a store and then the great deal I could get from Amazon with a (...)rebate and 2 day shipping through my membership in Amazon Prime, it was a no brainer decison to continue my loyalty to Apple computers.

Of course it includes all the perks, like most Mac packages do and is up to date technically including cellular connectivity if you choose.  Please note you need to purchase an AirPort Express Base Station and an AirPort Extreme Card to use the cellular feature.  This Mac model does not come with the AirPort Extreme Card installed.

All in all, you really get a lot of bang for your buck with this product!
I had a 15" Dell Inspiron laptop that just went out of its extended warranty, and I wanted to buy another laptop on MY terms, rather than scrambling to get a new one when something bad happened to the Dell. When I saw the price of the 12" iBook and looked at the included programs, I realized that the iBook is the perfect laptop for me.

1) I am always on the run. The iBook is light and tiny. It's a pleasure to carry about, much easier to actually use on my lap than my Dell was.

2) I do browsing, word processing and desktop publishing, mp3s, and digital photo tweaking. That's pretty much it. On my Dell I had a hodgepodge of software that didn't work together. The iBook's iLife suite of software works together and is included along with Appleworks with the iBook at no extra charge. You can get a cheaper PC, but honestly, I don't think it's cheaper once you factor in the software you get and the quality. You are not getting a cheap processor like a celeron and a dumbed down OS like XP home.

I am not saying that macs are better than PCs. I like my Dell fine. I am just saying that for the average computer user who needs a laptop that packs maximum value for the money in a small package, you can't beat the iBook.
This is a great computer.  Sure you can get a laptop cheaper, but it will run windows...who want's that?  Apple has a great machine here.  It's fast, portable, and it just looks cool.  Get the 512 upgrade though...you'll use it!
The iBook G4 is simply awesome! I am/was a windows fan, born and raised. I had expience with Macs and promptly labeled it as the stupidest operating system ever. (I mean come on no rightclick?) Although as I began my quest for the perfect laptop I soon found apple's iBook with amazing reviews. Still, undaunted by the good reviews, I searched Dell, Sony and all the other Windows laptop makers. Oddly all the Windows laptops I found for $1000 were HUGE, ugly, and had very little memory. To even find a good laptop you would have to spend an upwards of $1500. I finally, with tail between my legs purchased the iBook, promising if it sucked I would return it. I soon found the Operating system to be clear, and easy to understand... Even for a Windows user.

  The iBook is another Home run from Apple. It's sturdy white biuld is perfectly Fung Shui and stylish. I would reccomend upgrading the memory for $75. This laptop simply has the most bang for your buck, and the new operating system Tiger is a great freebie as well!

  I found no problems with the operating system, installing the programs, or iDVD. Ths computer rocks!
i loved my iBook. its clean and easy to use. there are no popups when surfing the internet and no worry of getting viruses. the only drawback i can think of is the iDVD which is locked to your preferred region. i hope they had it in multiregion so i can play all regional dvds.

but overall this is a good buy. if you've tried mac you'd never want to go back to Windows.
Let me begin by saying that I've never used an Apple before. Been a Windows user all my life.  I was in the market for a laptop and was looking around.  I had many choices lined up: Dell, Fujitsu, Gateway.  One day I was in the mall and went to an Apple Store.  I was sold.  I purchased an iBook on the spot.  This machine is fantastic! I don't know why I didn't switch from a PC to a Mac sooner.  The Mac OS X is simply the most stable and intuitive operating system I have ever used.  I'm doing more on my iBook than I ever did using my PC.

If you're in the market for a laptop I would highly recommend this iBook. If I haven't convinced you here are a few other observations.

The slot loading Combo drive is superb.  I don't know why other PC manufacturers don't use the same setup.  It loads like the CD player in your car.  Truly innovative.

The Mac OS doc is so much more intuitive than the taskbar in Windows.

Aiport wireless that actually works with great range.

The computer is fast with its 1.2 Ghz CPU. I would, however, recommend purchasing another 512 MB of RAM.  That will keep the machine flying after you add all of your programs.  All in all this is a superb laptop! I only wish I would have switched to a Mac sooner.
This apple is the best in the whole wide world! It never crashes!

Seriously! My friend was at a convention , and they were going to pay ANYONE 10,000 to hac in a mac. NOBODY could do it!

Plus, the ibook is so well designed!

When I take it out of its bag, you won't even begin to believe the stairs that I get!

I love that Apple pays attention to detail. When you close the ibook, it automatically goes to sleep, and it dosent hurt anything. You can leave it asleep for weeks if you wanted to! I wish I could use it at school. But I can't.

I am actually typing this right now on my ibook.

It's got great features.

I purchases this apple, because I was tired of my PC failing all the time.

I was tired of it.

Who cares what your friends think. Buy yourself a mac!!!!!!

(I got mine on Ebay, brand new, for $860)
Pro's:

Great screan

can hold 1.25 GB of ram.

great size

great for microsoft office, dreamweaver

battery life is good

Con's:

sucky trackpad

there needs to be in other colurs

could be a little thiner
The iBook is simply cool. Period. It's a great little package and even the power supply is a pleasant alternative to "the brick" of PC laptops. It was easy to set up, recognized a wireless network without any problems and was up and running. Apple finally caught up and added scroll to the touchpad of the Power Book but apparently does not plan to add it to the iBook. There is only one mouse button leaving this PC user always wanting to right click for context-specific menus.

Wireless range was surprisingly poor compared to two HP laptops and data transfer speed decreased dramatically as the signal grew weaker. The cool, click and lift keyboard provides access to check the wireless antenna but that does not help the range and speed problems.

Base memory is adequate but run an MS Office app and it grinds the drive like a Bunn coffee grinder. Bump up the memory by at least 512MB.

Printing is still the Achilles heel of Apple. The company has always sought to do cool graphics but printed output is still an afterthought. Printing on a Win network creates problems. It can see printers andinstall them but it cannot access them unless they have an IP address. Shared printers accessable on a Win network will not work with an Apple. If that is not a concern, this is the machine for you. If you must interface with hardware on a Win network you might want to reconsider.

Apple is still very parochial and tech support backs up when they hear that there is any hardware other than Apple being used. Blaming printers, routers, etc., is not very helpful.

Despite these drawbacks the iBook is still cool and a great starter computer. The price with added memory brings this entry level comptuer up to the price point of a near top end PC. Battery life is as advertised at nearly six hours of realtime use with wireless networking in use and the computer barely gets warm. No PC can match that without a bag of aux batteries. The iBook is worth its premium price just for the "cool factor" and it will be up and running quickly.
After reading all of the reviews I have come to the following conclusions.

1: Apple's operating system is light years ahead of Windows

  XP or Linux.

2: You will need to purchase the extra 256 megs of RAM and the

  60 gig HD.

3: Unless you want to really screw up your computer, forget

  trying to outsmart the engineers at Apple and buy Apple

  products or approved Apple products.

4: You will never have a virus. It's impossible to get one!

  The nature of the operating system makes receiving a virus

  impossible.

5: The system will almost never crash and is easier and more

  pleasant to use than any other.

6: Everything works seamlessly.

7: For this convenience and superiority you will pay more up

  front for everything and less on the back end. Quality costs.

8: Ben Franklin said that he always bought the best and most

  expensive item. It is always cheaper in the long run.
Simply, I could not ask for a better computer. I have the 12" and am completley satisfied with the smaller diplay.
I've owned my ibook for over a year, and here are some of the most important points:

1.  My ibook almost never crashes.  It has crashed once in over a year of constant use, and I was using a Microsoft program at the time. :-(

2.  My mac does not get viruses/adware/spyware, and I can quietly chuckle whenever anyone tells me about their virus/adware/software problems.

3.  I'm so tired of hearing people say that mac's don't have viruses because there are less of them.  IT'S NOT TRUE (and even if it were so what?  I'll go with the less popular, but definitely more secure option).  The reality is that apple does not allow programs to install on the root without the user entering a passward.  So everytime you download a program that needs access to the root you will be asked for your password.  You can however download as many files (anything that requires another program to run it) without entering your password).  Viruses need access to the root of your computer, so on a mac you would have to be stupid enough to enter your password to run a virus.

4.  Things really are easier on a mac (and I use a PC at work, so trust me, I know).

5.  The iLife programs are beautiful.  You can organize photos, download tunes, create music and movies with a simplicity that is amazing.  Nothing even comes close on a PC.

Read the reviews.  What a great computer.
I am absolutely in love with my iBook.  It's got great battery life, is lightweight, has a beautiful screen, and the OS is wonderful!  I highly recommend getting the 60GB hard drive and at least 512MB of RAM.  This makes things run smoother.  I love the wireless...I can go anywhere and get connected - unlike any PC I've used, where it's difficult to figure out how to connect to the WiFi.  I've used iTunes for a while, but I just started using iPhoto, and it's easy to use.  Just a couple of minutes and I had it figured out - I can't wait to see what else it can do!

I use a 3-year-old 15" PowerBook G4 at work, and I was concerned I would be disappointed in the 12" iBook screen, but not at all!  For everything I need to do, this laptop can handle it.  I have never been so excited about using a computer, and I've never been so interested in learning more about what it can do.

As far as the OS goes, if you've used a PC all your life, as I have, OS X is easy to get to know.  An hour or so, and I was moving through it easily.  Things are named a little different ("Get Info" on the Mac as opposed to "Properties" on the PC) but things just work better in OS X.

I highly recommend this computer, and I recommend the AppleCare, too.  I've not had to use it yet (knock on wood), but it's smart to have coverage.  For those people who rated the iBook badly, I figure either they had a stroke of bad luck, or more likely, they're anti-Mac and wanted to have a bash session.  Either way, I'm trying to convert all my friends...they don't know what they're missing!
My dad has been gaga over mac since the original 512k. I used to use Apple all the time. I liked the old Macs, but went to Windows when I entered "corporate world".

I got this 12" iBook because my Dell laptop SUCKED. It was really heavy, didn't have built in WiFi and I was tired of the spyware and pop ups that made my Dell run so SLOW!

I bought this iBook in December and I freaking *LOVE* it. It works seamlessly with my iPod (which is the best piece of technology I have ever purchased). The iBook has a great DVD player, awesome Safari web browser. Ok, the screen sucks, but I can live with that.

This laptop is awesome for me. I can do email, surf the web (wirelessly and with great range), work with digital photos, burn CDs, watch DVDs, make music with GarageBand (cool program) and video chat. Hey, $1,000 is cheap for a laptop that can do all this and is light enough to easily bring anywhere.

My only regret is that was a cheapo and I didn't pay the extra money to buy the one with the bigger screen. I know for next time.

Hey Apple...I'm baaaaaaaaaaaaaaack!
With all the hoopla surrounding the Ipod, I somehow managed to delude myself into buying this piece of junk a year ago. Here are my observations:

1. Apple will forever remain a niche producer of computers simply because they have this obnoxious habit of gouging cutomers. Every Apple accessory is almost 30-40% more expensive and one generation behind. Case in point being the combo drives (optimistically called 'super') and the terrible godawful screen.

2. The Base Station (or the router) has a much shorter range than my Belkin 54Mbps G router and costs 3 times as much.

3. There is a reason why most Apple owners (including myself) will fervently advise you to get extended Apple Care - You will most definitely need it. Most Dell lappy owners (and I have owned/used 7 laptops extensively -over 3 months each) and none have needed the kind of attention this guy needs - not even close. Local apple repair service is expensive.

4. OS X is a work of art - and the UNIX spine is a joy to behold. It is absolutely the best operating system I have ever used - hands down. I come from a old school UNIX background - and using ls and ps is a way of life. The only problem is that I am unable to enjoy this brilliant OS with such a crummy screen and underperforming rickety hardware. I run a server farm and compile various linux distros regualarly - compared to any consumer linux version, OSX is absolutely magnificient. XP cannot compare.

5. Speedwise, the only comparable advantage Macintoshes enjoy is for video. If someone has very little use for advanced rendering capabilities, one should seriously reconsider buying this machine.

6. So far, I have called Apple Service 7 times in the past 14 months. For the record, I currently own 3 laptops (Toshiba M2 and a Dell 700M- all bought in the past year) - and I have not called customer support at all. Come to think of it, these 7 times are more than all my previous support calls combined.

7. Most Mac Ibooks are extremely picky about the type of RAM they use. Mac owners like to call this 'bad RAM' - but without going into technical details - this smacks of gross negligence in Apple's design. This is akin to a car company making a car that runs on only premium gasoline.

8. No free Office suite will ever come close to Microsoft Office, and the Macintosh platform is no exception. Mac Office is very nice, and there are zero compatibility issues.

For those who are still interested in this machine (and OS X), I would recommend the dell 700M(with win pro SP2 and Antivirus). Much better screen, responsive keyboard, standard hardware and literally thousands of applications. If you are still interested in the Apple platform, the new Powerbooks should be given serious consideration.
Apple makes some of the best computers in the world.  Many years ago this was one of them.  Today it is an outdated piece of plastic.  I bought this computer about four years ago and it was low-end then.  I just replaced it because it crawled like a slug.  I guess in order to have a "low priced" computer Apple figures it can just keep selling it's most out of date systems until people catch on.  Oh well, I recognize that like any big company they are in this for the money.

The only plus I can give it is size.  If you don't want to use a computer and you need to keep it in a small drawer, then this may be what you are looking for.
I was wondering about words like "crash'. they seem like a bad memory after I stopped using a Windows based suite of desk and laptops three years ago. I normally changed - had to change - my laptop every year but I cannot see any need for this at the moment. The iBook is a superb workhorse used for e-mail at home and at hotspots every day. It is by my side at all my lectures used to show DVD and CD ROM MOV files from my research, and for preparing reports. Finally I enjoy it for watching DVDs on the train. I will for safety sake get another in a few weeks because I need to ensure i have a back up in case it gets dropped or stolen. the older iBook will then go in for a well earned servicing which it has never had in 3 years.
Let me qualify this review by making it clear that I am not a Mac user. My only experience with Mac's is a few mins spent each time I visit Apple store. I am writing this for those thinking of a switch from XP to Mac. I know it will be unpopular with Mac fans but hope it helps you XP users make the right decision.

iBook pro's,
1. It looks sleek, smooth and sexy. Nothing in PC world is this well designed.
2. No weekly patches coming from Redmond to apply.
3. No anti-virus or anti-spyware needed (?)
4. Longer battery life than PC laptops but not by much.
5. Can't really think of anything else other than the different and coolness factor.

Con's,
1. Screen, screen, screen. The 12" pbook/ibook just look awful with Mac OS X's anti-aliased fonts. XP's Cleartype seems really really clear in comparison. (Search for "Quartz Extreme" for more details on Apple's website)
2. Need to spend $160+ to put in 1GB RAM (in contrast XP runs similarly fast on just 512MB, about $30 expense for an extra 256MB stick).
3. All accessories are extremely high priced. How about $60 for a mouse?
4. No upgrades, everything except RAM slot is very hard to reach. 2 dozen mini-screws before you reach hard disk!
5. Need to buy new softwares, I have almost everything needed for XP already.
6. Non-scrolling & single button touchpad.
7. Paying atleast 30% premium compared to similar hardware with Wintel laptops.
8. Stuck with propreitary things Apple does, no innovation or competetion like in PC world.
9. Need to buy Apple's extended warranty because very few people can open or repair it. And laptops can't be fixed at home unlike desktops.
10. Lots of softwares and devices just don't work on Mac.

>>What good is a laptop that would give you strain with its tiny fancy fonts?

>>What good is wasting your hard earned money for nothing special?

>>What good is a fancy laptop if it can run only propreitary software from Apple and very little else?

In short, don't fall for that iPod "halo effect" that Wall Street analysts are talkin about. The iBook/Powerbook look very good but are no good for most XP users, unlike iPod. XP itself is very stable by now, just needs lots of patches/updates. Don't waste your time & money on this.
I bought this model last October. I have been using PC for ten years, my wife using Apple for 5 years. The ibook is cute. However if you check apple's official forum, you will see there are still lots of problems with ibook. My ibook sometimes wouldn't start up. After trying some key combinations according to the manual, it would work, well, not always. Sometimes the caplock key would just die there. As soon as the project finished, I will send it back to Apple for replacement. I have several desktops and notebooks (PC), they are more reliable than this ibook.
I ordered this version of the iBook G4 (12" screen, 1.2 GHz, 30 GB hard drive, 256 MB RAM) because of a variety of reasons.

1.) I wanted extreme portability, and purchased this because of the compact size and light weight of this notebook. Not only is it compact, but it is durable too, as the outer casing is made of a sturdy plastic and the frame is a strong, durable, aluminum.

2.) I wanted the ability to access wireless hotspots while traveling, and/or around my home and office. The built-in Airport card allows me to do just that, with exceptional range.

3.) I was tired of using the Windows interface, and wanted an operating system that is easy and that logically made sense. This iBook came with Mac OS X Panther installed (Edit: I am now running OSX Tiger on it, with no problems). Fast, easy, and reliable. That's all I ask for in an OS, and what everyone should expect. If you are not familiar with Mac OS, then it will take a little getting used to, but it is not difficult.

4.) I needed something basic. I use my iBook to access the internet, download songs from iTunes, email to friends and family, write short stories and poetry, some spreadsheet work, and play a few games. This iBook does the job. (for gaming, I do recommend a RAM upgrade, from the basic 256 MB.

It boils down to this: Simple, portable computer that doesn't take up a lot of space, and doesn't cause a lot of angst in terms of repairs, installations (software and hardware), and is simple to use.
Bought an ibook and when i cleaned the screen with plain water and damp rag it left many small white spots.

Calling them was terrible. Can't get an RMA and it's only 2 weeks old.
I am a teacher in a high school and we just got ten of the small white plastic IBooks with the G4 processor and three of them had the display screens go to black right out of the box.  It is a logic board problem and covered under warranty but what if it happens after the year is up?  These logic boards have had to be replaced.  I've heard this is a problem and was fixed on newer models but these new ones have the problem so I don't know what to think.  I was going to purchase one for my daughter but now I'm having second thoughts.
iBook 12" is the best value for your money notebook.  If you ever wanted to switch or try Mac OS X this is your chance.  at $1000 this little notebook does wonders.  I have been a Windoze user for the past 8yrs and coming back to Mac has been the best thing I've done!  The OS is so stable and user friendly its amazing.  No spyware/virus/trojans/etc... to worry about on the Mac OS X (not yet at least) and the Safari browser is wonderful as it blocks 99% of pop-ups and is fast!  As for the specs of the 12" model its great for someone just coming into Macs.  The 30GB (its actually 27GB) HDD is small.  You won't be storing many movie files (iMovie/iDVD) so if you plan on doing ANY video editing this is not the notebook for you (look into the 14" model w/a Super or the new Powerbooks with the super).  You can store music files, regular apps but nothing major.  You MUST upgrade the RAM to at least 512MB total.  Things will run a lot more smooth if you do.  256MB is decent but it gets choppy at times.  For an all around computer this iBook 12" is perfect.  The screen size may turn off some people but its sharp as can be.  The portability factor is a plus as its thin and lightweight.  If you plan on storing lots of huge files, video editing, playing graphic intensive games, photoshop, etc... this may NOT be the right notebook for you.  But for an overall everyday computer this will be for you.  If the screen size turns you off you can always hook it up to an external CRT with the included adaptor.

This is a very good notebook and for the money its a bargin hands down for an Apple!  Highly suggested.
I recenlty purchase the iBook out of the curiousity of Apple since I read a lot of reviews about how great the machinee is. But after I tried out, I have to say it is not that great.

The OS X claims that it is unix base and seldom crashes. But when I use some Java based chatrooms, it does crash.  It also crashes when multiple applications are used. it maybe the small rams that comes with it. (256MB). The dock is good, but it gets too complicated when you have a lot of windows open. and they stay there if you don't close them. It gets kind of confusing sometimes.

For the hardware, it is a beautiful machine. But there seems to be missing a microphone plug. I happened to need a webcam. But it is hard to find compatible webcams for mac. Most compatible ones are expensive, of course. It seems like a lot of mac related products are more expensive than windows products. So this will not be a low cost machine to maintain. I was pretty frustrated with the search for a compatible webcam. I really don't wanna think about other peripherals I want to buy in the future.

Maybe it will gget better when Mac is more popular. But for now, it is probably better to wait for a bit longer.
I am a long-time user of Apple products but have got to say that I am so happy with my recently purchased iBook (12", 1.2GHZ, 256MB RAM - Upgraded to 768 - running Panther 10.3.8) that I cannot be thankful enough.

I was a Windows user for many years - since 3.1 - and the comparison between even modern windows machines (I purchased a custom Dell laptop recently for a boss and had to set it up for him so I have a very good comparison point) still comes down to the blessing that Apple is the designer of the hardware and OS.  The integration is seamless and powerful and using OS X is a breeze.  I have never, using OS X since it came out, had a "crash" or the blue screen of death.  Never had viral problems.  Never had worms.  Never have to deal with any of that craziness like spyware that many novice windows users believe is 'normal' for using a computer.

I converted a company that had 10 PC's and 2 Mac's to become an 11 Mac and 2 PC office.  It happened naturally as many of the other "power users" got sick and tired of having to have I.T. come out to support them or having to spend many hours on the phones with tech support.  That is simply not part of living with a Mac.

This Mac is speedy, very simple to operate, the wireless is a wonderful thing - never having to make settings on it is the bomb!!!  I can go anywhere - for instance, on Friday to Panera Bread - and if there is wireless it will automatically ask if I want to join and it remembers the network so that the next time I am nearby it is already logged on by the time i'm opening it.  Cool.

OS X is very well integrated with the computer.  And having an OS that is UNIX based ("under the hood") has opened up the doors to tens of thousands of shareware and free programs that are wonderful productivity tools - available out there for you to download.

Cannot say enough about it.  As to using in an office - where I used all of my Macs until recently - it works perfectly on a windows based network and with MS Office other people hardly ever even know you use a Mac.  Ha ha. Also, don't forget, there are some AWESOME alternatives to MS Office on the 'net for FREE - yes, FREE.

Apple's new iWork setup is perfect for a home or small business user.  Many people would be better served spending the $79 on this package than the $300-400 for MS Office because Pages is simple to use and has great templates - and it can save easily to PDF or DOC or other formats to share with Windows.  Keynote, Apple's version of PowerPoint, is beautiful and very easy to use and has many transitions that are much nicer and more professional looking than PPT has.

So, overall, i'd say if you're trying to decide on a laptop that you will be happy with the iBook model here.  I have had another iBook and loved it and was thrilled to upgrade to this beauty.  I know i've got many years ahead that it will work great (another wonderful Apple trait is that you do NOT need to get a new machine nearly as often as a PC because OS updates and changes work great several generations back - I have several "old" macs running OS X Panther just fine, thank you).

Go for it!  You will not be disappointed!
I have been a diehard Windows user since the 3.1 days and never imagined in my wildest dreams I would ever own a Mac computer.  Well, after seeing them firsthand when I used to work for CompUSA, I finally decided it was time to switch.  I am SO glad I did!  I had the IBook out of the box and online in 15 minutes!  It took Windows that long to boot up and start the configurator!  OS X is very easy to navigate around that, aside from a few growing pains, I have been able to navigate like a pro.  I do miss the scroll button on my mouse, though I can live without that.  I love the sleep mode!!!  When I first heard of it, I had my doubts knowing how it never worked on Windows machines, but after having my IBook almost a week, I haven't had the need to shut it fully off yet.  I close the lid and come right back where I was!  I know some people take this as a canned motto, but it just works!  I tell it to do something and it does it!  That's exactly what I expect out of my computer!  Battery life is excellent and the built in Airport Extreme is faster I think that hardwired broadband internet.  Purchase this notebook and you will not be disappointed!
Alright, I should first mention that I don't actually own the 12" iBook G4, but I have owned the 933mhz 14" iBook G4 for a little over a year now.  I just decided to post a rave review for the iBook G4 series in general, and I feel that the new 1.2ghz 12" iBook is the greatest deal for anyone looking for an affordable notebook computer.

For the first computer purchase I ever made with my own hard-earned money (and for my first mac), I couldn't be more pleased with the iBook G4.  I remember looking around at a number of PC notebooks that had similar, or even "faster" specs, but decided to fork out a little more for a piece of equipment that oozed quality.  I also just wanted to try a new operating system (Not that I particularly dislike Windows, but I find it kind of boring and it makes me feel like I'm doing tedious office work.).

I'm not sure if I need to talk about the iBook's design, it's obviously the best looking notebook out there (besides the Powerbook).  Looks aside, the casing is extremely sturdy.  The media drive is slot loading, and the Airport Extreme network card tucks discreetly under the keyboard.  This creates a seemless look with no protruding accessories sticking out.

OSX Panther (loaded w/iLife) is a joy to work with - so much easier, more stable and more FUN than Windows.  "Entuative"' is the word I've often heard about Apple products, and there's a reason why.

I can't claim that I run my computer as hardcore as others, but I do load up and run Photoshop, Illustrator, GoLive and Reason regularly without a hitch.  I've had very minimal, if any, problems with programs freezing or kicking me out.  In fact, I've only had to call Apple's Support once so far (knock on wood), and that was to replace a rubber foot.

Alright, I could go on forever about my iBook.  The point is, it just works and I'm now a diehard Mac convert because of it (recently added iPod as well).  To me, the PC world now just seems unstable, stagnant, and bloated out.  Maybe you can save a few bucks with a PC by constantly reading computer magazines and updating anti-virus programs, but I'd rather spend my time being productive and enjoying my iBook!
I ordered iBook G4 1.2GHz from Amazon. Operating system couldn't regognize DSL connection. I called apple computers, they told me to earase and upload os x stystem, which I did. Even after that it couldn't connect to DSL, but worse it wiped out AppleWorks and many other software products.

I want to replace my computer. And it's hard to replace computer through Amazon. It will take me about 10-15 more days to do so. It's very inconvinient.
I have had this notebook since November of 2004, right out of the box anyone switching from a P.C. desktop or notebook, will notice the trackpad is sluggish and not very accurate. I called apple and went to the apple stores, everyone told me this is how the trackpads work for apple machines, even the desktops with mouses are like this( I thought my trackpad was broken ) They don't use the current mouse or redwood software, you have to find a free shareware named sidetrack, this will allow you to calibrate the tracpad to your liking and enable the side and vertical scrolling. (this is for those individuals who thought they couldn't get that option with apple notebooks) and you should upgrade the memory from 256 to 512 at least. (...)

The notebook itself is very nice, heavy compared to P.C. notebooks with the same size, but the material is much better and more sturdy with the ibook. Fast procesor, nice bright backlid screen and terrific battery life, I get an average of 4.5 hours or normal real time use (unlike P.C. notebooks that advertise 3 hours, but in real time use, surfing the web, typing, they end up low on power in 1 and 40 minutes) I mean why advertise you get 3 hours but only if you leave it on and don't do anything with it. I guess that is where apple came up with their 6 hours for the ibook on their website. Get this notebook if you travel and need word documents, spread sheets and internet. Do not get it for games (since Macs don't get any and if they do, they are buggy) This is a very nice notebook, great for students. Hope this review was helpful
I  just got my iBook less than a week ago, and let me tell you, I wonder how I did without it! It is one great notebook. I'm a recent convert from P.C. to Mac and I'm still learning this operating system. I ordered my book from the Apple Store with 768MB RAM and 80 GB on the hard drive. I've paired it with the airport extreme base and the wireless mouse. What a cool feeling to be able to surf the net from the comfort of my bed and anywhere in my home! The display on this baby is gorgeous, and watching DVDs is a blast...I originally wanted to get the 14" because I was used to that size screen, then thought it might be a drag to carry around, but now I do not regret my decision to get the 12", because it works very well for my purposes. At under 5lbs (4.9 to be exact) it is very easy to handle on the go and it takes up considerably less space than the 14". I really enjoy being able to access the net from my favorite cafe and when I'm in school. The OS is very nice and it's a relief to be free of pop-up ads and the blue screen of death. Apple provides great customer service too. Since I'm still learning a lot from this new animal, there's not much more to say now. Finally, this is one gorgeous little machine! I'm extremely pleased with it and I can't imagine anyone having regrets who buys this book. Now, if only I can get my hubby away from it...
Ok so I am not accustomed to the MAC world but I was so sick of Microsoft Windows.  I work with them at work and had a laptop at home with Windows.  This laptop kept crashing and I kept losing valuable work.  I decided to buy a new laptop.  What to buy?  I talked to my brother who told me that if I wanted my money's worth, I should purchase the Apple laptop.  One of the best advice I have gotten so far.

First, Amazon delivered the laptop quickly and at a reasonable price.  Since it was my first time ever viewing a MAC computer, was I impressed with the graphics and cool sleek design of my laptop.  It was easy to install but then I got stuck.  Having been a Microsoft user all my life, going to MAC is like an outer body experience (well, not really).  I decided the only way to learn the MAC was to buy a manual so again I went to Amazon and purchased the Missing Manual for MAC OSx ver. 10.3 Panther.  Once I get through my manual, it is just a matter of time before I learn the ins and outs of MAC.

For a beginner, I can say this, the graphics are cool, the MAC/Apple runs faster than your average laptop, the Safari (a tool for Internet) is an awesome tool and surfing through the web is much smoother and you don't have to worry about viruses (yuck) and lastly, I love the sleep mode on my Apple.  At the end of a long day with my beloved iBook, I just want to close my computer and go to sleep and that is exactly what I do.  If you ever have to run out the door, all you do is close the lid and go, no more Start, Shutdown and then the long silence that ensues while you wait for Windows to close all your programs.  Now if that isn't cool, I don't know what is.  The only problem that I am having with the iBook is learning to adjust without the backspace key, but I'll live.

I could go on but I think I have covered everything.
I will keep my trusty athlon xp because everyone knows the best games are on PC

But my apple Ibook is a great little machine. For the same price, a comparable Windows Laptop has a much worse battery life, and all the security holes to go with it. I enjoy the built in air port extreme.

With that said, I believe this is the best laptop of it's class.
What a great product. I have had this notebook for over a week and will never buy anything but a Mac from now on. Great graphics, speed and a great platform!

What was I thinking when I purchased my pc's?

The only con I can come up with is the small keyboard and compact keys can be diificult to type on but I guess most laptops are the same.

I used my Amazon charge and got $30 bucks off and also a $100 rebate! so it was a no brainer!

Bottom line, buy this laptop!
I got my iBook about a month ago and I love it.  I'd previously had a Mac in college and had been using a PC because of work for the past seven years and I'm no beginner user - fluent in just about every type of software out there from Office applications to video/audio programs.  After years of blue screens, 2 hour calls to Microsoft support, and unexplained program crashes/freezes, I am SO glad I went back to Apple.  The iBook has been an outstanding reintroduction.

For those of you worried about going back, I've found no problems with compatibility in transferring documents back and forth, the OS environment is very intuitive and takes little extra effort if you are familiar with Windows.

The iBook itself is a great value.  The 1.2 Ghz processor sounds small to Windows users, but it buries my old 2.0 Ghz Pentium3 that had 3 times the RAM of my little iBook.  The screen is sharp and impressive, the battery life is good (not quite the 6 hours advertised, but a solid 4-4.5 hours), its incredibly portable, the full-size keyboard is easy to use, and I've easily integrated the iBook at home for the full desktop experience with a regular monitor, wireless mouse, and external drive (to make up for the small hard drive).

Having to buy Microsoft Office was definitely a negative of the iBook, but it was definitely worth the extra cost.  And the iLife, iTunes, Quicken, and basic software included with the iBook is all really great.  Best of all - it never crashes!!!

I've gone back to Apple, and I'm never going to stray again.  I only wish I'd gone back sooner.  Get an iBook.  You'll love it.  Its like getting your first computer all over again.
I received this laptop for Christmas.  Once I saw the packaging of the box I thought ooo Apple.  Once I turned this laptop on it was obiously built for regular people.  This laptop was a snap to setup.  It took me about fifteen minutes total.  I recalibrated the laptop then it was ready to go.  I strongly recoend this computer.  It has many high qualities such as size, screen, airport extreme built-in, and the applications.  I hope if you get this laptop you will be as impressed as me.
First lets start by saying that I am a very conscientious consumer. I research stuff over and over before I consider buying something. I like to know that I am getting a good value for my money. I use Amazon and epinions to help reaffirm some of the decisions I've reached, and usually the other consumers on there reach the same conclusion I have. I can honestly say I spent many a night on Amazon reading other customer reviews.

  Initially I was interested in getting a notebook, not necessarily an Apple. I started doing my research, and started to realize that many of the options that I wanted, and that most consumers would want, are available on the ibook, and for much less than the competition. Everything about the ibook is very practical, and I'm a practical person. I will break this review down into some key segments.

  User interface and comfort: The apple ibook is very comfortable to use, the keys feel great, and the system weighs in at less than 5 lbs. It easily fits into my backpack, and the way the machine is constructed, I don't have to worry all day about the ibook getting damaged. The speakers aren't very loud, but in a quiet setting they are sufficient. Bass is pretty much non-existent, so if you are planning on listening to music, get some headphones. The ibook also has no protruding parts, making the machine look very sleek, as well as non-abrasive to clothing or anything else a sharp corner could snag on. The slot loading drive also makes way more sense on a notebook. Another feature I really enjoy is the ibooks' battery life, which clocks in at about 5 hours, almost double what competing Windows based notebooks have to offer.

  Technical specs: This could easily become a recap of what Apple's, Amazon's and every other site has, just technical specs. I will try and break it down for everyday use. The ibook comes standard with a 30gig HD, however I will, as others have, recommend ordering a 60gig model from Apple themselves. It costs an extra $60 and is definitely worth it. Thirty gigs of HD is not enough for most consumers, as you could fill it up very quickly. Its nice to have the 60gig to be prepared for whatever applications you may encounter in the future. The ibook comes with 256mb of DDR ram standard. Now on a Windows XP machine, 256mb would be a joke, but on the OSX operating system, it is definitely enough to get buy. I am planning on upgrading the ram, but it's not something I need to go out and do right away. The CDRW/DVD drive works flawlessly, and the Airport Extreme for wireless Internet, that comes standard with the machine, works effortlessly. A Raedon 9200 video card comes standard, with 32mb of ram, not enough to run the latest games, but sufficient to run a decent amount, and more than enough for everyday applications. Last but not least, the 12.1" screen looks very good in all sorts of lighting, although best in lower key lighting.

  The Mac OSX Operating System: If you are new to Apple computers, one thing that might make you hesitant to switch, is learning a new interface. I can attest that I was nervous before purchasing my ibook, while purchasing my ibook, while it was shipping, and up until I opened the package. Every fear or hesitation I had about the OS was immediately put to rest after about 2 minutes of use. I have never really used a Mac, not since the mid 90's, and then it was only for a few hours at school. The Mac OSX is way more intuitive and easy to use, not too mention more stable, than Windows XP could ever dream of being. Windows XP is a decent OS no doubt, but the OSX easily trumps it. Imagine a world without pop-ups, spy ware, viruses, and other annoying things associated with Windows. None of those problems exist when using a Mac. I have pretty much everything figured out after only 2 days of use. The most impressive thing however, is the OSX' ability to multi task, I can easily have 6 or 7 programs running smoothly and flawlessly. I can also switch between them with ease, no locking up, no delay, try that on XP with 256mb of ram. It really is hard to explain how great the OSX is, but have no fear in switching, for you will easily pick up on it.

  Odds and Ends: Gaming is very possible on the ibook, but you won't be able to run games at full specs. I am sure once I add more ram I will notice better performance, as Apples are known to utilize ram very well. I will be honest though, if playing the latest games on the go is what you are looking for, the ibook is not for you. There are so many software programs that come free on the ibook; it has already become a part of my everyday routine. The Internet is the same, but you don't use Internet Explorer, you use Apples own Safari program, which I find superior, and you can also download Mozilla's or Window's browsers for the ibook as well. So in my daily routine I can do everything you could want to do on the internet, as well as manage my finances with Quicken 2005, research stuff for school with World book 2004, listen to music with itunes, watch a DVD, add contacts with the address book, plan events with the calendar, and use ichat (its IMing but with more features). With all these different applications included with the ibook, its easy to see how this "ibook" can become an integral part of your everyday life. Remember that I've accomplished and learned all of this in just 3 days of use.

  So in Conclusion: I honestly could sit here and ramble on about the ibook for hours and not get bored, it really is that great of a machine. I find myself writing this not getting the least bit bored; I look forward to learning more and more about my new Apple. I don't make the best money, and spending a $1000 dollars on something I had never really had much exposure too was definitely a leap of faith, but now that my ibook is here I cant believe I used to live without it. Honestly, do yourself a favor, get to a CompUSA or an Apple store, and just sit down and play with a demo, you'll see what makes the world of Apple so appealing. I am now convinced that I need to try and switch as many people as possible over to Mac, for it truly is that much be  tter.
Having last owned a Mac about 10 years ago (Mac Classic in college), I've been eagerly looking at the platform since the release of OS X. I've recently switched both my home (eMac) and mobile computers (iBook) to Mac, and don't intend on ever going back.

The iBook is a great value (especially if you are able to get the Amazon rebate), and is a very complete package. In has pretty current hardware (1.2 Ghz G4 works great for most all current apps, but upgrade the RAM!), great functionality (small and compact with no edges to snag your clothing or your backpack, 6 hour battery life, built-in 802.11g wireless networking, great included iLife apps), great Apple industrial design, and a great operating system in OS X Panther.

Another truly great feature of the Mac notebooks is its sleep mode. Close the lid and the computer goes into power-saving sleep mode, where will happily sleep for days and days without using up the battery (I don't remember when I last reboot or shut off my iBook.) Open the lid, and it is awake and ready to go in a second or 2. Windows notebooks have this feature too, but my last couple of notebooks always end up crashing or locking up (1 was Windows 2000, the other was Win XP Professional), preventing me from using this feature. My understanding is that they take up more juice in their sleep mode as well, so they can't be used like the iBook- I feel completely comfortable putting my computer to sleep for the night without the power adapter.

Finally a comment about the Mac platform. Switching to a Mac is not as 'traumatic' an experience as is made out to be. Web, email, photos, music- all these applications are cross-platform and interchangeable between Windows and Mac users. Microsoft Office is almost completely cross-platform compatible as well. I also had a pleasant surprise the other day when I logged onto my Windows network at work with my iBook, with NO CONFIGURATION necessary! (when they set up the new network, an admin had to spend about half an hour on each Windows PC to make different necessary changes!) I don't know how that is, but within 5 minutes I was copying files from the network servers and printing to a network printer.
I have used Macs since 1990 (Classic, LC, original iMac, cube, Powerbook 140). This model replaces a G3 Pismo (400mhz) Powerbook that I bought when the 1st Titanium Powerbooks were announced. The Pismo was getting a bit too slow for my needs (especially ripping CD's & multitasking). Computers are always being upgraded & become obsolete very soon & I try to hold out as long as possible before upgrading & usually buy the most recent previous model when a new model is released (because of the price reduction).  This time, I decided to "take a step down" (from a Powerbook to an ibook w/ smaller screen) but buy the newest version of a model that's been on the market (I like to avoid buying the first iteration of a brand new model). My decision was based on the fact that I often thought about dragging around my laptop with me (I like to bike instead of driving), however the thought of lugging it around (because of its weight & size) usually ended up making me leave it at home. So when this model was upgraded to 1.2 GhZ (& wireless built in) and [..] offered a $150 rebate, I jumped.

My initial observations after having it a week?  It seems to me like this was my smartest computer purchase to date & I think it's probably the best computer value for the money of any type (PC/Mac, laptop/desktop) ever offered to date. I paid over $3000 for the Powerbook 145 in the early 90s, over $2000 for the Pismo in 2000 & now $850 for this laptop which is lighter & has many more features & better software than those previous models.

 I really do like the more compact size of the 12" model than my 15" PB. Portability/Lightness & longer battery run time are more important to me than watching DVD's or editing documents side-by-side (that's why I have my 23" cinema display at home) and I don't need to use Final Cut Pro.  When I take a laptop with me, it's usually for basic Word documents, email, internet surfing, ripping CDs & downloading pictures from a digital camera. The improvements in processor & bus speed in this model over my Pismo are very noticeable. While there is less screen real estate, new features in OS X make this less of a problem (Expose & the ability to instantly hide & switch between desktop applications).

This laptop does feel pretty durable & looks great out of the box, though I can see the white surface getting scratched/marked pretty easily, particularly if you use it a lot.  It also attracts a lot of dust & dirt (static cling). I had initially stayed away because of reports of latch problems, but it looks like this version has fixed that. The screen sort of hovers slightly over the keyboard when latched (& 2 small rubber feet keep it from touching) & it opens up to fall behind the main section (so that it doesn't catch. Getting all the features into such a compact form, though, does have a price. I noticed that the airport signal sometimes drops from 4 bars to 3, despite the fact that I haven't moved my computer (my Pismo always maintained full strength with the slower wireless card).

While the computer is great, it isn't perfect. Some differences (in using cheaper parts) are noticeable from my Pismo. I installed a 512 MB RAM stick, (which wasn't too difficult) & noticed that the ibook's keyboard is cheaper/flimsier than my Pismo. Trying to remove it was a bit difficult (only because it feels like it could break more easily & the space in which it fits is much tighter). Also, the speakers are much cheaper & sound like it. The hard drive is only 4200 RPM & I was planning on replacing it with a 60 GB/7200 RPM model, however looking at what this entails (taking the entire laptop apart), I'm contemplating taking it in to have it done (I've done all my upgrades myself to date). The touch pad also seems a bit more sensitive (my mouse will often pop around on the screen when another finger might accidentally touch it while scrolling).

The only other downsides so far? Only one Firewire port (400). This makes it difficult if you want to use an iSight camera or an ipod or an external firewire drive. You'll have to plug & unplug devices & can't keep 2 connected unless you get a hub (which you'll have to carry around). The Pismo had 2 & because of it, I gravitated towards Firewire devices (over USB). While Apple did upgrade the USB ports (2) to USB 2.0, the only Firewire port is at the slower speed. Apple seems to be dropping the ball on Firewire for some reason...maybe they're no longer going to support it? Initially it was a better choice over USB (faster & the ability to power external devices), so it's too bad.

Also, Apple has changed the installation disks that come with computers. This model comes with 10.3.5 (no more classic/OS 9) and the disks will only work for this model (previously you could upgrade all your computers to the newest OS with a new computer's installation disks). But OS X has been around for a while now & has improved quite nicely since its infancy. The entire "i" suite (iTunes, iPhoto, iDVD, Garage Band, iCal), a basic Text editing program & Appleworks (which really has been neglected for a while now) & Quicken 2005, along with games & Utilities come bundled with the OS...and the manual? Get online & access Apple's support site or other Mac sites for help, they're far more informative than the booklet or the OS's Help system.
Here are the reasons to buy this laptop:
1. It's gorgeous!  - Best looking laptop I've ever seen.
2. Price - Amazon's price (...)is the best price you'll find on any brand of laptop with this quality build in a thin/light laptop.
3. Solid - very solid construction. No creaks or rattles. Very well made.
4. Worry free - no viruses, no spyware, no freezes.
5. Easy - very intuitive and simple but powerful to use.
I LOVE IT!!!
you need to try this computer, it's great ... this is my 2nd apple, and I am very satisfied... I had a 15 inch apple, but bought this one, because it's size is more ideal for traveling.. I'm glad I  bought it at amazon, for their FAST free shipping, and with the rebate, this is the place to buy the 12 inch Apple Ibook...
This little computer is so nice! OK, I did ugrade the memory, it was cheap, and worth it, since I use some pretty large spreadsheet in my work.
Why is this computer so nice? Well, it is quite cheap, it is lightweight, it is attractive, and it does all I want it to do! I think I was one of the first to buy one at my university, University of Alaska Fairbanks, but now they are everywhere! I think it is the most popular model on campus. Let's face it: we can all dream about a 16"Powerbook, but we don't need it! This one is perfectly capable of handing most applications we are likely to encounter. It is easier to carry around also - fits in a backpack.
I'm a graduate student, and use some memeory-eating applications, but I have no problems running them on this gem. With the extra memory it is pretty fast  also.
So, I can carry all my work with me. It has reasonable sound quality if you play from iTunes. So far, the only drawback is that the cd-drive is quite loud, so you are better off downloading your music and listen from iTunes.
This is not built to the same standards as the older Toshibas that we have floating around the office. The Trubrite screen was beautiful, but you could see where corners were cut on the rest of the machine to hit the price point. The whole unit was somewhat flimsy. Most of the case is a kind of cheap looking silver plastic. The keyboard flexed with normal typing key pressure.

The machine I received ran so hot that the fan never stopped -- my wrists were sweaty from resting on the notebook after typing just a couple of email messages. I was running the notebook on a desk, so blocked ventillation ports were not the issue. (The warning sticker on the case saying that prolonged conact with bare skin may cause burns should have been a clue.) I had heard that this model ran hot, but there has got to be a design problem. This was unprecedented.

To add insult to injury, my particular computer arrived with little red lint specks in front of the LCD but behind the glossy outer screen surface. If you are considering buying this machine, take a long hard look at it in person and don't be memerized by the screen. If you do buy it, get it from Amazon and be sure to look into the Toshiba extended warranties that are available.
After laoding XP Pro this laptop has a lot of functionality in a light machine with a manageable footprint.  When travelling the 15.4 inch screen is as large as you want to go for a tray table on a plane.  At 6lbs this is 1/3 less heavy than my Dell inspiron 4000.  The four USB ports and built in WiFi allow me to do a wide variety of tasks.  The screen is great - Its brighter, and it allows me to enlarge fonts without losing information and look at large spreadsheets.  My only con point is that the keyboard has a lighter feel than my Dell that I am slowly getting used to. Otherwise a well conceived and executed laptop.  So far, so good ...
I truly love this machine.  It's powerful, light; the screen is amazing and the battery life, even with the Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMH) battery lasts up to four hours!  I dropped in a clean version of XP Pro, an additional 512Megs of RAM and she's a beast.  The only problem I had with it was that it came with XP home.  I feel most home users aren't going to blow 2K on a laptop to use for email and browsing the internet.  The other drawback was that even in XP home Toshiba had installed a bunch of their additional "user-friendly" software which ran all the time and quickly became a headache.  Moreover Toshiba also installed a hot "buy Toshiba direct" button in XP home where the search tab is under the start menu and if accidentally clicked it would take you to the Toshiba web site.

In summary, I strongly recommend this machine, but install a clean version of XP Pro; all necessary drivers are supplied on a restore CD provided by Toshiba and on their web site - very easy to install.  Any laptop you purchase will usually have that "user-friendly" software whether you like it or not.

Across the line, Sony had redesigned or refreshed most of their laptop product line, and the online photos do not do them justice at all.  I had to see this one in person before we could pull the trigger - and seeing it - it's a beautiful machine.

Searching for a replacement for my wife's Sony SRX-77 laptop (the Sony TR series computers seem to be the direct replacement model for that one) we found few laptops that met the requirement of low weight without breaking the bank.  We came across the S Series.  We thought we were getting a pretty basic laptop, but when we started using this, I now want to steal it from her - it's got great power, a beautiful screen, integrated wireless-g which is a big step up. . . this whole package is awesome.  Haven't hit any major flaws yet.  I personally don't like the mouse buttons, but that's really about it - we are very happy with this purchase.
The new xbrite screen is much more impressive than I imagined.  It is extremely bright and sharp, making pictures and video seem much more vivid than on other screens...while also allowing text to be more readable at higher resolutions.

My only complaint are the covered usb and networking ports.  Although it is nice that dust and other crud won't get lodged into them when packing it around, it makes it difficult to connect larger usb devices like keychain storage or a wireless mouse.

Overall, it is hard to beat for style and functionality.
Sony VAIO VGN-S150 Notebook Review

The pictures of the VAIO VGN-S150 on this page don't do it justice - this laptop is very small and stylish, and definitely has a cutting-edge, highly designed look.  It's certainly as physically pretty as anything that Apple has to offer, and as far as I can tell, Sony designed this notebook to attract Apple customers (it's certainly a big style improvement over clunky Dell and IBM computers).  The VGN-S150 is very small and light, but it has a wide screen format.  This keeps the system very portable, but gives you critical extra screen space so the display doesn't feel cramped or undersized.  The display is probably the high point of this system - it's fantastically bright and sharp looking.  It uses Sony's XBRITE technology - I initially thought this was an expensive gimmick, but it really does look MUCH better than equivalent laptop LCD screens.  It has all the depth and color richness of a regular monitor.  The color black especially is much richer and darker than I've seen on other laptops, which is very important if you want to watch DVDs.

All in all, the system seems very well-designed: the ports all seem to be in logical places (there are none on the back, which makes sense), and the keyboard, though small, doesn't feel jammed together (if you have gigantic hands, it will make you miserable - it's not THAT spacious).  Unfortunately, the keys feel a little bouncy, but I got used to it after just a little while of typing, and it didn't really slow me down.

 On a more technical note, this is a pretty fast system, using Intel's relatively new Centrino processor, which seems to deliver on performance and battery life.  The built-in wireless G is great - it's plenty fast, of course, and the switch is built right on to the front of the system (not hidden away underneath like something shameful).  It worked perfectly right out of the box.  The system also has a 32MB video card, something a little unusual in such a small laptop.  The dedicated video can easily handle day to day tasks (of course), and is beefy enough to tackle most games on the market now (July 2004).  I imagine that it will not cut the mustard with 3D games for very long (32MB is certainly on the low end of video ram), but I shouldn't think that many people will buy this computer to play games.

 All in all, this is a great choice for students or executives who want a stylish, powerful computer to take with them on the road (In fact, it has some sort of proprietary monitor-switching technology for presentations, but I haven't tried it out yet).  It's very versatile for a superportable computer, so DVDs and gaming are certainly not out of the question.

PROS

- Very stylish and sleek looking

- Superb display

- Tiny

- Has dedicated video RAM

- Intelligently laid out (this is a huge point with me - all the ports are in useful places)

- AC adapter is small and has a cool glowing light which will impress the kind of people who like glowing lights

- Has a mute button (the speakers are OK, about what you'd expect from a laptop)

- Flawless wireless G integration

- Battery life seems pretty good

CONS

- Keyboard is bouncy and not too big (and requires Function keys for end, page down etc)

- Included software is pretty much useless (but about standard for PC laptops), and comes with various advertisements (Actually, there are a few amusing programs for digital photography and media sharing among many VAIOs, but these are not exactly a hot selling point)

- Some ports covered with plastic lids - this actually makes the system look very sleek when they're closed, but I'm afraid that they might break off at some point, and they're kind of in the way when you're hooking things up (this could be either pro or con, really).

- According to The Internet, Sony's customer service is not great, but I haven't had any problems yet and thus haven't had to contact them.
I just thought I'd add a few additions/corrections to Czarina's review, to help fence-sitters decide.

1.  The video chipset is actually pretty good compared to what some (though not all) value laptops on the Windows side have.  Having a Windows laptop doesn't mean much if you're using "Intel Extreme Graphics" (which pretty much rules out any 3D gaming).

2.  To solve the USB printer situation, you can always get an Airport Express or Airport Extreme base station.  Both have a USB port on them to let you free up a USB port on the Mac itself.

3.  There are P2P programs for the Mac, including ones that connect to the Kazaa network.  Acquisition is a notable example.  Keep in mind, of course, that grabbing copyrighted stuff from P2P isn't nice!  It's faster and easier to buy through iTunes, anyways.
(Last edit: 5/9/05)

This is my very first Mac.  I got tired of PCs when my 1-year-old Vaio notebook kept overheating and shutting down on me, so I researched on notebooks known for quality rather than quantity of memory, speed, etc.  When I bought this iBook, I upgraded the RAM to 512MB because all the reviews for the last iBook G4 recommended it.  I also opted for the 80GB hard drive, leaving me about 68GB of free space before installing other programs myself.  Overall, I'm pretty satisfied.

What's GOOD:
- The speed of this notebook surprised me.  PC users, don't let the 1.33GHz fool you.  Compared to my 2.4GHz, 512MB Vaio, this iBook's performance is the same, if not better.  It runs very quietly as well.
- The battery life is quite impressive (my average = 6 hours).  This laptop actually pinned down the most essential requirement of a portable device.
- The software bundle is awesome.  iLife '04 is very user-friendly, so you won't need to touch an instruction manual to get the hang of things.  Lately, I've been addicted with GarageBand--creating hip-hop beats have never been so easy.
- I thought the 1-button mouse thing was gonna be annoying, but after I plugged in my USB, 2-button mouse to the iBook, the right-click button actually worked!  The little scroll wheel on the mouse works, too.  The little menu that pops up have less options than Windows, but I think it's a decent enough transition for a former PC user like me.
- iTunes is the most convenient music store I've ever encountered.  I'm tired of Kazaa bombarding my computer with spam and damaged songs, so I thought buying music legally was worth a try.  If you want to stick with free, p2p file sharing, then at least you'll enjoy iTunes as a great media player.  Wait till you see its visualizer...
- This iBook came with a built-in Airport Extreme.  It's WiFi certified 802.11g, so it should work with any standard wireless router.  I connected seamlessly with my Netgear wireless router and a friend's Linksys one.
- Running large programs like GarageBand and Adobe Photoshop CS showed no glitches whatsoever.  Also, I often have Dreamweaver, Flash, Photoshop and Illustrator running simultaneously, and I never experience any technical problems.
- This thing fits perfectly in my backpack, and it has a light, yet very solid feel to it.  Nothing rattles, sticks out or snaps off, making it very convenient as a portable device.
- Last and most important of all, this notebook has NOT slowed down, crashed, overheated, or blown up on me.

What's NOT SO GOOD:
- Choices on Mac games are very, VERY limited.  I bought this iBook realizing that I can't install any of my current PC games in it (only Warcraft III was compatible).  The video card is pretty low, too, especially for the latest games (Radeon 9200, 32MB).  I really wish I didn't have to sacrifice games for this Mac.
- The iBook does get warm whenever I'm installing a program or running large programs simultaneously.  Fortunately, it's not nearly as hot as my crappy Vaio.
- There are only 2 USB ports, so I have to do some plugging/unplugging between my printer, scanner, and mouse.  This may be a bother to some people.
- The built-in speakers are somewhat lacking, which is a common issue with laptops.  If you're heavy into music like me, getting some decent speakers with a subwoofer is a must.  I use the old ones I bought for my Vaio.
- Everything on the screen is anti-aliased, which means the edges of fonts and sharp images are blurred so their pixels won't look so prominent.  This attempt on improving monitor resolution seems to be a standard on all Macs.  You'll either love it, get used to it (like I did), or detest it like many former PC users do.
- Again, more conflicts with PC software.  Having a Mac is the reason why I have to buy Adobe software (personally, I needed to upgrade my version anyway).  This means that if you're a recent Mac convert like me, you may have to spend some extra cash on new software, i.e. Microsoft Office, etc. (unless you use Kazaa again, of course... heh, good luck on finding Mac programs on that).

Despite a few compromises, I'm really glad with my purchase.  Macs really shine when it comes to quality--once you see this notebook's overall design, you'll realize that the people from Apple really think of everything.  Even the AC adaptor's folding prongs, cord hooks and light indicator made it 10 times more convenient than a plain one.  With its imperfections, the iBook still clearly deserves 5 stars.
I just got my first Apple computer, this iBook, and I have to say, I've been converted. Not only is this computer fast, fun, and beautiful to look at, its so sleek yet powerful. I highly recommend it! I don't think I've ever had a computer I love this much. Haven't had any problems at all! The switch from Windows to Apple was not as big a change as I thought it would be. And it helps that Apples just look so good! I am very very happy!
I bought my iBook from Amazon.com through a referer website. Macintouch.com listed the price significantly lower than I could find anywhere else. The price difference turned out to be a rebate but that is fine for me. The rebate document was available through the rebate link off the product page and all the information required was here when my iBook arrived. I bought the two day shipping and was disappointed when, at the end of my transaction, the estimated date for shipping was seven days after my purchase then another two for the shipping. I was especially disappointed since the product page claimed the product would ship in one to two days. Fortunately the iBook shipped early-- two days later. It was packaged very safely and worked right out of the box.

People have told me that buying the 14.1 inch iBook was a waste since
If you're a hard-core Windows user, PLEASE STEP AWAY FROM THE REVIEW!

Now that they're gone, let's talk about the iBook. It isn't the most powerful computer in Apple's line-up, but it's their least expensive portable. Look at what you get though.

CD/DVD burner...built-in

Wireless connectivity...built-in

Productivity software...built-in

USB 2 and FireWire...built-in

AV out port...built-in

Industry leading support after the sale...included

Movie creation software...included

DVD creation software...included

Music management...included

Music creation...included

Photo archiving and manipulation software...included

Protection from viri and trojan horses...included

Actually the last is a bit of a tease. No known viruses or trojan horses can get past OS/X. The only vunerability is if you type in your admin password and physically install an exploit. MS Windows should be so protected out the box.

Where it's lacking

Only 256 m of memory...Memory is relatively cheap. Apple should have put in at least 512 m.

60 gig hard drive only runs at 4200 RPM. This is slow. Apple should use faster (5400 or better) drives. Especially if you plan on using this as a multi-media editor for music or movies. While you can put in a faster drive (Not easily though. The iBook is a tough nut to crack), you'll void your warrenty doing so unless it's done through an Apple certified service center. Fortunately, there are several manufacterer's of USB 2 and FireWire based external drives ranging from 20 gigs to 250 gigs and up. If portability is an issue, make sure the drive can be buss-powered. The iBook can supply power for such drives through its USB 2 and FireWire ports.

No FireWire 800 ports. While this irks me, it really isn't that big an issue. There are few (so far) devices that use FW 800.

Only a 32 meg video card. If all you want to do is play games, you'll most likely be disappointed by the iBook's graphics card. If this is an issue, spend a little more and get a PowerBook which has a 64 meg card.

No backlighting options for the keyboard or screen. The PBs have this (15 and 17 inch), but it is not an option on the iBook. Not that big a deal unless you  are a mole living in total darkness most of the time. The light off the LCD provided me with enough light (Barely) to see the keyboard in low-light conditions.

While it may seem like I have a lot of complaints about this computer, I actually prefer it in many ways over its much more expensive sibling, the PowerBooks. When the time came for a new portable to replace my G3 based Pismo (Apple fans know what this is), I chose the iBook instead of the PB. With my cost savings, I bought more memory and an external USB 2 80 gig Hard drive.

Last thing and then I'll shut up. I recommend the excellent AppleCare 3 year protection plan. Remember that it is a laptop and like any other small electronic device, can be damaged more easily than its tower cousins.
Nights after nights for the researches, I finally decided to go with Sony... The first thing that really attracts me was the xbrite screen, SO bright and very natural. It is true that there is no anti-reflective coating on the screen but as far as I have used it, I have no problem. I think problem will be when you use it with very bright light on your back (like sun light) or when you watch movie or play game with dark color tone shows on screen, that the reflection shows up strongly. Otherwise, for normal Windows users like me, it is hard to say reflection is a problem.

It is lighter and thinner than all the laptops I have ever used. I hardly notice heat after hours of usage. Battery life last for about 4 hours (without using CD) - I tried to set the power management but still can't reach 5 hours as spec.

But one thing that bothers me is a plastic cover on the ports. There is a little lock on two sides of each piece of plastic. I feel like this lock will crack sooner or later if you use USB port all the time (well, you can't avoid this if you use mouse). If it really cracks, the cover plastic won't fit in its lock anymore and it will just keep falling off...
Have had this laptop for just a week, and the machine is more than I could have hoped for.  It is light, bright and clean!  At just over 4 lbs its light, and 1 lb of that is the battery.

Speaking of the battery, it is a wonder.  The machine and I went on a 3 hour plane trip, and the battery lasted the entire trip with power to spare.

With the built-in WiFi, I am able to easily to connect to any, and I mean any, open connection.  With a simple slide of a switch on the front, its off.  Perfect for airplane travel.

Its a winner!
After a 2 week whirlwind trip to Europe and back I have to say that I am over-the-moon with the Sony VAIO VGN-S260.

Firstly, this is the lightest laptop I have ever owned (by far) and it has been tremendous. I trecked miles and miles with the notebook in my backpack, and really didn't notice it. It was great to give my feet a break at a coffee shop and jump online with the WiFi which is everywhere now.

Secondly, the battery life is also superb. I just have the standard battery and it lasted as long as I needed it to on the long plane trips. It easily lasts 4+ hours without even trying to conserve the battery.

Thirdly, the screen is great. I have always had bigger screens on notebooks but I feel the 13" is of such a great quality I do not mind in the slightest.

Finally, the speed is great. I am a fairly demanding computer user and have always opted for the "desktop replacement"-style notebook. Well the 1.7GHz Centrino takes care of this and this laptop is at least as fast as my previous Pentium 2.4GHz laptop. An upgrade to 1GB of RAM should make this all I ever want. For now.

Well done! A superb product. I am never going back to so-called 'desktop replacement' notebooks.

(the only negative is the Pg Up/Pg Dwn keys requiring the function key. I am sure I will learn to get over it though.)
The sony LCD screen is not under the notebook warranty.  The screen is extremely fragile.  I bought a S260 for 3 weeks and then found LCD screen had a crack.  It turned out the damage on LCD is not under warranty and I had to pay $726 to replace the screen.  When you purchase the notebook, consider to pay some extra money to buy LCD insurance might be a good idea.
Let me get this out first, this is a great laptop. Its speedy, it runs FOREVER (five hours plus measured) on the extended battery and it is comfortable to type on. Further the nominal 4.2 lbs of weight is very light considering how feature rich (built in DVD drive & 60GB hard drive) this machine can be.

Sony has been hit or miss in the laptop game recently. A spate of quality problems and spinning a generation without WiFi really cramped their style. The laptop is one of their completely revamped line. First the positives...

The 13" wide screen (WXGA resolution of 1280 x 800) is brite and readable in lots of environments. Don't sit directly in bright sun but even a small amount of cover will give good results. Further, battery life doesn't depend on the display running extremely dimly. There are a number of web sites that don't look "right" when in full screen mode, but that will change. Other things like Acrobat reader that like to put things on the side of the documents (contents, helpful links) actually look better because decent margins are maintained. Email is especially nice as folders on the left, full size email message on the right works very nicely. Its also a great "wide screen" DVD player on the airplane, although the sound system is somewhat 'tinny' (not uncommon on laptops).

The extra screen width also means that the keyboard can be more "normal" sized than your typical ultralight machine. The center of the 'a' key to the center of the "enter" double wide key is 8.75 on my full size Microsoft keyboard and 8.375 on the VAIO. I had no trouble at all touch typing on the VAIO after using my full size keyboard. The ctrl key is in the right place too, as is backspace and delete. The compromises came on the keypad keys (more on that in a minute). Arrow keys are an inverted T just below the right shift.

Battery life is great, with the regular battery getting a solid 3  - 3.5 and the extended battery getting 5.5 - 6. Using the extended battery does NOT require removing the DVD/CD-RW drive. All very good. Battery life is enhanced by using the built in on/off switch for the WiFi chip.

The software bundle is unremarkable, evaluation versions of Office and apparently a bundled version of Works. My system came with WinXP/SP2 already installed. It also comes with Norton Internet Security suite which is a pain to remove (corporate standard was Macafee). There is a memory stick slot, and the full sized RJ45 connection for wired networks. The docking station adds a parallel port. (no serial port though).

Now the things that can be improved...

First the extended battery is $299 list. That's a huge chunk of change for a battery. I look forward to the third party batteries being available here. The second was the keypad keys. Most of the "other" keypad keys (Home, End, Insert, Delete, etc) are bound as 'function' modified variations. So to press 'Home' you need to hit Fn-left arrow. Since FN is a small key between CTRL and the windows key you can easily miss it. That makes many otherwise quick moves, less quick. The worst offenders are that PgUp and PgDn are tied to Fn-up arrow, and Fn-down arrow. That makes flipping through documents single handedly while sipping coffee VERY tough. (You can still use a scroll mouse but its a pain). Personally I would have liked them to extend the keyboard south into the wrist area to accomodate that but they didn't. The external VGA (video) connector comes out of the left side (sort of like the Thinkpad X series) and that can be difficult if you're putting your mouse over there. No composite video out either so you can't use this as a DVD player in your hotel room.

Finally there is performance. The VAIO turns is a strong performance here with the 1.7G Pentium-M and 512MB of RAM. Even on batteries when the CPU has lowered its speed to conserve energy its peppy enough to watch DVDs or play games with respectable performance. This is unlike the Sharp MM20 which sacrifices speed for long battery life, or the X505 which costs two arms and two legs.

If Sony can address the keyboard issues this would be the perfect laptop for all my mobile needs.
This Notebook is exceelnt for those person that will only use it in the house or office.
The Sony PCG-K33 is a powerful laptop at a reasonable price. With its 3.06 P4 and a decent ATI graphics card, it has the punch to run many of the games out today. The built in wireless is nice for those who use this type of networking, although it took a little wrangling to get it to work with my router.

OK - you don't want to hear me ramble, you just want to know the nitty-gritty. So here it is:

Positives:

1) Speed. Although you will probably want to go up to a gig of memory to get all the speed out of this puppy.

2) Full sized keyboard - I am used to an ergo, but this isn't bad.

3) Looks - Sony has the fashion edge. The thing is sexy.

4) Monitor - X-Brite and wide screen. One word: gorgeous.

5) Built-in wireless. Very good range.

6) Video card - You can adjust the memory allocated to the card. It does a good job with games and a great job with DVDs.

Negatives:

1) Battery life - it's just stupid short.

2) Size and weight - Like I said, this is a desktop replacement. It barely qualifies as a portable. Unless you're a steroid taking baseball player, this thing gets heavy very fast.

3) Heat - I recommend a laptop cooling pad to aid in cooling the Vaio. It gets very hot.

4) Memory stick port - Come on Sony, this is a ploy to sell us another one of your products. I have nothing else that uses a memory stick. I don't ever see using this.

5) Hard drive size - For the price, it should come with at least an 80 GB drive.

Bottom line is... if you are looking for a portable look elsewhere. If you like the idea of being able to surf the web and/or play a game while watching TV or laying in bed, the PCG-K33 is worth consideration. I am happy with the purchase and can deal with the machine's quirks.
I purchased a Sony VAIO PCG-K33 after my A10 Toshiba laptop broke down in less than a year!  The Sony laptop is very powerful, I am crunching numbers while writing papers and it works very good.  However, it is a little heavy and the fan is noisy.
Last Friday I went ahead and purchased a Vaio K35 from a BestBuy. The screen is really great, and they had 24 months no interest plan to pay the $1350 after rebates. That all sounded like a good deal back then...

The Vaio K35 froze on me the first day after sending the notebook to hibernation.  Needless to say I started testing how it did with hibernation/standby.  The freeze didn't happen always, but it happened close to half the times it came from hibernation, never from standby it seems. I made sure the BIOS was not doing any power management, just Windows. Even the VAIO Power Management was disabled inside windows power management control panel. Also, I had the lattest drivers from Vaio Update. Still, it was freezing some times after hibernation.

Installed Windows XP Pro + Service Pack 2 + All the Vaio Drivers and Updates, and still the same thing. It didn't happen always, but yesterday night it froze again coming back from hibernation.  Enough for me.

This morning I took the notebook to Bestbuy in the frozen state actually, so they could see it. The technician's verdict: "There's no mechanical problem, this is Microsoft's fault, the laptop is within Sony specifications."  There was no appeal to this incompetent verdict despite my several attempts.  I've used IBM notebooks for a long time at work, with no hibernation problem.  And my brother has a Vaio S260 without that problem.

Since I didn't want the laptop, I was going to be charged the 15% restocking fee, $240, or I had to replace it with another laptop.  Chose to return it, and already sent an email to BestBuy's Customer Service directly, to fight for this unfair restocking fee applied in this case.

These Vaios have a nice screen, but basicaly that's it. Battery doesn't last too long, just one hour watching a DVD.  Fan is a bit noisy, and the laptop freezes whenever it feels like after hibernation.  Definitely not recommended.
Bought this computer at Sam's club today.  I got tired of my old Dell Inspiron 8100 (P3 1.0 ghz) crashing on me and freezing up on me.  Never heard from Averatec before but seems like a lot of people buying this brand because of excellent value.  This computer is blazingly fast and it is a great deal/price considering all the goods that came with it.  DVD burner, a decent graphics card and a P4 3.0 ghz.  Obviously, I cannot comment on how it compares to other P4 laptops.  It is more of a desktop replacement weighing in at 7.7 lbs.  The keyboard is quiet and the fan is quiet.  Will comment on durability later.

IT IS NOW 5 MONTHS LATER.  COMPUTER SHUTS DOWN BY ITSELF FREQUENTLY BECAUSE IT OVERHEATS.  I AM DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PRODUCT:  1 STAR NOW (OUT OF 5).
May be the laptop has superb features for which i have chosen it for my use. And after paying the money via western union to a newly launched seller amazon(who still uses the Email ID- sls_representant@yahoo.com)-the seller had disappeared  without delivering it. So even if you are getting some really good or cheap prices for a laptop just be sure that you will be getting that.
Buyers watch out for private sellers

There are a lot of private sellers trying to rip you off .prices look cheap when you send the money you won't get the product or your money back.

Look for the specific items that scammers try to do:

1. Look at the seller's id they look like some what irrelevant. Example (amazon_cheap)(Sony_Amazon)

2. Look at the sellers rating it says just launched because the sellers like to create many e mails as they can.

3. In the sellers comments they will say like "please contact me before buying. Otherwise I won't send you the item".

4. When you send the e mail to them they will say "we are a small company in Romania or UK or Spain trying to evolve to sell outside the country". They will say send money through western union. When I get the money you will get the notebooks with in 2 business days.

5. They will send detailed sellers address where to send the money western union (Spain). I said "I know the address in Spain can I come and pay to that address" he said "I will do only through online" this is cheater.

When you send money through western union you won't get your money back.

Escrow and Amazon secure payment are the trusted payment.

I got an e mail from a seller he said "I will get transaction only through Amazon secure payment. I thought he was good seller. Next e mail he wrote "tell me your complete address I will forward the address to Amazon" I gave him my address .

With in 1 day I got a e mail from "Amazon secure payment" from address looked like it was from Amazon, but when I clicked on reply the to address said "(something@yahoo.com) it was not a e mail from Amazon in that message it said  Amazon wants you to make payment through western union. I wrote the email to Amazon they said we will not allow any one to pay through Amazon these are fake e mails trying to rip peoples money.
This a DESKTOP REPLACEMENT, no doubt!

For the features, is NOT so heavy...with the added port replicator is a monster laptop, sound is exceptional thru the 12" speaker included in the packet.

The screen is out of the mind...extremely brilliant and nitid..even better than my office Vaio K23, its 17 inches surpasses all expectations... the bundle softwares is ok, even would be better if would bring some more burning applications

PROS: Superbrilliant screen, convenient size, 1 gb Ram and 64 mb ATI video card 9600, quick response, 100 Gb HD, not so heavy, nice port replicator, burn Double Layer DVD, wireless work extremely smooth....

CONS:  Port replicator easily detached in a non-totally horizontal surface (lap, etc), my XP crashed two times with Gigapocket appl. (for TV captures)...no big deal

After buying this machine I noticed the Toshiba 17" COSMIO with 100 GB HD, 512 RAm and the TV/Video card inside, no need of port replicator, A comparison would be interesting to find.

I wonder why the Vaio A series did not come with all in there as the GRT models did.

Anyway this in an excellent laptop for home.
Very powerful and versatile machine with immense capacity and effortless operation. It was out of the box and working witin five minutes. All Sony-installed software works fine.  You don't really need a whole gigabyte of RAM and an 80 gigabyte hard drive on a laptop-but you don't really need a Mercedes, either!

Highly recommended!
I got this notebook today and man it is LOUD! I'm talking borderline annoying. If you walk by my office it sounds like I have a floor fan running in there. That's my biggest complaint. I could hardly beleive it. I sure hope I can get used to it. If it weren't for the loudness I would have given this notebook a 4 or maybe 5. Maybe something is wrong with mine and I just don't know it.

Also the adaptor is HUGE, but I live with that.

Otherwise a decent notebook. The screen is the best part. Eye candy - very clear and crisp. I'm sure it will work out to be a good notebook for me. But SONY should throw a pair of earplugs for those who would rather not hear the whiz of the cooling fan all day.
This computer is great when it comes to raw power.  If you have going 8 downloads, 6 uploads, running Microsoft Office, a couple

number crunching programs going, and want to watch a DVD, this is really the computer for you.  The 1GB is great, multitasking no problem.  It is big by comparison with some Pentium M ultraportables for sure, but, no way can you ever get those chips to equal the power of a fast Pentium chip.  The battery, typical laptop and the P4 does eat them up, just throw an extra one in your laptop case for use later if needed and no problem.
After searching among the large amount of choices on the market, I found the Sony K37 to have right mix of performance, features, and price. I was sold on two things in this laptop First it has the best picture/screen among other brands on the shelf, and the 1 Gig of Ram. Add to that the Pentium 3.2 HT processor with 533 front side bus, large 80 Meg hard drive, very fast wireless B/G adaptor even though my router is an old Linksys 11 Meg B standard, and the dual layer 8X +/- DVD writer, the rest of the specs are large 15.4 brilliant screen, full size keyboard, 56K Modem, 1 Fire wire 1394, 3 USB 2, Ethernet adaptor, 1 A/V out, Microphone in, Audio out, and a lot of multimedia and authoring software.

Set up is a breeze, the laptop is unpacked, hooked, and run in 5 minutes, you better have things to do right away. Performance is more than adequate when I run Macromedia's Dreamweaver and Fireworks applications, Microsoft Excel, Word, few browser windows, and Outlook email at the same time.

Here are few complains; AC adaptor is bulky, tiny printed user guide with all instructions and help files online, no recovery or software disks included, but instead the recovery files is saved on a special partition on the hard drive and you need to create the recovery media yourself using the provided utility, one blank DVD and one blank CD-R, battery life under 2 hours, hard drive speed is only 4200 RPM, the 2100 DDR-Ram speed is only 266 Mhz, and finally the video memory is shared with the default being 64 Meg(user configurable to 32,64, or 128 Meg through the BOIS), but with 1 Gig of Ram, sharing won't disappoint.

A word about Hyper Threading or HT processor, while it is a promising technology for tomorrow's fast memory and HT aware software, for today's user there is a little gain. First, HT was developed with the faster Rambus memory in mind - currently at 1066 speed, but for the slower DDR-RAM system the speed-up will be modest. Second, it will be a long time before software written or rewritten to take advantage of the HT. For now, most benchmark has showed little or no improvements over the non HT processor.

That been said, in the end of the day this is a handsome, quite, and fulfilling notebook for under $1,600.
The notebook does not support Hyper Threading (as given in many sites). I checked the Intel site for this processor and found that it does (or so I thought). Just to confirm, I downloaded Intel Processor Id utility and it reported that the processor does not support HT.

  As is the case with most of the branded notebooks, the amount of tweaking that you can do on the system is highly limited. For example, you cannot even change any BIOS settings (except date time/parallel port info and set passwords). None of the advanced chipset features are available. And the BIOS is phoenix bios, which is not supported by most of the BIOS tweak tools that you can run from windows.

  The cooling fan does make a lot of noise at times, but I have come to get used to that and unfortunately, you cannot control the fan speed through the power management tool (unlike the case in some other models).

  The display is really good with high resolution. I am not into much gaming and all, so the 4X AGP does not make much difference to me.

  A couple of things Sony could have improved upon was to put a 333 MHz memory instead of a 266 MHz one and provide a more versatile card reader (the card reader slot supports only Memory Stick Media. So if you want to connect your CF or SD card, you need an external reader.

  But having said this much, I am happy with the system and it has not given me any problems so far.
I've been looking for awhile for the right notebook for me, at the right price and this was the best I could find.  I first tried building one on Dell, but it always ended up way out of my price range and didn't have nearly the capacity and ability this notebook has.  I would buy another if I needed one.
To respond to the review stating that the VAIO K35 locked up after hibernation when every it felt like it, is untrue.  I just bought my K35 and the only time it locks up is when it is running on the battery, but this only occurs when the battery is less than 10% charged.  Spoke with Sony and they stated that this was due to the VAIO not having enough power to do anything else.  When the battery is better charged or when plugged in it never locks up after hibernation.

To respond to the review about the loud fan, well the fan does produce noise, but come on it needs to cool down.  And really the sound of the fan is not that loud, I guess it would be if you were in a completely quiet room.  I have found that normally I don't even notice the fan running.

I personally like the VAIO K35 and would recommend it.  Though I wish it was lighter and thinner, but I knew these specifications before I bought it.
I bought this model from BB in mid Dec & I would recommend it to anyone replacing their desktop. I installed xp pro + sp2 full version and contrary to other reviews I have had NO problem with hibernation. It burns dvd's & cd-r's very fast & efficiently. Mine has not locked up in hibernation mode. The software package is ok, but I use my own software to create & burn dvd's. It is fast, dependable (so far) great screen size & so far the best all around laptop I have purchased. I did a lot of research on this one. For the money, you get a lot. Big HD, Dual dvd burner in dvd+r( dvd-r dvd+r in single layer) All I will do is upgrade the RAM to 1 gig. I am very happy with this laptop.  Think of it this way, my old vaio I bought 4 years ago cost $2400.00 and could not do 1/2 the stuff this one can. No burner, different screen, slower cpu, and top ram was 512. But it could play dvd's. It is still running, my son has it for his job- works great. The only maint I did was about a year ago the hd went-not Sony's fault-this happens. Replaced it & no probs. This pcg-K35 is a buy at $1399.00 with the $250.00 rebate. I highly recommend it.
Last Friday I went ahead and purchased a Vaio PCG-K35 from BestBuy.  The screen is really great, and they had 24 months no interest plan to pay the $1350 after rebates. That all sounded like a good deal back then...

The Vaio K35 froze on me the first day after sending the notebook to hibernation. Needless to say I started testing how it did with hibernation/standby. The freeze didn't happen always, but it happened close to half the times it came from hibernation, never from standby it seems. I made sure the BIOS was not doing any power management, just Windows. Even the VAIO Power Management was disabled inside windows power management control panel. Also, I had the lattest drivers from Vaio Update. Still, it was freezing some times after hibernation.

Installed Windows XP Pro + Service Pack 2 + All the Vaio Drivers and Updates, and still the same thing. It didn't happen always, but yesterday night it froze again coming back from hibernation. Enough for me.

This morning I took the notebook to Bestbuy in the frozen state actually, so they could see it. The technician's verdict: "There's no mechanical problem, this is Microsoft's fault, the laptop is within Sony specifications." There was no appeal to this incompetent verdict despite my several attempts. I've used IBM notebooks for a long time at work, with no hibernation problem. And my brother has a Vaio S260 that so far doesn't have that problem.  Microsoft had no problem with hibernation, at least not with other laptops.  *This* laptop had the problem.  In fact, later on I received an email from Sony indicating "According to the information you have provided, it appears that your Vaio will require service".  But this I got after returning it to BestBuy.  According to this "geek squad" technician, this wasn't a hardware failure.  So far I'm being charged the restocking fee, but I'm planning to litigate that through BBB (Better Business Bureau).

These Vaios have a nice screen, but basicaly that's it. Battery doesn't last too long, just one hour watching a DVD. Fan is a bit noisy, and the laptop freezes whenever it feels like after hibernation.  Definitely not recommended.
The Pentium 4 CPU requires that the fan run all the time at a very fast speed which means that it is VERY noisy. I looked at this very model in several stores and NEVER heard the fan run. I was told by Sony that the fan was not on in the store because it wss bssically being used as a "TV" not a computer. I feel that this is false advertising. I did extensive research on this unit before purchasing. Now I am facing up to a $400.00 penalty when I return this unit to have the seller take it back (if they will). This is bad business and bad retail policy on the part of Amazon. Buyer beware!
I bought this notebook a month ago. It's tiny and lightweight, which is great when traveling. When I am not traveling, which is most of the time, it's a little too small. The monitor is 12.1", but with LCD prices dropping, I guess I'll buy one soon. The keyboard is too small for comfort, but I bought the Logitech Wireless Desktop from Amazon for 29.99. The USB ports and all other ports are one the side, which is a little messier than having them all in the back. The fan was a little noisy, but I calibrated it, and now it's fine. It runs extremely well, and I guess all in all, I am very happpy with my purchase. The price is great with this much memory, HD space, and a DVD-RW. I give it 4 stars.
This is my first time to review a product! I cannot believe this product has this much high rating! Don't be deceived by the previous compliments to this product. Now I seriously regret that I spent my money on this shoddy laptop. Now I'm searching for a new laptop just one year after I bought this product. This laptop has tons of defects, but especially the AC adapter sucks! It is really hot not in a good way, the battery life is short, the speaker sound is bad, the fan is VERY noisy, and the AC adapter stopped working because it melted the plastic around the connector. If you have enough money to check whether my complains are true, buy it as you please. Otherwise, keep my warnings in mind!
After spending the first two years of law school lugging around an incredibly heavy (~8 lb.) laptop and too many ridiculously heavy case books, I started looking for a lighter alternative. I stumbled upon the Averatec and tried it because I was impressed by the specs and the price. I could buy three Averatecs for the price of one Sony Vaio.

I LOVE this computer. It is light and the perfect size to tuck into any briefcase or bag. I have gotten as much as 4 hours from a fully charged battery, and have gone two days without plugging it back in by putting it in sleep mode.

It does have some drawbacks. The speakers are pretty bad, but since I only use them to play "Sugar, Sugar" by the Archies for my daughter, I can live with them. Lectures and tutorials sound fine on them.

It also does get pretty hot, but my techno-nerd husband has instilled in me the habit of always setting my notebook on a book or wooden tray (never directly on my lap or a pillow), so the fan can work pretty efficiently. I have never burned myself on this computer.

There are a few rub marks on the inside plastic around the screen, but they are really easy to remove with a pencil eraser.

I am thrilled with my purchase and have used it every day for nearly a year. It is exactly what I wanted and cost much less than I expected. I plan to continue using it when I practice, perhaps with a universal docking station. I LOVE this computer!
For the price offered, it's hard to beat. The XP-M processor is the counterpart to the Pentium-M and saves battery power. Plus, with 802.11g and an 80GB drive, it fulfills all my needs as amedia desktop as well. Great functions for a low price. [...]

Two thumbs up for Averatec.
I purchased this notebook due to four main features:
AMD processor
Weight/size
Cost
Comes with a CD backup of Windows XP (Compaq & HP systems often don't)

I had been shopping for a notebook for some time, but to purchase one with the features I wanted ( 80G hard drive, DVD/CD burner, wireless card, 512MB RAM) the cost was going to be double this price.  At first I thought the 12" screen would be too small, but it is fine.  I now prefer it to the 15.4" lcds.
Yes, the system runs a bit hot, but that is an inherent trait of AMD processors.  It also is very fast... just a side effect of the warmth...
The best part is that the hard drive is not loaded to bloating with useless software.  This system basically comes with Windows XP SP2, MS Works, Norton Antivirus (which I removed for Panda AV)
and Power DVD.  I had at first considered removing Power DVD and adding Nero but Power DVD is very easy to use and basic.
I'm glad I purchased this system.
UPDATE:  I somehow managed to lose one of the little rubber feet on the bottom in my lightweight portable travels.  One quick call to Averatec and an explanation, and a new set was mailed out promptly to my home!  I'm still extremely glad I purchased this laptop.  As with **any** computer, it takes the knowledge to d'load drivers, tweak the bios, and maintenance one to keep it running properly!
Alright, so its a great laptop. Its cheap, its got everything a reasonable person could want from a laptop. And it's pretty. For a little while.

I tend to lay my wrists down when i'm typing. In this case, they go on the laptop in front of the keyboard. In a matter of weeks, palmprint-shaped blemishes showed up on the once immaculate silver finish. Those wrists of mine wore through the finish, down to the plastic, in a hurry.

The silver finish on this thing is a joke, it scratches off if you raise your voice at it. There are two big scratches that are on either side of the monitor, which comes from the part of the laptop it meets when its closed.

Even better, i once apparently picked up the laptop the wrong way and it nearly cracked in half. The thing is built that if you pick it up while holding the front, the inertia of the laptop could quite possibly break it in two.

Whats more, 3 of the 5 rubber feet came off of it in the first few weeks, as well.

Now, i'll admit i'm not as gentle as i could be to this. I didn't buy this thing to lower it into a class case full of inert gas with gloved hands. I wanted a computer i can take with me, and at this rate, i won't have it for long.

Oh, and it's a pain in the ass to install linux on here. I can't find a distro that supports the wee graphics chip in here, so no 3d for me.

---update: i accidentally yanked the speaker cable coming out the front (a stupid place for a plug) and it pulled the thing clean off my desk. Took a 4 foot fall to a carpeted concrete floor, and IT KEPT RUNNING. It didn't even freeze. Maybe this thing isn't as fragile as i thought.
I bought this machine almost 2 months back. I was looking at buying a lightweight and portable notebook. The notebooks from the more well known brands were quite expensive - typically $1700 plus. And then I saw this Averatec 3250HX-01 at CompUSA. I was impressed with the specs - and especially the 8O GB HDD and DVD burner.

But the Athlon processor was a turn-off. I have always used the latest Intel processors in my machine and I just was not sure about the AMD Athlon processor. A lot of research led me to the conclusion that while the Athlon XP-M 2200+ processor may not rank with the best but it is more than adequate for the job.

Also, Averatec was a brand new to me. Had never heard of them before. They are a Korean company - part of a larger group. Checked with CompUSA, Circuit City, and OfficeMax (Best Buy did not carry the machine then) staff and I heard positive comments from them.

Bottomline, the machine had all the the specs I wanted but the one drawback was the Athlon processor. I'd have liked a stronger Intel processor. Although the brand was new but everybody had positive comments and at sub-$1000 this was the only lightweight and portable notebook I could get. So I bought it.

The machine has lived up to my expectations overall. I have only 3 issues with Averatec on this machine:

1. The 3 USB ports are placed on the right side of the machine. This is an awkward position - which means that my DSL wire crawls all over my table and my wireless mouse stick sticks out outwardly and I have to take care not to hit it when moving the mouse. Also since the USB ports are so close together I cannot use the third port (usually the middle one) when the other two are being used. I have to buy a USB hub.

2. The battery lasts for around 2 hours. Could have done with a longer lasting battery.

3. Beyond 1 hour of usage the machine gets warm, beyond 2 hours it gets hot. And beyond three hours it is very hot at the bottom. Although, the top part gets only mild warm at the hottest of times. I have now used it for as much as 8-10 hours continously a few times, and have had no problems in response times. But I believe its best not to get too hot - so I'm now limiting my conitnous usage to not more than 3 hours.

The software that comes with the machine is OK - although I have not used it much. I am using other software which I have installed on this machine.

The after-sales support is OK. But I am basing this on just one experience. I got thru to the representative after 5 minutes of wait and he was able to guide me.

My net take is this. Buy this machine if you are working on a tight budget and want good specs in a 12.1" machine. Brand conscious people need to look elsewhere.
I bought this notebook a little over 2 weeks ago and has been great. The DVD +/- burner comes in handy quite a bit, something I haven't seen in lower priced notebooks. The screen is small but very very crisp and its far from bothersome. It could do with some legacy support (No Serial or Parallel) but more then makes up for it with the 3 USB 2.0 ports. It's very fast for such a small notebook and so far I have not had heat problems as other people have said, though it does get a bit warm when playing games. Overall this is a great notebook especially for traveling, the built-in 801.11g comes in handy. Averatec says it gets upwards of three hours, the most I've gotten is about 2.5 doing things such as browsing the net via Wi-Fi, word processing, chatting etc. I'd expect a little under 2 hours watching a DVD. The very large 80GB drive is also a plus. Its also very compatible various Linux distro's for any users out their. Tested on Knoppix, Debian, Fedora Core 2, and of course Windows XP Pro.

I bought this computer for a longer business trip. At home I use an Apple iBook G4 but for the trip I needed a Windows machine. Don't worry, I will not be pitching MacOS X against Windows XP, I just will compare the hardware design of two laptops  which cost about the same (US$900) and are similar size (both have 12.1" XGA screens).

1. The biggest contrast between the two is in battery life, the AV3250 lasts a little more than 2 hours (maybe 2.5) under normal use (not playing a DVD, just typing etc.), the iBook almost 4 (both have Li-Ion batteries). Note, that Averatech claims up to 3.5 h and Apple up to 6. If the iBook is not running you can press an external button on the battery and 4 LEDs will tell you how much is left in the battery, the AV leaves you guessing.

2. Secondly, I always thought the iBook gets hot, but only until I felt how hot the AV3250 gets. You can burn your skin. And related: the cooling vents (at least the intake) on the AV3200 series are on the bottom, so if you put this laptop onto your knees or a soft surface you will most likely block them. Soon the fan will kick in at a noise level that will urge you to improve the cooling situation. In contrast the iBook has the vents on the sides and when you open it the screen prevents you from blocking them. I have hardly ever heard the fan.

What else? Both come with modem, wireless and ethernet built-in (the iBook has a nifty uplink sense, so you do not need a crossover cable when connecting two computers directly), both can drive external displays (for the iBook that requires a widely available patch), both have stereo speakers (sorry, but the ones in the iBook sound quite a bit better), the iBook has a microphone built in, the AV has a microphone jack in the front. The AV has 3 USB ports, the iBook has 2 but also a IEEE 1394 (Firewire) port. The AV has a PC card slot, the iBook does not, but since networking is built-in, what would one possibly put in there? And did I mention that the AV fan is very noisy?

Another little detail: The iBook power supply lets you wrap the cable around it thanks to 2 fold-out hooks, for the AV power supply I had to get a strap to tame the cable.

And last not least, the edge of the trackpad on my AV rubs against the screen when it is closed and leaves a 1.5" long mark. Apparently the screen is harder than the plastic housing because the mark can be wiped off, albeit with some effort.

I am not trying to say that the iBook is a perfect laptop, it is Apple's low end laptop after all. But in comparison it is almost amazing how much more thinking went into its design, things you easily take for granted if you have one and you may not miss if you never used a better designed laptop.

Then, if you rarely depend on battery power and keep the AV on a table, preferably without closing the lid (and maybe some external speakers), it proabaly will serve you well.
Well I thought it was a little hot for a laptop so I bought a cooling pad but too late. It died the other night, just six weeks after I bought it. Never have I had such a low quality machine in my life! And they're making ME pay to ship it back to them too! AVOID AVERATEC AT ALL COSTS!!!
I bought this laptop for $799 with rebate. So far it has out performed my expectations. It is fast, small, light and has all the features a road warrior like myself needs. I have had several laptops, mostly IBM T series and while IBM makes an excellent laptop...they are extemely heavy after you have carried them all day in your briefcase. This laptop is perfect and it does everything I need it to do on the road. Some have complained about the small screen...but THAT IS EXACTLY WHY I BOUGHT IT!!! If you have ever tried to open a large screen laptop in a coach seat on an airplane you know what I'm tlaking about. Thanks Averatec...for figuring out what we business travelers really require.
I just recently purchased this notebook and am very pleased with it thus far. First thing I did was remove Microsoft Works and installed Office 2003, along with removing Norton anti-virus and installing McAfee in its place. The computer handled the removal and installs very well. At home I use a wireless router to connect to the internet.  The built-in wireless works well, but the connection quality was weaker than both my PDA (Ipaq) and my roommate's Compaq Presario from the same distance from the router.  The battery life was about 2.5 hours with the wireless internet connected while ripping a few CDs. For $829.00 I find this to be an exceptional value compared to other laptops this size and weight and would recommend it to anyone looking for a budget laptop with nice features.
I found this deal at [...] Headlinedeals.com and ordered the product on Dec 9th as a gift for my wife. It was delivered a few days later. Unfortunately my wife didn't like the product when it was fully revealed out of the package. It is a bit bulky in a 12.1" size. The LCD with a very wide trim edge compare to my 13.1" PIII6000.  I wanted to return it to Amazon, but only to find it is a product from Tech Depot and I can not return it to Home depot either!

I call Tech Depot for RMA number, only to find the following message from them a few more days later:

We have received your request to return the following product:

Avertec AV 3250H1 Athlon XP-M 12.1 TFT

Please be aware that your request appears to be out of policy for one or more reasons. (Only new, factory sealed product is returnable)

For this reason, the request was submitted to management for an exception approval.  Unfortunately, they were unsuccessful in their attempt.

Reason: RD - Refer Direct. Please Contact Manufacturer-which means that vendor name request that all return be handle through them. Please call 408 294-4336

I will call that number later. Anyway, as a longtime customer at Amazon.com, I wished that Amzon.com had not sell this product on the website with hidden policis.

I would rather spend more money at store at Bestbuy or Circuit City because they have better policy regarding return or refund.
I recently bought one of these from Amazon.com.  It appears to be a really nice unit, but it has 1 glaring problem.  The internal wireless network adapter is non-functional.  I was unable to get it to connect to my existing 802.11g network using Windows XP's zero configure support, but I was able to identify it as being a Ralink mini-PCI card, and downloaded (using the internal ethernet adapter, which works fine) current drivers direct from Ralink.  No Go, either with Windows zero configure or using the proprietary software from Ralink.  I eventually disabled the internal card and got a SMC PCMCIA 802.11g card, which works like a champ.  Problem solved.  NOTE:  You must completely uninstall the Ralink driver software if you are going to use the SMC card, otherwise you get intermittent hard crashes -- the machine completely shuts down and reboots spontaneously, every couple of hours or so.
Fast, slim, light and convenient. I miss a parallel port though. CMOS battery went within 2 weeks. Get AVERATEC or Amazon to commit to a warranty - notice that none is posted.
I have a very similar version of this laptop with less RAM.  I love it!!  You absolutely can't beat this laptop even with the ones that cost more than $1000.  The build quality is better than Dell's.  It's light and thin, and the power adaptor is tiny compared to other laptops.  Remember that some other similar laptops might have heavier adaptors.  The cord is also long enough.  My friends with Sony's always have to sit close to the outlets because the adaptors have short cords.
Bought this for Christmas for my wife.
First turned it on and got low CMOS battery warning. Thought it was  because it was first time turning on. Not so, CMOS battery is out.
No support on Christmas.
Otherwise unit seems to work fine. I was concerned about 256K memory, which it shares with the video (32/64/128) but at 32 setting seems to be fine for surfing the web, plaing text twist and solitare, listening to mp3's.
6.8 pounds feels like a feather compared to my desktop replacement unit (Compaq R3030US), and the battery life seems to be in the 3 plus hour range so far, which also exceeds my desktop replacement unit easily.
[...]...got screewed on the [...], I bought it with the $50 one, and then the next there was an additional $100 one that I did not qualify for, and did not want to play around with since it was so close to Christmas.
Can't wait to see how good support is for the CMOS battery. Hopefully something I can fix myself with out voiding the warranty.
Well they wanted me to return it to Amazon for the CMOS battery. When I opened the case, it had come loose during the shipment. Not that easy to put back in place and almost had to void my warranty by removing a sticker to get it back in place.
Then 3 months later the thing dies. Got stuck paying for shipping to them, to find out it takes them 4 - 5 days just to check the unit out before the list anything on the RMA status. I thought I was onto something with this unit, but with prices dropping everywhere I would go somewhere (anywhere) else for a cheapo laptop. This company is not the way to go.
I shopped for a (under $1000) notebook for my wife basically for her digital photos and her Girl Scout files, I was very disappointed in what the local stores had to offer.

PROS:

This laptop looks great, has a nice large keyboard, and the 15 inch XGA display is beautiful with up to 128MB shared memory!

The front 4-in-1 Media Card Reader is impressive and works flawlessly.

It comes with only 256MB ram, but is easily upgraded with PC2700 type (333mhz) 200-pin DDR memory.

The AMD Sempron 2600+ Mobile Processor is quick and pushes this laptop to achieve the desired results (photo editing and word processing).

I turned it the first time and within a few minutes I was already surfing the web as it easily found my router, and my network.

The sound on this laptop is much better than all of the other similarly (and some higher) priced laptops I looked at.

We watched a DVD the first night and had absolutely no complaints (and this was still using only the original 256MB of memory)!

Comes loaded with Roxio CD burning software and Microsoft Works 7.0, and PowerDVD.

CONS:

A bit larger/heavier than what I was originally shopping for, but I couldn't pass up on the great deal. And at 6.8 lbs, it's really not that heavy.

The video is NOT for gaming! But like I said, you'll have no problems watching movies and if you use the S-Video (TV Out) Port on a flat screen... WOW!

SUMMARY:

We have nothing to complain about.

All around great "budget" laptop.

Doubling the memory to 512MB is a must!

This laptop will do everything except render the latest games.

What a Bargain!
This is the best computer I've ever bought. It simply works perfectly. Also, someone mentioned that it's not good for games. Well, that's just not true. Okay, so maybe it isn't blazingly fast and maybe it won't play the absolute most top-notch games, but it plays Quake III, Unreal Tournament 2004, and World Of Warcraft all just fine (with only 256 megs of RAM, no upgrade is necessary). So, as far as I'm concerned, that makes it a fine gaming maching.
After many weeks with my 5500 I agree with existing reviews - the Averatec 5500 is a good laptop for the money (after rebates).  I've used a few laptops over the years, and this one appears quite nice.  Just three additions for anyone wanting a critical review:
1. Although the screen is quite nice on the whole, the screen on my 5500 has slight vignetting (darker shading) at the lower corners.  It's not significant, but it is noticeable.
2. The built-in wireless sensitivity does not match that of my Motorola, AT&T or SMC PCMCIA cards.  This is disappointing when trying to catch an 802.11b/g signal across the house.
3. The touch pad is not as easy to use as others (e.g., Dell, HP).  I've spent a couple hours trying all kinds of touchpad settings, but can't get it to perform as well as I would expect.

 To all three points I say: "What do you expect from something designed/built to be inexpensive."  Four stars for good value.
the reason why windows shows the processor running at 800mhz is because of cpu throttling, your cpu slows down when it is idling or not much cpu power is needed in order to decrease temperatures and save power...  once you start up a program the cpu will speed up to it's max speed.  you can use a realtime cpu clock like wincpuid or amd's dashboard to monitor the processors speed
Better-looking than previous Averatec offerings, the AV5500 is great for web-surfing... and perfect as a companion at the cafe.

The AMD Sempron mobile-edition processor is no slouch, but it's best for Internet applications rather than CPU-intensive programs like Adobe Photoshop or Windows Moviemaker.  Its 256MB of RAM, the absolutely minimum for Windows XP, also means it won't run Microsoft Office well, but is adequate for Internet Explorer, Outlook Express, Windows Media Player, etc.; just make sure you don't run too many applications at the same time, or the machine will feel very sluggish.

As others have pointed out, you should adjust the power option in Control Panel and also download an updated driver to get the maximum performance out of the AMD CPU.  The Averatec is configured to run at battery-saving speed out-of-box, which also means slower performance.  If you have the money, I highly recommend you upgrade the RAM to at least 512MB, for a high-octane boost in performance.

The Averatec is great for the cafe because it has a nice styling and built-in wi-fi.  I do think it's a bit on the heavy side, esp. if you have to lug the AC adapter along -- the built-in battery lasts about two hours with wi-fi on and screen set to mid-brightness (and CPU set to power-saving mode).  On the other hand, it has a big, bright screen (even at half-brightness) and decent keyboard, and its good looks will beat out the Dells and Gateways others have to live with.  It also lets others know you are unique and value- and style-conscious!

Since Averatec is not a major brand (although they are reportedly growing fast), you should probably trek over to Staples or Best Buy or Circuit City and take a look at the physical machine before deciding whether you like it or not.  But for less than $700, you are getting a lot of bang for the buck, and the machines I've had have not developed any problems so far. (Knock on wood!)
I can't believe someone would return this fantastic bargain of a computer over the CPU speed before doing a couple of searches on the web. Granted, I do find this to be weird and I think Averatec should put a guide to doing this on their site. Anyway, let me explain how to fix your CPU speed. Are you excited?

1. Go to the Averatec website and click on "customer care" on the bottom left side. Then go to downloads and download the CPU driver and run the program.

I think this is where some people, including me, got confused and Averatec is to blame. It turns out you're not done installing. You have to goto the next step:

2. Go here:  C:\AVERATEC\DRIVERS\CPU and click setup.exe for the driver. This installs the driver.

3. Reboot the computer.

Now check control panel/system/general and the CPU speed  should read 1.6 GHz as it does on mine now. I'm not sure if it's pyschological or not, because I didn't find it to be that slow before I did this, but it really does seem to be running quicker now - though I'm no expert and didn't do official tests before and after.

If that didn't work, you may also need to do the following:

Goto the power management section of the control panel and change the setting to "always on".

Goto control panel, add/remove programs, and click add/remove Windows components to the left. Wait a minute, then you just click next next until it's finished...

Or try rebooting a couple of times after installing the driver. It didn't work the first time I rebooted but it did the second for some reason.

Anyway, that's it. After that you have nothing else to worry about. I've been using this sweet machine for the past week and have been quite impressed. I can't believe all you get for the money.

The con: the graphic card is awful. Don't plan to play games on it.

The design. This is a beautiful machine. Very bright, sharp screen. And it's ultra thin. It's not ultra light, however, but not overly heavy either. I can't get over the bargain price, really. Amazing.

It's quick, especially after the adjustment, and seems very stable using a variety of applications including Photoshop 8.

The 802.11g 54 MB/s built-in Wireless. This thing is flying online right now.

The built in card reader is very nice. Goodbye external card reader.

My personal favorite is the fan button. You can turn off the fan on this machine whenever you want and the machine becomes dead quiet. That's one of the reason I sold my Compaq, which was so noisy.

TV Out. You can watch all those special, downloaded movies on the TV...

I hope this was helpful. I highly recommend this unit.
Thinking it was time to play catch-up, I decided to buy a laptop computer even though I have two desktop computers at my disposal.  (I assembled my first computer back in 1974). I looked over many laptop computer specifications and finally decided on this Averatec laptop that had the best price along with the specs I wanted.  When I received the computer, I was surprised at how well it was made and I patted myself on the back for making a good purchase.  I tried out all the functions and everything seemed to be just as I wanted it.  There was one little problem, though.  The processor (CPU) seemed to run a little slower than the published 1.83 GHz.  I clicked on system icon in the control panel and was surprised to see that the processor speed was only 798MHz, not 1.83 GHz.  This was less than half the specified speed.  I e-mailed Averatec about this discrepancy, but never heard back from them.

The computer has an AMD Sempron 2600+ CPU (processor) so I went to the AMD website and, with a little effort, found that the processor did have a specified 1.83 GHz clock speed.  I also went to other sources that sold Averatec laptops and was surprised to see that Averatec does not publish the clock speed of the processors they are using in their computers(???).  I liked the overall layout of the computer and its great looks, but I reluctantly returned it because it was much slower than I expected or wanted.  If anyone wants to check their CPU speed and they have a Windows OS, they can click on the following: START -> CONTROL PANEL-> SYSTEM -> GENERAL and read the CPU value.  I hope you won't be as disappointed as I was.
Nice budget laptop, similar problem with processor speed mentioned in other review, runs 800 mgz full capacity of AMD Semperon 2600 should be around 1800 mgz. I  called Averatec, and basicaly got no answer . Also don't like LED's under left typing hand. I gave it 4 stars becasue of these 2 problems.  I have read that Semperons use "  800mhz hypertransport" architecure?? what ever that is, and that power increases as needed. If that is the case I wish Averatec would get up to speed on their product and maybe provide a bios upgrade?
I bought this laptop for my girlfriend so she can do her home work,  but i was expecting to play some games with it too, but i could't.

The video adapter doesn't have a 3d accelerator, it only supports direct X, son you can play some really lame games.

I like the thin desing, it's light, and it looks very good, it runs very nice, there is no heating problem, like other laptops out there.

If you want a entry label laptop, this is a good choice.
Since there is $150 rebate on this model which brings the pric down to $680, it is a reasonable price to pay to entry level laptop so I just bought one. This is the review after I have used this laptop for several hours. The reason I rate this one as 4 star will be explained shortly. I have previously used IBM T40 so many comparisons will be made against this model (yeah, IBM T40 is far more expensive and supposedly better, but ...).

I will start with the good aspects.

1. 15 inch bright LCD screen. The screen's quality can rival many entry level standalone LCD monitors. The viewing angle is sufficient, although not great (certainly not 170 degree as many LCD monitors exhibit), but better than T40's, which gets a very narrow viewing angel. Narrow angel means that when you look at the screen at certain direction (not straight front), screen exhibits color/brightness distortion.

2. Silver metallic look. Look more cool than a pure black one.

3. 3 USB sockets at parallel placement. T40 has 2 and they are placed one on another (plugging two at the same time will be a minor hassle).

4. Builtin 1396 firewire.

5. Very quiet hard disk operation. I can hardly notice any noise from it - on the down side, I don't know how much disk activity is going on. T40 and many desktops have very noticeable noise.

Now comes the short sides.

1. Very mediocre sound performance especially from the headphone output. There is even noise coming out of that which indicates poor shielding of electronic components and wirings. T40's audio performance is so-so but it does not have noise at least. So don't expect to listen to MP3/CD at high quality from the builtin audio output.

2. The default CPU speed is at around 800MHZ, roughly half of what the CPU can deliver. I have to change power management option to let it run at full speed after I notice it is not that fast.

3. The default memory is only 256MB. It is not really a thing to blame since at this cost, it is unlikely it gets more. Expect to spend another $80-$100 to buy 512MB memory to get a reasonable performance (I noticed the hard disk spins all the time if multiple apps run at the same time).

4. The keyboard does not feel as good as T40's, but not too far away and too bad. Just acceptable. Location of PgUp/PgDn/Home/End is very different from others, so it takes sometime to get use to.

5. The default action for the laptop to enter into hibernate mode when you close lid is very inconvient. It should just turn off LCD monitor and do nothing else (that's T40's behavior). So I have to change that through Control Panel.

6. It does not have similar thing as tracking button like IBM T40 does. It is a small button you can massage to get very quick mouse movement - an extremely useful feature if you don't want to use an external mouse.

7. The mouse tracking area's default behavior is very counter-intuitive. When you tap on the tracking area, it takes that as a click on the mouse button. I got this wrong almost everytime and had to redo many stuff. It is difficult to use and easy to get wrong. This is a feature that should not be turned on by default. Fortunately I can turn this off.

8. The LEDs for disk/battery/wireless/etc. information is locatedd at left bottom side (if you face the screen). This is an area usaually covered by your left hand and you can not see them if you are typing. Why can't they be put on a forward location? That would be much easier to see.

9. Again on the same area - like most other people, I wear a watch on my left wrist. And the metal band just wears down that area quickly - only after a couple hours' use, I can see scratches. Either Averatec should use a stronger paint on this or they should just put a plain stronger plastic without paint.

So given the money I paid, I will keep this laptop since none of them are critical, and I will get use to them eventually. I have not used the service so can not comment on it. A 4 star rating should be what this laptop deserves. If you are just looking for an entry level laptop, and don't care about these shortcomings, then this model is just right for you.
If you're looking for a decent laptop but don't want to spend a lot of money, this is a good choice. I'm usually one to go for the popular name brands first, but decided to take a chance. With the included [...], this laptop is a bargain. Aside from some relatively minor  issues (screen isn't as clear as it could be; keypad a little on the noisy side and could be arranged better), I can't find (yet) anything to complain about. However, be warned: if you're looking for a laptop with a huge amount of memory, a top-notch graphics card and an enormous hard drive, this is not the model for you. But if your needs are modest, this is a good buy!
My first computer was a Wintel and so were my second, third, and fourth. My brother decided to take the fourth one away from me just a couple of weeks ago, so I had an opportunity to buy a new computer. A few of my college friends were boasting about their Apple Powerbook G4s, and being the Wintel user that I've been all of my life, I was curious. I did a lot of research - looked at reviews, literally studied every tech specs on the Apple Powerbook website, asked around, etc. Then, OSX Tiger came out that week and every tech website that I went to was boasting on and on about how wonderful this  new operating system is. I decided that I HAD to give it a try and so I did!

My Apple Powerbook G4 15" came last week with an additional 512MB ram (1GB memory total) and I have to say, I'm pretty satisfied with it. Everything is amazingly easy and I love the dock! All of the programs that I use daily are only 1 click away and it makes my desktop looks uncluttered as compared to my Windows XP's desktop. Everywhere I've taken this baby, people have been amazed as to how thin and beautifully designed this is! Compared with other laptops, this baby is extremely light too! To think, my dad, who wanted me to stay with Wintel, wanted me to buy an 8lbs. Toshiba laptop. For my very petite size of only 5'0 and a little under 100lbs., I don't think I would've been able to carry that Toshiba in a shoulderbag around school. In addition, Apple makes wireless connection so easy to install and use! My friend, who owns an iBook with the same Airport installed in his computer says it's so easy to steal other people's wireless internet with an Apple. I don't know if this is true for Wintel laptops, but immediately when I'm near a place with wireless internet installed, my Airport automatically "discovers" it for me and I don't have to enter any usernames or passwords or anything! That's how easy it is. Not only does Apple make wireless connection easy to use, but a lot of Wintel users don't know that Mac is not as vulnerable to viruses as they are! About almost 75-95% of viruses created are made to target Windows users. This is why you don't hear any complaints about Macs affected by viruses. Now, isn't that wonderful?

However, I do have some minor complains though. First, this laptop DOES get pretty warm if you set it down on a flat surface or on your lap even because of the aluminum metal. Just make sure you don't wear short shorts and it shouldn't be too hot or purchase a laptop stand. Secondly, I do miss the right-click option on Wintel a whole lot. Now, I always have to CTRL + CLICK everything if I want to right-click and it can be a chore sometimes.

During my first week that I got this Powerbook, I was wondering why my battery life was so short since I only used iTunes, iChat, and Safari, and Airport wireless at the same time. I did some research and found out that the best way to maximize your battery's energy span is by FULLY DISCHARGING it, LET IT GO TO SLEEP, and PLUG IN THE POWER ADAPTER and let it charge until FULL. This should only be done once during your first week with your battery or any new battery. I've also read that if you're not using Bluetooth or Airport, remember to disable them so that you don't waste any energy.

All in all, I'm very satisfied with my Apple Powerbook G4. I saved $200 with the Apple Education discount so if anyone is planning to buy one soon in the near future, remember to take advantage of the discount (even if you're not currently enrolled in school; just pick any school - a school your children go to or a school that you went to and you'll still get the discount)!  It cost me $2,050 total including the 1GB memory upgrade and tax altogether when it should've cost me $2250-$2300. This is a great investment and I hope any Windows user with curiosities about switching to Mac should go to the Apple store and try it out for himself!
Like another reviewer before me, I too have owned Macs for 20 years [at home].  I also have worked with PCs at work for the past 20 years as well.  I have watched and worked with the evolutions of the hardware and the operating systems.  Both Wintel and Mac products have been, more or less, just fine.

I just purchased a month or so ago from Amazon.com [a good point of sale] a Powerbook G4 1.5. and of course Mac OS 10.3.8.

Yes, there are Wintel laptops that offer, at a higher price, brighter, sharper screens.  Yes, there are laptops that offer, at a higher price, slightly faster operations than the Powerbook.  But, if you combine the solid "feel" of the hardware with the absolute elegance of Mac OS 10, you have a combination hard to beat.

The more I work with this system, the more I am impressed.  Two quick examples: I am studying Spanish and trying to practice writing sentences.  Lo and behold I discover that OS 10 allows me the option of changing my keyboard from English to Spanish [or German or any one of scores of other languages] and thus I can type the Spanish punctuation [upside down question marks, for example].

I also had occasion to set up bluetooth devices on a PC and on my Powerbook.  With the PC I had to insert a CD, go through a relatively elaborate set up process.  It worked just fine, but with the Mac, there was no driver set up needed, just a 10 second "pairing" process and the blue tooth mouse was scampering across the table top.

These are not "assets" advertized or promoted.  I just discovered them and I feel like I have a lot more pleasant discoveries ahead of me.
I'm just a regular person with no training in graphics or computers. Apple has changed all that. I used PCs all my life and now realize that I wasted my time & money. PCs will never compare to Apple, and frankly, I don't undertand why people bother. I thought buying a G4 desktop was the best purchase of my life. But this powerbook (PB) is an even better purchase. Since I've bought it, I have totally (and I mean "totally") ignored my G4 desktop. I do all my computing from the comfort of my couch. I do everything wirelessly. Apple's OS X is unbelievably stable. This PB is great for the user who enjoys using higher end digital equipment and software. Apple software is simply the best. The graphics intense power simply sits on your lap. iPhoto is easy to use and with a .mac account, you can share your photos on the internet in just a few easy minutes. With music, garageband allows me to plug in my guitar and record my music. Then I use gargeband to add some bass, drums and other instruments. I then save it in iTunes and post my music on the internet where friends can download my music onto their iPods. I'm not even a good guitar player but garageband turns me into a musical genius. As for digital movies, I download my footage into Final Cut Pro and edit my movies while sipping latte at Starbucks. I then use my PB to burn my movies on a DVD and share them with friends and family. And I'm just getting started! As life goes on, Apple continues to improve and so do I. I highly recommend this powerbook. It will change your life...
I am using this Apple laptop for some time and thought its time to right a quick review. Apple as always famous for excellent design did a good job here as well. Few things I love about this machine
1. Very attractive look
2. Backlit keyboard to use in the dark (my favorite feature to use on the plane)
3. Good stereo speakers
4. Excellent screen resolution
4. Plenty of ports (Ethernet, Firewire, USB, speaker, telephone, etc.)
5. Built in Bluetooth (I think it's the best way to connect to cell phone)
6. Built in wireless (both 802.11b and 802.11g)
7. Lots of printer/scanner work well with this out of the box
8. Slot loading CD/DVD drive (I have DVD writer which works amazingly well and fast)
9. Built in Modem
10. extremely easy to change battery or memory, if you need to

Only two things I didn't like about it
1. Heats up fast and stays warm (and I read that its very bad for men to use a warm notebook keeping on lap)
2. Wireless connection lose some strength (about 20%)

As you see both the issues are because of the Aluminum case but it gives gorgeous look so I am ok with them.
I've owned Apple computers going all the way back to the Apple II+. Along the way, I have had the very rare bad apple. However, this PowerBook G4 worked great right out of the box. It was nice to find it fully charged and ready to go. These days I'm not really a 'power user. I'm not crunching any serious numbers or even much game playing, but I still appreciated the crisp speed of the 1.5GHz processor. I can see a noticeable difference between the 1.5GHz and my old PowerBook G4 500MHz. I also like the keyboard and how it lights up in darker rooms. Finally the PowerBook hasn't lost any of its coolness. I still get people commenting on how cool it looks. I have to say that this is one of the best Apple Products that I've owned in over 20 years of owning Apple products.
I have had this computer 2 days now.  It is just amazing.  It arrived from amazon charged and ready to go.  In 10 minutes I had it fully set up (it is _so_ simple to set up) and was surfing the web from my hotel.

Right now I am typing this whilst listening to the music from my ipod on it!!

I never imagined a computer could be this easy to use.

The only thing the other reviews didn't mention is that it is ready to go faster than I open the screen when coming up from sleep mode which is great when you just want to look something up.

If you have an ipod then you know how easy apple stuff is to use - just get this!!

Battery life is great - it shows the remaining time in the top right corner of the screen - I am getting over 4 hours.

I bought my PowerBook about a month ago, and it is simply the most wonderfull tool I have ever purchased. It has replaced my DVD player, my video game consoles, and my PC based music production workstation. I upgraded to 1Gig of RAM and bought an M-Audio FastTrack USB audio interface - the end result being an extremely powerfull and totally portable recording workstation. Of all the music setups I've had in my life, this is by far the best. To set up the audio interface all I had to do was plug it in - no drivers, no wizards, just plug and play.

All the buzz about Macs is completely true. OS X just makes everything easier and more fun, the system never crashes, the included software is incredible, and despite the clock speed discrepencies between the G4 and Pentium 4, my PowerBook trounces my Dell P4 2.6GHz! Also, be advised that spyware, adware, malware and virii are not isues on a Mac, and Apple's included web browser (Safari), mail client, and IM client are all at the top of thier respective classes. If your considering a Mac purchase, and want a portable, I believe the PB 15" is the best of all worlds as far as size, features and shear power (the 12" dosen't give you the screen real estate required for audio or graphic editing, the 17" is just too big to lug around comfortably and safely). Get one, you won't be sorry.
Got this laptop about a month ago. Runs great. it's light, it's thin, battery lasts about 3 hours, and it has plenty of power. I play World Of Warcraft on it all the time, and it runs great. I purchased word/excel/PP for it for $150 extra, and that solved all my compatablity issues with PC/MAC. If you want a lightweight, high quality laptop, then this is probably the best deal out there.
I love this computer.  It works, and that was about all I needed. I returned a Dell that made me miserable and I'm much happier.  I think it is a little slow for watching movies, but other than that, no complaint.
This is a very in-depth review, so if you want to get to the point I suggest skipping to the last paragraph.

I might not have much to say that hasn't already been said several times over, but I wanted to give my take on this laptop as it's can be a difficult choice to make and perhaps I can be of some help.  When the Air was released I thought it was the height of frivolity for Apple, but I've since come to understand it better.  I spent eight days getting to know it in the standard 1.8Ghz/64GB SSD configuration and I'm still wavering on whether or not I want to keep it.  I'm writing this review on a MacBook Pro that has been configured to be almost the exact opposite of what you'd get with the Air.  When I bought the Air I wanted to see if I could handle such immense limitations, being so used to the freedom of maxed out laptops and desktops.  As I'm writing this, the answer is "kind of."

The MacBook Air, in my opinion, is ridiculously expensive.  It's also ridiculously cool, especially when it's closed.  In fact, every time I found something I didn't like and soon closed it to let it sleep, I had difficulty hating the thing because it's just so cool when it collapses to be a thin sheet of metal.  Every little nuance of the outer design is elegant and perfect--visually, that is.  There are a some hardware flaws that may or may not upset the user, and one that, in my opinion, throws the machine's worth into question.  Let's deal with that first.

As someone who thought he used several USB devices, I found that I really do not.  I might use two at a time, namely when importing footage from a video camera into the computer and saving it to an external hard drive.  An important thing to note is that while the Air is certainly not made for video editing, it manages nonetheless.  It can be done and it's not as horrible as one would imagine.  Having one USB port also works just fine in pretty much every other case.  I did get a tiny hub to use with the Air, but as it's tiny it's not a nuisance to carry and generally doesn't get carried around anyhow.  If I'm editing, I'll usually edit at a home (not mine, as I'd use a desktop machine at home).  Although it can get by, I would never recommend the air as a video editing machine.  This probably goes without saying.  Still, it's good to know that it can if it has to (even with Final Cut Studio's lack of support for it's integrated graphics processor).

Many people conclude that the Air is impractical as the machine does not have an optical drive.  If you live by CDs and/or DVDs, then yes, it probably isn't practical for you.  I never use my optical drive in my MacBook Pro.  If I want to watch a movie, I rip it first.  Most people do the same with their music so I don't think it's fair to cite this as a reason you'd need an optical drive.  This does assume, of course, that you have another machine with an optical drive.  If you don't and you want the Air as a primary machine then you will absolutely need to purchase the optional Super Drive Apple offers.  You might think of going with a cheaper drive, such as the ones Lacie makes (which are good), but I wouldn't as even the Air, with it's added USB power, cannot power them.  The one Apple offers doesn't cost much more and is worth it if you have no other machine.  But if you do and you don't want to travel around with a drive (like me), there's another nice solution that I found worked very well.  I bought a few 8GB flash drives, which are comparable to the speed of a DVD (if not faster) and hardly cost anything these days.  I loaded the MacBook Air's installation media on one drive and made it bootable so I could restore the operating system or boot from the media while traveling should the need arise.  I used one drive to hold a few movies I wanted to watch and another for any vital software I would need to install should I need to ever wipe the Air's drive while traveling.  I bought four 8GB drives but only used three to do all of this.  For less than the size of three fingers you can easily prepare for the worst and bring along some entertainment.  If you want to bring along several more movies and music, an iPod is a good choice.  You can always hook it up to the Air and play the movies/music through the machine.

I wanted to save it for last, but it makes sense to address the biggest flaw of the machine now.  As I've said, this is not a video machine.  It can be a video machine under very specific circumstances, but it is not, apparently, designed for use with any video at all whatsoever.  I say this because of how the Air handles heat.  The graphics processor (GPU) warms up rather quickly, even if you're just browsing the web.  Watching video on the Internet, or even on your hard drive (perhaps something you downloaded from iTunes, generates quite a bit of heat.  When the machine grows too hot, the first thing it does is underclock the GPU.  Imagine watching a movie at about 1 or 2 frames per second.  This is what you can expect when the Air gets too hot.  If this wasn't the case, I wouldn't be so conflicted over the machine.  I can let go of doing any heavy media work with it, but I can't let go of being able to watch a TV show without it skipping.  You can work around this terrible design flaw by giving the air vent plenty of room to breathe.  What I did is put the sleeve I purchased under the Air and then rested most of the air on it.  I let the back section, with the air vent, hang off the edge so it had space to vent.  This worked perfectly when the Air wasn't hooked up to external power.  When it was, it became a problem.  It was an issue on an airplane, though, and the short power available on the flight may have been feeding more power into the Air than it should have.  The Air exhibited some strange behavior when plugged into the power port on the airplane, rendering the trackpad pretty much useless.  The Air seemed to hold up just fine, when it had breathing room, when plugged into a normal outlet.  Nonetheless, this trick is annoying and is even required when the Air is on a desk or table (though you'd get through a sitcom without any trouble if it's on a desk).  The computer should be able to play back an MPEG4 or H.264 file without skipping, throughout the duration, without special treatment.  If you have no interest in doing anything with video, watching or otherwise, this won't be a problem for you.  I just can't imagine anyone using their laptop these days without watching some sort of video online or on their machine.  I see this as an enormous drawback and will be the main reason I return the machine, if I decide to do so (and it is what I'm leaning towards).

But moving on...

Perhaps disk space is a drawback?  I thought it would be for me, but I found that I only used about 25GB once I loaded on everything I felt I needed, including my entire music collection (which is only about 9GB and not the norm, I'll admit) and photo library.  I also loaded about 3GB of e-mail, Final Cut Pro, Final Draft, Adobe CS3 (without Illustrator and InDesign), Episode, VisualHub, and several other pieces of software.  I installed almost every piece of software I have on my MacBook Pro and left off the things I've either never used or used so rarely I forgot I had them.  I didn't miss a single thing.  I certainly use the majority of my MacBook Pro's 250GB disk and have so much data on external drives, at home, that it would scare you (I never throw anything away), but in terms of what you actually use I'd bet you'll find you can fit it on a 64GB or 80GB drive very easily.  You did a few years ago, right?  Perhaps you're still doing it.  Either way, there's an easy solution.  Buy an external hard drive.  Some might argue that this is sort of counter-intuitive as the point of the air is to be pretty much non-existent.  Adding things goes against that mantra.  Well, yes, but again you can leave this drive at home or where you're staying.  When you're walking around with the Air you don't need it.  When you go back to your hotel, your friend's house, or wherever you're staying, you can pull it out of your other bag (the one you used for clothing, etc.).  If you're at home, well, then you certainly have somewhere to put it.  Rarely will you have to take it with you and it's not like it's that big if you do.  I have a couple of Western Digital 250GB Passport drives (in black, if you're wondering) and they're great.  I don't see drive space as a drawback at all.  It's a problem easily solved.

There may be questions for some if the SSD is faster than a standard hard drive.  For random tasks, yes, very much.  OS X is good with caching common tasks, such as launching applications you use often, so while application performance is definitely faster via SSD the crappy little 1.8" iPod hard drive the standard model has will not slow you down too much once the Air gets to know your habits.  Startup isn't as instant as everyone says, but you can immediately use the machine after startup.  I'd much rather have an SSD over a hard drive as the speed increase is very noticeable, but my main draw to the SSD version of the Air was for data security.  It's just less likely to die and that is very appealing to me.

Speaking of death, battery life is what you'd expect from an Apple Laptop.  In fact, I might call it both better and worse.  During my tests, I went to a coffee shop to write for a few hours.  I left with about 30 minutes left on the battery, having used it for two and a half hours (give or take ten minutes).  I wasn't playing music, browsing the web, or anything at all.  I had the wireless off.  The only issue is that I was in direct sunlight and countered it with the display at full brightness (which is completely and wonderfully visible).  For a battery rated for five hours under wireless use with the screen not much dimmer than full brightness I was a little disappointed that it only made it what I assume would have been three hours without wireless.  Nonetheless, I rarely use my laptop without plugging it in so it's good enough for me.  Still, I fully intend to use the battery more once they figure out how to make it last a full day.  Imagine that...

The power cord is so small you can easily take it with you.  Actually, it's really not that small if you think back a few years when we used to have G4s.  It's terribly small compared to the existing adapters and the way the mag safe attaches is so much nicer than it is on any of Apple's other laptops.  It doesn't fall out by accident, still comes off easily, and doesn't get pushed out of the way by your knee/leg when the machine is on your lap.  I hope this is how all Apple laptops are powered in the future.

I have nothing to say about the micro DVI port because I haven't used it.  I suppose I could, but I assume it works fine.  There's not much to screw up.  One thing to note about the ports, though, is that despite the beautiful little hatch they're housed in they are a bit difficult to use.  It requires slightly more concentration than the average port when plugging something in.  It's not a big deal, but it might be a bother at times.

The built-in speaker is awful, but everyone knows that by now.  It's a single channel speaker.  If you're the type who watches movies with friends on a 13" laptop this might be a problem.  I don't know any people like that who don't do so at home and plug in a pair of speakers they have lying around.  If you're by yourself, you have headphones.  I wish the speakers were better but I don't see this as a drawback.

The keyboard is a pleasure to type on and the backlight is far more effective on the Air than it is on the Pro.  The keyboard also seems to be better-crafted than both the standard MacBook and the the wired/wireless keyboards (I'm typing on a wireless now).  I don't know how that could be, but it is.  Maybe it's just because it's new and I'm now used to typing on the "chiclet" keys.

While a little heavier than you'd expect, the Air is fairly light.  I think the main thing to look at, when considering weight, is if you can safely hold it when gripping with one hand (without fear for your wrist or the laptop's safety, or both).  The Air has no problem in a single-handed tweezer grip and your wrist will be fine as well.  It is as minimal as they say it is and will pretty much fit into any bag you've got.  I thought I was going to need a new bag but found that it fit into an old one I usually carried when deciding NOT to bring a computer.  That was a very pleasant surprise.

Still, despite the fun of it and all the nice little benefits it has I cannot get over the situation with the heat and the GPU.  It really ruins the machine for me.  I think that, regardless of whether or not this will be a second computer you can make the determination of whether or not to buy fairly easily.  If you were once a boy scout (meaning you always like to be prepared) and/or you've recently told yourself that you need to clean, get rid of stuff, or simplify your life, you will have trouble with this machine.  There will be things you won't like, perhaps to the end that you won't keep the machine.  But if your life, in terms of technology and other things (literal), is already simple and you don't dwell on preparedness too often, you'll probably enjoy this machine very much.  If all I did was write, or all I did was write code, or all I did was write school papers and surf the web this would be an overpriced but very capable machine.  I kind of saw it as the writer's dream machine, which is why I got it (I'm moving into that field primarily, now), but I have too many interests for the Air to handle.  I might just keep it because I'm currently overpaid and I wouldn't mind it as a backup/travel machine, but I'm mostly feeling it was the wrong purchase and I'd be better suited by a cheaper, standard MacBook for a backup laptop (especially since I can mirror the data and I love the black MacBook).  While I absolutely hated it when it came out, I've since found that it really is a machine well-suited for certain kinds of people.  If you've got the money and intend to be gentle, it's probably a good choice for you.  If your laptop is a third arm, I'd suggest holding your breath for a year or two.

UPDATE:
I have good news.  I decided to keep it and turns out that I had a bad machine ("had" being the good news).  I took it in because the trackpad clicker button didn't work very well and they gave me a brand new machine (very, very nice of them).  Not only did that resolve the problem I took it in for, but I no longer get horrible choppy graphics when using the computer on my lap/in bed/when the vents are partially blocked.  While I've heard gaming won't survive under those conditions, this is a MAJOR improvement for me.  If I could, I would change my rating to four stars.  The Air pretty much does everything I'd want it to at this point and the solid-state disk makes the majority of things I do much faster than the standard 5400RPM hard drive I have in my MacBook Pro.  I judged the machine too harshly in the review because I thought I had a model that worked properly :).  I am very pleased with it now that it can do what it should be able to do.  I'm looking forward to finding out if it can even handle some light video editing.

Also, I got a Transcend 32GB flash drive as a supplement.  So far I haven't used it for anything than taking a bunch of movies and TV shows along with me, but it's a nice alternative to a traditional hard drive if you don't want the bulk but are concerned about the spacial limitations of an SSD.
I've had my Macbook Air for over two weeks now and it continues to amaze me. I bought it to replace an almost 5 year old 17" Powerbook and the first thing that struck me was how light it felt on my lap. It's almost like it isn't even there. I bought the 64 gig SSD version and the second thing that struck me was how cool the computer felt. Literally. My Powerbook would become uncomfortably hot after a while but the MBA remains cool the whole time I use it. This may be a function of the SSD not having any moving parts but it certainly is welcome, especially for prolonged web-browsing on the couch.

Several other things make this my best laptop. First, it wakes up in a snap when I open the lid, although it does take a few seconds to find the wireless network. As others have mentioned, the screen is bright and absolutely gorgeous. I was a little nervous about these 52 year old eyes reading on the small screen but no problem at all so far. Watching downloaded movies and TV shows is a pleasure. The computer is plenty powerful for my needs. I use a laptop for web-surfing, watching videos, Office type applications and making presentations and the MBA is just fine for this. I have an Imac for heavier duty applications like Photoshop and video creation.

Last week I flew with my MBA on commuter planes, the ultimate test for any laptop. It was great replacing my heavy Powerbook with something so light and easy to handle. I didn't do any work on the plane (I find it hard to work while flying) but I did watch videos and the computer opened up sufficiently to allow me to enjoy what I was watching. Plus it was easy to store under the seat for takeoff and landing. And as an added benefit, two flight attendants came up to me to ogle my MBA and chat with me. That never happened when I had a Dell!

I bought the external DVD drive and used it to load some software. The lack of a built-in drive is no issue for me. Neither is the port "shortage". I've never had more than one USB device hooked up to a laptop at a time anyway and I don't need Firewire. So Apple's compromise is no compromise at all for me.

So if your needs are like mine I'd urge you to strongly consider the MBA. It's pricey in my configuration- although I did get the 10% education discount available through Apple- but if you plan to keep it for years like I do it's less of an issue. It's light, stylish, highly functional and fun to use. What more can you ask for?
Let's start with the negatives.

This laptop is not for everyone.

Obligatory Disclaimer to the savvy consumer: this laptop is a don't buy.  First of all, it's a first generation product.  NEVER buy a first generation product.  The only people who should buy this laptop are the people who can shrug if they lose the thing.

* There are limited ports.  In fact, there's only one.
* The battery is not replaceable.
* There is no integrated Wi-Max.
* The battery life is on par with current generation Apple laptops.
* It's "underpowered" in this generation of overpowered desktop-replacements.

Consumers who worry about the above, but still want to run a variation of OS X may purchase this:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Apple-MacBook-MB063LL-B-13-3-Laptop-2-2-GHz-Intel-Core-2-Duo-Processor-1-GB-RAM-160-GB-Hard-Drive-8x-Super-Drive-Black/dp/B000GA7048/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Apple MacBook MB063LL/B 13.3" Laptop (2.2 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo Processor, 1 GB RAM, 160 GB Hard Drive, 8x Super Drive) Black</a>&nbsp;Or this:<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Apple-MacBook-Pro-MA896LL-A-15-Laptop-2-4-GHz-Intel-Core-2-Duo-2-GB-RAM-160-GB-Hard-Drive-DVD-CD-SuperDrive/dp/B000R7Z2YU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Apple MacBook Pro MA896LL/A 15" Laptop (2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, 2 GB RAM, 160 GB Hard Drive, DVD/CD SuperDrive)</a>.

Or simply get the Thinkpad X300 and run it on a last generation OS.

But I gave this 5 stars, why?

* It's beautiful.
* The build is solid.
* I can carry it in one hand with no effort.

And here's the thing about the lack of ports.

* Peripherals will eventually all be wireless.

Bluetooth peripherals are already in the marketplace (obviously where Apple hedges its bets on).  Products like&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Eye-Fi-Card-Wireless-2-GB-SD-Memory-Card/dp/B000X27XDC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Eye-Fi Card, Wireless 2 GB SD Memory Card</a>&nbsp;will become the norm.  Laser Printers can be run on wireless networks.

And why pay $1000 more for a lower memory Drive?

If you can't afford it, then don't!  But consider this in two years:

* SSD will be the standard for all future laptops.

This price will definitely go down in future renditions of the laptop and will no doubt be the standard in 2 - 3 years.  Not only will the price fall, but the speed and quality will undoubtedly increase too.

I've had every laptop hard drive fail on me throughout the past 5 years.  No more.  The reason why the military invests in SSD is in their stability.  I "needed" stability in my laptop HDs, and I "wanted" it now.

This laptop is ahead of its time.  People shouldn't kid themselves.  It's the equivalent of having the option to own either a Ferrari or a Toyota pickup (Apple apparently recommends both i.e. wireless CD access).  They accomplish the same thing, but the former's capacity is limited by legal speed limits.  Not only that, the former is vastly expensive to maintain and has limited applicability.

Both is better, but if you had to choose?

This laptop is the same thing.  And I love it.
The MacBook Air is an amazing piece of technology to be sure. It can do most everything that it's big brothers, MacBook and MacBook Pro, can do. All in a thin, three pound package.

But this machine is not for everybody. It's for someone who already has Mac tech somewhere else in their life and want a pricey, portable addition to that tech.

If you're using this at home and the office, you'll need at least one Airport Extreme to get your WiFi going. You'll also need to have a sharable Mac, or an external hard drive or external SuperDrive. One of your WiFi devices should probably be the new Time Capsule so you can quickly back-up the system since 80gb probably won't last long these days.

Apple usually stays a step or two ahead of the industry. This time, they may have taken a giant step too far.
I am a software developer (java/eclipse) and I can't say enough good things about my powerbook. The only reason I wouldn't give it five stars is because these machines would do better with 2gb of ram and a 7200rpm hard drive.

If I personally owned my powerbook I would upgrade it myself as apple does a great job documenting how to go about such an upgrade.

I have not used the .Mac account, but I have heard some good things about it.
I had my previous Apple computer in the early 80s...a Mac Classic.  Then on to Windows 95, 98, some time with NT, and XP in the corporate environment.  I have used Dells, Gateways, Fujitsus and Panasonic Toughbooks.  Each computer needed some sort of virus program..and then another utility to manage the operating system...and another to back everything up for the blue screen of death.  With each new application it got slower...and slower.  Tired, stale, consistant, blah and increasingly frustrating computing experiences.

I got my daughter an iMac and was blown away with all the capabilities for enhancing the digital experience.  So I just got a 2.33 PowerBook Pro with 3GB memory and and 200GB hard drive and glossy screen.  I am in heaven...

The visual experience is quite awesome, and with the lighted key board, you can stay up all night and type away.  I have been a pilot for 15 years, among other things, and know something about glare.  If you hold it just right, you can see yourself in certain lighting conditions, like when you are having breakfast and the sun is coming up.  It is a nice reflection of a smiling person enjoying thier MacBook.  If you are going to be doing a lot of work in digital photography or watching DVDs...the glossy screen is just wonderful.  If you are going to see how much abuse your nice new computer can take so you can brag about it...just go ahead and get a ToughBook.

For a number of corporate apps, I downloaded Parallels and a fresh copy of XP.  It is unbelievable.  Download the software, insert the XP CD...and shazam...you have XP running faster than you can believe.

Go to the Dell site, and load up a 15" laptop just like the MacBook Pro for yucs...the Mac is actually cheaper.  And I like Entourage a lot better than Outlook for doing the daily contact managment.  I am just now getting started organizing the digital photos, but have loaded 3000+ into iPhoto.  I have 15 years of photos to scan along with various formats of video...so that is an upcoming experience.

Battery life is only 3.5 hours with a really brite screen setting and no conservation settings...and no, I cant cook an egg due to heat.

Oh, and for backup?  Just sign on with .Mac, fill out the preferences and forget about it.

For me, this is the most brilliant computing device ever made.  I have a Cingular PCMCIA data card which doesnt fit, so that is a bit problematic for awhile...but everywhere I used to need the data card I can get wireless coverage now...

This is the first review I have ever written, because I am having such a wonderful time with the product.  Go ahead Neo, take the red pill and get on with your digital life.
Just purchased and received my MacBook Pro.  One-Day Shipping was only $3.99 with Amazon Prime.  I wanted to let other buyers know that this MacBook Pro comes with the ANTI-GLARE SCREEN.  For those who prefer the GLOSSY, look elsewhere.  The Amazon Rep didn't know and the product description didn't specify this info.
i maybe one of the few users out there that had to chance to own both the Core Duo and the Core 2 Duo within 2 weeks. i bought the Core Duo first but after a week the keyboard and track pad stopped functioning so i took it to the Apple guys to see if they could fix it and they couldn't. they told me that they would swap it out for free (normally they charge a 10% re-stocking fee) and it just so happened that the Core 2 Duo was released...so that's what i ended up getting. lucky huh?

CD = Core Duo: older Intel processor

C2D = Core 2 Duo: newer Intel processor

PB = Power Book: older Apple laptop

MBP = MacBook Pro

MB = MacBook

physical build...this machine is perfect. it's about the same size as the G4 PB's but thinner. first thing i couldn't wait to try was the magsafe power adapter cause i can't count how many times i've tripped over my old PB's power cord. works as advertised! besides that, there isn't much of a design change from previous PB's except that they switched the battery placement, the ram slots are located by the battery, and the air vents that were located on the side of the old PB's are now gone. CD's and C2D's have the exact same body and build. same full sized keyboard with wayyyy brighter backlighting, so bright that i kind of hurts to look at it sometimes. there was only one magnetic latch to close the laptop now on the MBP's there are two. makes it more secure i think? can't really tell the difference. you get the standard two usb 2.0 slots (located left and right), a two fire wire slots (located on the right) one fire wire 400 one 800 (located both on the right) and the usual ethernet, headphone jack...etc. only gripe i have is that i wish they put more usb slots on there...

operationally sound...unlike the first release of MBP's that moo-ed and mysteriously shut off the new C2D's (at least mine and what i've heard so far) are problem free. this baby is quiet, in fact, you'd really have to prop your ears next to the air vents to hear the fans whir. i've only heard the fans kick on once when i had it on my lap playing a dvd and photoshopping at the same time. there were some issues with the CD's not being able to sleep when you closed the screen, well this one plops to sleep like a kid who had a big day.

performance is great...if you're coming from a PB to a MBP like i did then the performance gain can be measured in leaps and bounds. start up is amazingly fast, there is no more lag when due to the significant increase in processor speed and ram speed. C2D's can be upgraded to 3 gigs of ram only due to chipset limitations but i'm pretty sure 3 gig's would cover over 95% of what people need. (ie: Photoshop, internet surfing, music playing, dvd burning...etc)  the new video is great as well, ati x1600 with 256 mb ram pretty much ate everything i threw at it. supported dual monitors (your laptop screen + another monitor) right out of the box without a hiccup. i ran a dvd on one screen, photoshop on the other and everything purred along fine, no screen lag. if you're comparing C2D's to the CD's then the performance gain isn't really noticeable...trust me, don't feel bad if you're one of those that was just outside of the return period when the C2D's came out. Apple also stuck a new wireless card in there that has the new n-wireless standard...ironically, it's not usable yet on OSX but if you have bootcamp, Windows is able to use it's n-capabilities. battery consumption is pretty good too me but your mileage may vary. i take notes in class, chat and surf the internet when i can't understand the professor...overall i get around 4 - 4.5 hours of usage.

software is elegant...this is probably just something you have to experience for yourself. Mac users will know what i'm talking about. literally everything, well everything that i've tried, have worked without a hitch. MS Office is a must if you're a college student otherwise everything you need is pretty much pre-loaded in the box.

overall...if i didn't get this upgrade for free i wouldn't be quite as happy as i am now. it was painfully obvious that the first release of the MBP with CD processors was pretty much just a MacBook with a bigger screen (1 inch bigger) and a dedicated video card. i didn't think then such minor details would command a $1500 premium. it was literally a battle between how long before Apple incorporated the C2D and how long the consumer was willing to wait. that in my opinion was a low blow. if they tout the MBP's as their top of the line notebooks then they should have made it so that it was significantly different from the regular MacBooks in the first place. i mean, if Toyota started making their sedans in Lexus quality...who'd wanna get a Lexus?

it get's only 4 stars due to the following reason...

- inadequate chipset that can't utilize 4 gigs of ram. just seems like they're cranking out whatever they can for the holidays to rake in the cash. hardware doesn't seem as meticulously thought out as it used to be. i mean, a month down the line when they have the new chipset that CAN use 4 gigs of ram you can bet there will be a lot of customers complaining again.

- the video card, while very decent, is hardly anything to write home about. again, for a top of the line notebook you'd think they would have used something better. to be fair, they probably were thinking about battery consumption on this one. but still...

- i wish they had some sort of extended battery pack included or as an option. i mean, the 4 hours of usage is good but on a day where i have 8 hours worth of classes...well you get the picture. starting to sound like a broken record but again, for a laptop that is around $2600 when everything is said and done, is that too much to expect?
I've owned 11 Macs over the last 7 years, most of which I bought for family members.  4 of them have been my primary computers.  During this time I've also used several Windows based PCs, as I work in a Windows only business.  It is great to have a Mac that also does the work stuff.  I haven't yet been able to find anything I don't like about this notebook, which is something I cannot say for any other computer I've ever owned (Mac included).

Here are the biggest pluses I can think of at the moment:
-Beautiful 17" widescreen with a resolution that is perfect for the size
-Leopard OS is simply beautiful and the easiest OS to use in the universe
-Plenty of Hard Drive space
-Plenty of RAM
-Fast processor, good video card
-802.11a/b/g/n
-HUGE trackpad (great for photo editing or network engineering layouts)
-Backlit keyboard makes typing in the dark a pleasure
-Less than one inch thin
-iSight built-in is perfect for my travels ... I can always see my wife and son (my wife has a MBP 15")
-Office 2008 is every bit as good as Office 2007 for Windows
-Spotlight, spotlight, spotlight!  If you don't know what this is, Google it! :)
-Expose
-iWork 08 is nearly a replacement for Office 2008
-Scrolling built-in to trackpad

That's about it for now.  I hope this has been helpful.  This is the most perfect notebook I've used to date.
The Apple MacBook Pro was advertised as refurbished and with Microsoft Office. It did not contain Microsoft Office and had to be taken to an Apple service center to be repaired. I returned it for credit two weeks ago and have not heard from Amazon.
Very Good Quality and I love the mac. Much better than a PC. Great item and service.
This system is dangerous - you could start enjoying computing so much that you forget you are working.  The attention to little details adds up to more than the sum of its parts.  The keyboard is quiet, lights up, and feels good to use.  The battery meter tells the truth and gives time remaining or left to charge, not some vague percentage.  The system is not plagued by constant viruses and spyware.  You can focus on getting your work done without the stressed out feeling of constantly battling your system or fearing that something will randomly blow up on you.  While it takes some getting used to, the power user will discover that everything they need is there and they do not need to buy 10 other products to get the job done (all of which introduce performance and other problems).  The bottom line is - at $200 a pop for a complete and stable OS on 5 systems, or $600 for unlimited server licenses, you save money on maintenance, filling in capability gaps, and grief counseling that you would spend on a PC.  Parallels really does an excellent job running Windows if you need it.  Unix is right there under the hood with robust, stable, well thought-out capabilities that do not compromise security or performance.  You will enjoy it.  Buy it.  It isn't perfect, but you will appreciate the genuine quality and be glad you did.
This is not the last model, but only change the video card...  not a big deal.  for this price is the best choice.
More polished vs. same spec HP nc8400 series notebook I use at work. Quite satisfied. Love the magnetic power connector.
It is the dream machine. Looks great, works wonderful, and has all the wireless option one needs. It is the best Mac I have owned since the 80s.
And possibly my favorite. Apple trumps Microsoft yet again.

As a side note, I bought mine from Apple as a refub for $1499. This exact same model too. Way overpriced here.
The macbook pro is very fast, has a beautiful screen, and has an excellent unix based operating system. Installing windows to use your old windows aps is quick and easy with boot camp. has a very polished look to it also.

Its achilles heel lies with noise and heat issues, which seriously hurt its mobility. The machine runs HOT, with processor core junction temperature shooting up to around 80 C at times. The bottom surfaces of this machine also become unbearably hot after prolonged use under a processor load. Fan also becomes incredibly loud (far lounder than my Thinkpad T42). In addition, the superdrive makes far more unpleasant noises than the average notebook drive. When I took it to the mac store, I was told that everything was ok with my macbook, and that I should stop using my laptop on my lap in the future -_-. These problems really hurt the mobility of the machine. Given the price, I expected a more polished design. Was far more satisfied when I got my thinkpad T42 a couple years ago.
I've worked with both PCs and Macs professionally, but this is my first Mac for personal use. The quality, speed, clarity, design, hardware - well, simply everything - is phenomenal. All the benefits of a Mac, plus the benefits of a Windows system thanks to Parallels Desktop. All my PC software works on my Mac - how convenient (and fiscally smart) is that? This is far and away the best decision I've made regarding home computers, and that's saying a lot as we've had them in our home for 20+ years now! Happy, happy, happy.
I strayed from the path for a number of years and suffered the Windows consequences. What can I say? I wanted to be compatible. This computer brought me back into the fold. With it and the underlying Intel processor, you can be compatible when you need to be, which these days isn't often. The web has brought us all together. This computer is fast, quiet, has a great display and lots of extras that only Apple delivers, like:
- The magnetic power cord that prevents you from pulling your computer off your desk, table, or tray table.
- The DVI connector that allows you to use your flat panel monitor at full resolution as an extension of the built-in display.
- A backlit keyboard that helps you see the keys in dim light.
- A built-in camera that let's you take pictures of yourself for web sites, passports, etc.
- The ability to create PDFs from almost any file without buying Acrobat Pro.
- Built-in address book, email, calendar, web site builder, music simulator, movie editor, etc.
- And more that I've forgotten.
In fairness, I did have a problem with this computer - bad memory - that caused me to take it for an overnight stay at my local Mac shop. Since then, it's performed flawlessly. Why get the Pro instead of the MacBook? Bigger display, accepts more memory, metal case, magnetic power cord. This is the best computer I've ever had and I suspect it will be that for you, too. Once you join the Mac crowd, you'll wonder why you suffered for so long...
I thought Martin was the only one and then I met Mac, my MacBook Pro. This is my first-ever computer. Yes, I have roamed with the dinosaurs and rubbed sticks together for fire until now. Mac is the first thing I think about in the morning and the last at night. My world has opened to locales I never knew could be so easy to access. Martin is a long time PC fan. Poor boy..doesn't know what he's missing. I'm still learning all the in and outs, but I've got the internet, iTunes, and creating my homepage down to an art. Next is webcaming to Martin in Tasmania. I can't wait. Thanks Mac!!
I just received my new Macbook pro 15" last week and I am nothing but impressed. The finish on it is amazing and It looks spectacular all around
here are some key points that I really enjoy or dislike

Pros
-Looks Great
-Battery life is the best out of any notebook I have and the battery remaining time is pretty accurate.
-Built in eyesight is very fun and clever.
- I love how light it is
-I can go on but this will be a very long list

Cons
-My biggest peeve about this whole transaction was that Amazon shipped the item via UPS which wasn't a problem to me. But when I received the package it looked like they kicked my $2,500 computer around. Now this probably is not Amazons fault, but i called anyway to let them know and they couldn't care less. Overall, I would probably NOT buy from amazon ever again.

-The screen could be just a tad brighter
As usual the service from Amazon is perfect. I am very impressed with the Mac system and find it far more efficient than using Windows...pity I took so long to make up my mind..Tiger X is leagues ahead of Windows in terms of features and simplicity...
Very, very fast, quite and beautiful - a fantastic machine!  It works with all my peripherals, and you will not believe how easy is editing movies with this beauty.
I am very impressed with this product.  Although I have barely started tapping into all of the amazing software on the macbook pro, I feel like I will get a lot out of this computer.
Best laptop I have ever used hands down. Good bye  Windows, and especially that horrible Vista (Aka Windows ME version 2 aka crap). The construction quality is unbelievable in this laptop. It runs cool, the screen is amazing (looks like peering into an aquarium!), it's fast, stable and just a beast! I've been using computers since 1994, and I got my first laptop in 2000. Blows any HP or DELL laptop out of the water, without a doubt!
I love it and recommend it for a PC user wishing to switch over.  I'll list the reasons to buy this is no particular order.  1.  Use Parallels and it works great... just need more ram.  2.  Easy installation of software and drivers.  3.  the software is great...especially if you want to start doing videos for blogging, imovie, iphoto, and idvd are top notch programs.  Well worth it.

It only comes with 2 512 chips with no room to expland.  I recommend the upgrade at time of purchase.  It'll save you 170.

I purchased from amazon with apple care and prime next day.  It came perfectly.
This is my first MAC!  I have been threatening to "Go MAC" for 20 years.  When my Dell Latitude D610(2GB RAM, 7200RPM DRIVE, 1.7Mghz ) became just unbearably unreliable (3 repairs, 2 replaced parts and 4 re-installs from scratch in 1 year) I bit the bullet, as the saying goes and bought a MAC.

First, most of my experience with this machine has been quite pleasurable.  (I have had my MacBook now for 1 week.)

1. Watching DVD's and listening to music have been excellent!

2. Setting up my Airport express took 7 minutes!

3. My machine turns heads!  It is quite smooth.

4. I LOVE the Itunes experiece with my Airport Express--I have been waiting for something that would let me stream music to my sound system with out issues for a loooong time.  I will next buy the Airport Extreme and Apple TV!

5. I love the night light feature! I use it every night.

6. MIGHTY MOUSE rules!

HOWEVER,  I have some issues with it.  (in order)

1. The lid keeps closing on me when it is inclined--this is about 40% of the time--VERY irritating.  The "genius" says they can't do anything about it.  "It is the big screen--its heavy"--BALONEY!

2. It runs HOT!  I thought my Dell ran hot.  But since this is a aluminum case used as a heat sink, it really gets hot--very uncomfortable.

3. The front edge requires a wrist rest or it cuts into your wrists.  That HURTS!  They sacrificed comfort for looks---not good.

4. The "dual displays" referred to in the ads are one external monitor and your laptop screen.  NOT 2 external displays.  I had planned to use my two 20" monitors with a port replicator--no dice.

5. The system fonts in native resolution for many apps are TOO tiny..  like 6pts..  THAT sucks eggs.  Changing the resolution to a lesser one makes things look fuzzy.

6. There seems to be something wrong with the trackpad click bar-- I have to click it several times to get it to accept repositioning of my cursor.

7. My cursor retains the insertion cursor far too long--when it should be a pointer.

8. Upon waking from sleep mode my machine makes some "staticky" hiss on the left channel.

9. I got a very loud short feedback like sound that scared me the other day when I drug a file from the Windows window to the Tiger desktop.  What in the world was that!?

These, now that I write them out, need to be voiced to Apple.  I will do that.  They represent- I am sure--an unacceptable user experience for Apple.

For $3 grand I should not have so many complaints--valid complaints at that.

I won't be returning it--I don't think.  I need the speed, simplicity and reliability?.

WE WILL SEE.....
---------------------------------
EDIT: March 27 2010--
 Update: I love it more than ever!

PROS: All former complaints have been addressed except what is noted below.

CONS: -Wish they had allowed more RAM upgradablity and user upgradeable hard drive.
  -Flimsy case. Easily damaged.
  -Sharp edges at wrist rest still annoying
  -Runs hot--but not as hot as it used to.  I use iStat (free) from [...] to monitor temp and fan speed.

Super value!  After 3 years, my machine still whoops most machines out there and will run anything I throw at it with ease--multitasking is really good, thanks to Snow Leopard 10.6.2.

Snow Leopard has addressed many minor complaints I developed over the years that I have owned it.

It is now what it should of been when I bought it.  I will add details later.  My next machines will be the i7 or i5 based uni-body machines--one 13" for my wife and one 17" Pro for myself.  Plus April 2010 2 iPads Wi-Fi, then when available the 3g versions.  I have a Iphone 3g, I get a 3Gs in May 2010.

Even though I must maintain my PCs for work, I prefer my Mac Snow Leopard with VMWare Fusion for XP and Win7 over a straight PC.

All-in-all, I am now firmly a Mac Man. I no longer recommend PCs to anyone.  I only recommend Apple. Staunch believer.
I purchased a MacBook Pro online with Amazon (actually sold by Amazon). Received it very quickly, it has been functioning perfectly well and I'm waiting for a [...]. So this was a very successful experience.
I have been using PC's for many years.  Never an enthusiast with PC's and the matience they always seem to require.  I have always found that with a PC unless you spend the big bucks you are going to suffer in the long run.  This computer is wonderful.  It can run several applications without slow down and feels more and more at home to me.  I choose an apple for it's speciality programs but also for it's superb OSX operating system.  The commercials are true.  This computer is relatively free of problems and seems to make life easier.  When I try my desktop and find myself waiting five minutes just to get online I become frustrated.  Simple tasks take forever on a good PC that is a few years old.  Although it has been a problem since the beginning.  With seemingly several programs that start at the same time the computer does it becomes a real problem.  I don't have to worry about that with this MacBook.  I choose what program I want to start and it starts.  I have seen the light and there is an Apple at the end.
This is the ultimate laptop.

This MacBook Pro model is fully loaded, including its camera, reasonable speakers, a comfortable keyboard, fast processor, RAM, Hard Disk Space, and even a remote control.  I tried to build a comparable Windows PC on Dell, HP and Lenovo sites.  Those machines always ended up with a higher price than the MacBook Pro (MBP) because of all of the upgrades required to get equivalent equipment and software to what is included on the MBP.

 I love the Mac OS (10.4.9) but also have limited needs for Windows-based software.  I tried using Virtual PC on a G4 iMac but found the performance painfully slow.  Finally, I gave in and bought this machine.  It really is like getting 2 computers in one.  Using&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Parallels-Desktop-for-Mac-Intel-Mac/dp/B000GHIV2Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Parallels Desktop for Mac (Intel Mac)</a>&nbsp;with&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Microsoft-Windows-XP-Home-Edition-FULL-VERSION-with-SP2/dp/B00022PTRU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Microsoft Windows XP Home Edition FULL VERSION with SP2</a>&nbsp;I am able to have Windows functionality while still using all of the other great Apple software.  Don't forget to download the latest version of Parallels, as there have been significant improvements and fixes to the software since the version which is in the box.

For Mac devotees this is a great machine, but for someone who still needs to keep one foot on each side of the OS fence, this laptop is truly amazing!
Fantastic...Love it! Does everything I need it to with the most intensive applications. Apple is right on both with design and function.
Switched over a year ago and am never going back to a PC!
Good product but delivery was a little slow
Ive had my Macbook Pro for about 4 months and am extremely pleased with every aspect. It is far more powerful than previous portable macs (the dual core processors work no doubt),and the extra screen space is a big help. The screen is bright and sharp,  the battery life is solid, Though I typically use it near places where I can just plug in. Bottom line, if You can afford it, its worth it.
At first, my dad got me an Acer laptop, which crashed within a month of my getting it. My mom, being the practical one, decided that I needed a Mac. They went to CompUSA and got a full refund for that worthless hunk of plastic. When they came home, they said that it turned out I couldn't have a laptop, then they grinned broadly and uncovered a MacBook Pro. I was delighted. I sat down and turned it on. From the moment I saw the welcome screen, I knew I had a winner on my lap. That was in 2006.

It's now 2007 and my MacBook Pro is still the best computer in the family. The only change is some additional software and a RAM upgrade to 2 GB. I love my Mac. I use it every day and whenever I show my projects to Windows users, they freak out, saying how I must have spent months reading books about how to do that stuff. I tell them that it was easy - at least with a Mac. Whenever I use a school computer, which has Windows XP, I can't believe how incredibly stupid the designers must have been. There's all sorts of programs that came with my MacBook Pro that the school AT brags about having bought for the Windows XP computers. Furthermore, those programs that came free with my MacBook Pro are much better than those that had to be added onto Windows XP and costed scores of dollars each.

I think that if you're a frustrated Windows user, but you think you can't get a Mac because of incompatibilities, you NEED to get a Mac. Trust me - I do all my schoolwork on my Mac and it comes out looking gorgeous. If I need to transfer it to a school computer, I just click the export button. For instance, I did a report on Pages. After I was done, I clicked File -> Export -> PDF -> Continue... Then I chose where to save my PDF, I waited 10 seconds, I saved it to my USB memory device, I plugged it into a school computer, and voila! Also, I love making presentations in Keynote. After I finish, I export the presentation in PowerPoint format. Finally, the DVDs you can make with iDVD are, to be blundt, absolutely gorgeous. I did a documentary for school in iMovie HD, I set up a main menu with iDVD with Play Documentary as the button you select to play my documentary, and I burned it to a DVD. When I presented it to the class, everyone gasped when they saw how professional my DVD looked. I even had credits at the end of the documentary, just like the Hollywood movies. I got an A, of course.

Here some facts about the programs that come with any Mac:

Address Book- You can import and export contacts from most email clients - very handy. Also, it is fully synced with Mail so you only type a few letters of someone's name and then Enter to make them a recipient.

Automater- If you're doing the same thing over and over again, stop that right now. Take 30 seconds, give or take, to tell Automater to do it. Wait another 30 seconds and the whole thing is done. It's like having your own little robot inside your computer.

Chess- Play chess with either the computer or a friend on the other side of the world. Mac has had this for two years now and Windows Vista, which just came out, is claiming to not have copied this feature. Right. I've used both OSs and Vista's Chess is almost identical to Mac's. Hmmm...

Comic Life- A doodler's dream. You can make your own comics and then print them out. Very professional looking and easy.

Dashboard- The definition of convenience. Read news, control iTunes, play Hangman, squeeze a whoopie cusion (my personal favorite), check the time, calculate a number, type on a virtual Post-it note, translate something into another language (very useful for me since I live in Japan and I don't speak Japanese), look up the definition of a word, etc. [Also, in Mac OS X v10.5 Leopard, the next release of OS X, you can make your own dashboard widgets; this will be similar to making your own gadget on your iGoogle page]

GarageBand- Record your own music, edit it, group it into tracks, put it on iTunes for all users to download, make your own CDs, etc.

iCal- Solution to a busy person's dream. Automatically color-codes your appointments based on what category they fall into and shows events as a visual block of time, bigger for longer events, smaller for shorter events. Syncs with your iPod so you can check your calender, for instance, in Starbucks when a colleague asks what time would be best for a meeting. You can subscribe to people's calendars online so their events automatically appear in iCal. Includes a To-Do list, sorted by priority.

iChat- Social person's dream. Text-chat with anyone, and you hear a little noise when they say something so you can work while waiting for a response. Audio-chat with anyone and you can talk like you're on the speakerphone. Best of all, video-chat with anyone, go into full screen mode, and you feel like you're sitting at a very reflective table, talking to all of them. [Coming in Leopard- present Keynote presentations and other documents to people via iChat. They also see a little icon of you, narrating the presentation. Also, you can add a backdrop so it looks like you're, well, anywhere you want to be. Finally, you'll be able to use those Photo Booth special effects on yourself while video conferencing.]

iDVD- Is it Hollywood or is it not? That difference will be very tiny when you make a DVD with iDVD. You can choose what music to play in the main menu by simply dragging the song name from the media browser onto the menu. Also you can select whether to have a widescreen or standard orientation for your DVD. Finally, you'll be able to navigate the DVD's menus just like in store-bought Hollywood DVDs - with your DVD remote. All functions of a regular DVD movie are included with iDVDs. They work with any DVD player.

iMovie HD- Again, is it Hollywood or is it not? You can add high-quality special effects to your movies and you can even use your built-in iSight camera to record yourself. You can also adjust volume levels for music or narrations to play at. Add transitions between pictures and videos. Insert the perfect song. Narrate the whole thing to make a documentary. Et Cetera. The bottom line is that you'll be able to show friends a Hollywood movie and your movie and they won't be able to tell the difference.

iPhoto- A reminicer's wildest dream. Use professional tools to make your photos look simply beautiful. After you've done that, make a photo album. Design your own greeting card. Make a calendar for your kitchen. Prepare a slideshow to show on your television, via the Appple TV. Once you've done that, click Buy. Your creation gets shipped to your front door (or someone elses, if you want) and it has been printed on top-quality photo paper with the best ink availible. As simple as 1-2-3.

iSync- You can syncronize your contacts and calendar with your Bluetooth-enabled cell phone. Very convenient.

iTunes- Easily find and download millions of songs, albums, movies, TV shows, news report podcasts, etc. Also import music from CDs and manage your iPod.

iWeb- Your one-stop-shop for making gorgeous Web sites. For example, a Web site I spent a few hours on looks ten times better than the one our school AT has been working on for years for our school, using Windows.

Mail- Leaves Outlook in the dust. Automatically sorts your mail into different folders and lets you instantly search your entire mail history.

Photo Booth- Take pictures of yourself using one of sixteen special effects and then either email them, set them as your iChat icon, or import them into iPhoto for editing and other things.

Sherlock- Just like its namesake, it's a one-stop-shop to find ANYTHING on anything, including on your computer, a network, the Internet, or anywhere else you need to.

Stickies- Post-It notes you can leave anywhere on your screen. Variety of uses.

Activity monitor- the Apple version of the Windows Task Manager, although this can show you the current status of every hardware component of your computer, including current RAM usage and hard drive usage.

Grapher- Wonderful tool for algebra students. Type in an equation, exactly as it appears, and it graphs it for you. Save the graph as an image, find the coordinates of any point on the graph, etc. Also, you can type in data sets. Finally, you can choose from five different appearences for your graph.

Printer Setup Utility- Hub for every printing device connected to your Mac, its current jobs, its ink levels, its specifications, etc.

VoiceOver Utility- Reads whatever text you want it to. Choose from a couple dozen different voices for your Mac to read in.

When I saw the price for this laptop, I told myself that no one would buy it because it's too expensive. After an entire year of flawless performance and wonderful results, I reversed my opinion. This Mac was worth every penny, and you'll agree, too, once you push the On button.
I used to be a PC chick.  This MacBook Pro does it all.  You definately get what you pay for.  Pricy  but so worth it.  Once you switch to Mac, you will never go back to PC again.
Ok if you are reading this then you are curious about Macs. Well first off I must have spent 6 months looking at all the notebooks I could find, reading reviews and testing notebooks at the store. Owning this computer is like a dream come true. Its smart, intuitive, creative and beautiful. It has exceded my expectations and im only just begining to understand all of the cool editing features for videos, pictures and music.  If you Really think Vista is the way to go then do the test. Try it out then play around with a Mac and you will be just like me...long time PC user who went Mac and never went back!!

I also picked the 2.16 for the longer battery life and cheaper price.
A sentence like above's was written on the first page of the ridiculously small user's guide. And it came to be more than Apple's vanity: for me, it was absolutely true.

There's so much to say about having a MacBook Pro at my fingertips... Every aspect of it seems to be chiseled by angels. I didn't enjoy a laptop trackpad before meeting this, with that nice two-finger scrolling feature, which brutally beats the scrolling wheel of my Bluetooth mouse and those clumsy trackpad scroll bars found on most laptop PCs.

The keyboard is literally DELICIOUS to my touch, and that keyboard backlighting feaure is pure genius. Its aluminium case is both beautiful and resistant. And, of course, there's the issue of REAL SPEED, courtesy of the 2.16 GHz Core 2 Duo. Besides, Mac OS X is a truly reliable operating system, free of those virus menaces that plague Windows. The iLife suite is amazing.

There's nothing you can't do on this nice computer. Do yourself a favor: simplifiy your life, and buy a Mac.
First off, I'm a long time PC geek. I've built dozens of PC systems over the last 12 years. I do games, audio, web and graphics development, work - until last month, I was all PC all the time.

With that said, this is one of the most solid, stylish, functional and FUN - yes FUN - devices I've ever owned! The performance, usability, feature set and reliability is peerless and I would be hard pressed to find such touches as a lighted keyboard, magnetic AC power, built in camera, hard drive drop protection, firewire 800, Express card, auto dimming LCD, Ati x1600 graphics, Wifi, Bluetooth, DVI, slot load superdrive, included media remote and the plethora of software features as standard in a portable, affordable PC package. Just wow...

And for other PC holdouts who think Mac's are overpriced, proprietary and hard to use - listen close: This thing runs XP and Vista like a champ! I can play Battlefield 2142 at 60+ FPS in XP! Just download Apple's free beta bootcamp, follow the simple instructions and install Windows as you see fit. But to be honest, Windows on a Mac is a novelty - you can do just about anything in OSX minus PC games obviously. I've even been able to install some of my must-have mobile work apps in OSX like Cisco VPN and MS Remote Desktop to connect to my Win XP work machine. With the upgraded 200GB hard drive, I've been able to hold all my MP3s, pictures, garageband projects and squeeze in a little World of Warcraft action!

My gripes with this machine are very superficial and barely worth mentioning. The case is aluminum so it gets fingerprints easily, the speakers sound better than most laptops but aren't multimedia grade. Also when running on battery, the tilt or drop sensor is pretty sensitive and will not-so-gracefully shut down your machine if suddenly jostled. The biggest issue I've had so far is if I grab the corner of the machine while burning or reading a CD/DVD, the case flexes enough to actually grind the spinning disc! I ruined a music CD that way, but hey the drive still works...

Even with those minor quirks, I'm very happy I traded in the virus-laden, hot, heavy and generic PC desktop replacement notebooks for this fun, light, fast, sleek and highly mobile Mac. And if the Apple engineers keep up this kind of hardware and software quality, I'll keep buying!
An Apple USB External Modem is required to connect to the internet if you have dial-up internet service.&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Apple-MA034Z-A-External-V-2-Modem/dp/B000C6TLDO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Apple MA034Z/A External V.2 Modem</a>

I purchased a bluetooth wireless optical mouse that easily sets up and wirelessly connects with this computer.&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Logitech-V270-Cordless-Optical-Notebook-Mouse-for-Bluetooth-Mouse-optical-wireless-Bluetooth-bright-silver/dp/B000ECXBQY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Logitech V270 Cordless Optical Notebook Mouse for Bluetooth - Mouse - optical - wireless - Bluetooth - bright silver</a>. I prefer this to the trackpad.

I am enthralled with the iLife '06 software package that comes with this computer. You can store and organize your photos (iPhoto) and music (iTunes), make your own movies (iMovie) and music (GarageBand) and even create your own website (iWeb) with blogs, photos, music and movies. I found that with a little instruction, I recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-Macintosh-iLife-06/dp/0321426541/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The Macintosh iLife 06</a>, I was able to easily put together a website of my own.

I have not been able to locate a word processing program on this machine other than the 30-day free trial of Microsoft Word. It appears that to design publications for printing, an additional program is required.

I highly recommend this product.
Design: I've had this Macbook Pro for 2 weeks now, and I'm still loving it.  The design of the system is excellent.  The trackpad and keyboard are the BEST I've ever used; very smooth and accurate.  The battery life is very good especially with the excellent power saving features of OSX.  This computer always feels ready to go.  The illumianted keyboard is awesome.

Heat: Heat was one of my main concerns because of all the reviews about it.  While transcoding video I have been able to get the notebook to heat up.  The portions above the keyboard have gotten hot, but not hot enough that I couldn't touch it.  I have seen the fans were running around 3000-3500 rpm during this time.  I could not hear any considerable noise difference from the fans.  I do not use the notebook on my lap, so I can't speak to that regard, but the heat levels seem completely acceptable given the amount of processing taking place.  The hotest spot feels to be right above the F6.  The left hand rest area is body temperature warm due to hard drive activity and the right hand rest area is cool since the DVD was not running at the time.

Value: I have been looking at getting a Macbook for the past 6 months.  I repeatedly compared hardware to hardware of other venders (i.e. Dell, HP, Sony, etc.)  The price/hardware ratio was always comparable to the other venders, and often times less.  The value of the hardware for the money is very good.

Software: This is my first Mac, and so far I'm am very pleased.  I am a long time Linux user, so I'm comfortable having a UNIX based OS, and all the opensource software I know and love works on this as well.

I have zero complaints about this product, but if I HAD to be picky I would request that the very cool remote was bluetooth instead of IR. :)

GREAT JOB APPLE!!!
Well, I converted to a Mac. The past couple Dells and the Sony Vaio had served us well, but Microsoft was seriously bogging us down with security updates and the like and I needed a fresh approach to my computer life.

If you have Comcast service, the setup is not the best. Comcast has some quirky setup issues. My Belkin wireless router actually had a help item on how to set up with Comcast.

The power of advertising does work. What you see in the Apple commercials is what I felt like between the PC and Mac comparisons. The bloated PC - that was me. The cart full of PC errors - that was me. The easy going Mac - that is me now.
I am incredibly happy with my Macbook Pro.  I switched to Mac last year and I just now upgraded from a Macbook to a Macbook Pro.  I personally believe that the regular Macbook suffers a speed impediment from the low quality integrated graphics.  The screen on the Macbook was really great for a compact screen, but this 15" is dreamy and is large enough to do anything you'd want to do.  I dual boot into Windows, run parallels, and I just go crazy on this fabulous machine.  Yay!  If you are reading my review, you may like to know that Mac core 2 duo's are 802.11n upgradeable, the Core duo (without a "2") are not going to be 802.11n upgradeable.
I am a longtime Mac owner who has used Windows for years at work. Since December I've been using a Thinkpad R52 for my consulting gig. The R52 is a beast of a laptop and mine has 2GB of RAM, yet apps were always hanging and crashing for no apparent reason. I continually felt like I was trying to run in a vat of molasses. Last week I finally hit my limit and decided to replace my iMac G5 with a Mac laptop that I'd use for both personal stuff and work. Yes, this meant that I would be spending my own money on a work laptop when I could use a Windows PC for free, but I no longer cared.

When I received the machine, I started putting it through its paces and was somewhat nonplussed. I was used to the 20" iMac with its huge screen, and the high resolution and relatively large screen size of the R52. The display felt somewhat limiting. However, the more I used it, the more I noticed how darned fast it is and how quickly I was getting things done in OS X and universal apps (save for the Mac version of Lotus Notes, which is a dog even on this machine). Now I don't even miss the real estate at the bottom of the screen.

In short -- and I know this sounds goofy -- the more I use it, the more giddy I get. Not only is it faster and more reliable than the computer I was using, it is also considerably lighter. For someone who travels more than 75% of the time, that is a huge deal.

This computer has already exceeded my expectations and there is much more that I plan to do with it. MacBook Pro, $1999. Sanity -- priceless!

5/15/07 update:  The shoulder strap on my laptop bag came loose today while I was pulling my laptop off the floor of my car. It landed on the ground with a sickening "thud," and sure enough, when I took my laptop out of the bag, there was a big dent in one corner. The frame near the charging port is bent, and the case won't shut properly. It only fell a couple of feet, and no way should there be this much damage from one little mishap. I'm really sad that I'm stuck with this damaged case until my next upgrade. I can't imagine how this case would hold up to constant travel either. I have to lower my review to three stars.
To be honest i find my new macbook pro kind of sexy actually i love it, its has everything i need, lots of persons asked me if i have troubles with the compability between windows and mac and to be honest i don't have any and i don't even care about windows any longer ths is the future is simple is great is mac.
I've used IBM compatible PCs for over 20 years and never, ever, ever thought I'd buy an Apple.  But when Vista came out, I spent hours trying to decide which PC, version of Vista & Office 2007 to buy.  (I use Word, Excel & Publisher fairly often.) I was ready to buy an HP laptop when I learned that the screen wasn't covered by any standard warranty.  On a whim, I visited the Apple store one night and was blown away with the capabilities and simplicity of the MacBook Pro.  Some of my favorite things include:

1.  It saves a lot of time because it boots up so quickly . . . and goes to "sleep" so nicely!!

2.  The "hot" corners of the screen are great for productivity too

3.  It easily connected to my wireless network at home

4.  The magnetic power cord is a smart innovation

5.  I like the integration of iTunes & iPhoto (I loaded in some of my favorite CDs and then transferred most of my photos from one of my PCs.  On the PC, we had photos scattered everywhere, but I know EXACTLY where they all are on the MacBook!  And I love the way you can integrate the music into a slideshow.)

6.  As a PC user, I thought I'd have a hard time understanding the Mac environment.  But the Help files have been great. I also called Apple once (when trying to secure my home wireless network) and got a charming service rep from Canada who gave my lots of tips.

By the way, I ended up buying Microsoft's Office for Mac (work, excel, powerpoint & entourage) and have been happy.

All in all, this was one of the best decisions I've made in a long time!
My MacBook arrived 48 hours ago.  Previously, I have used Window's Based Laptops and Computers. I decided to buy a MacBook Pro based on my reading of the many positive reviews written at this web site.  During these past 48 hours, I am learning why this machine is highly rated.  I have had a very short learning curve switching from XP to OX.  I purchased a MAC wireless key board.  It worked as soon as it was turned on.  I am uncertain if I like the feel, especially sitting in my lap, but it worked as soon as it was turned on.  No drivers to load, no other set up required on my part.  The mighty mouse arrived today.  Two or three commands, clearly listed in the directions, and it worked.  No discs, no drivers, no searching for a driver.  I struggled with the internet connections at work and at home (DSL).  However, for work, I eventually found an "automatic" command for connecting to an ethernet based network, and it worked.  At home, I had to learn about PPPoP, took me two tries, but it worked.  I do miss a blinking light on the ethernet port, letting me know that a live wire is plugged in.  I obtained MS Office for MAC thru my place of work.  It download smoothly.  Learning the changes is a little slower, but it appears to run better and certainly is very fast on this machine.  I used Foldershare to mirror my files on my other three machines (yes I have 3 XP based machines).  The 20,000 files have been transferring smoothly throughout the day.  I use a Zire 21 and I downloaded the Palm Desktop, which I like.  I had to learn about *.sit files.  Took about a half of hour of my time and several attempts to unpacked, but once I figure it out - it worked.  I paid an extra $1,000 for the privilege to own a MacBook over competitive machines with Vista.  I consider my time worth $200/hr.  I have already saved 5 hours from fighting with XP, waiting for virus scans, and trying to get plug and play equipment to work.  Thank you Apple, and thank you Microsoft - I recall that you purchased a portion of Apple during one of its low periods to help keep it in business.
i am actually writing about the powerbook 17" models made in the W8 shanghai factory, which are experiencing a major screen malfunction about 14 months after purchase.  there may be no evidence yet that your macbook pro will develop a problem, but apple is clearly not making the quality products i have known and loved since the 80's.

worse, they are refusing to acknowledge the problem hundreds of us are experiencing (to see images of our screens, visit [...]) and just deleted most of our posts on the apple discussion boards.  those who can afford the $800+ repair are even experiencing defective replacement screens.

presumably you will be safe- i think apple won't consider a recall because they no longer sell powerbooks- and i don't want to rain on anybody's parade, but at least buy extended coverage and check to see where the product was made.  good luck!
If you are in any artistic field, you should get this machine. I am running Windows XP and OS X, and it's working perfectly. So some of you need to use programs that need to be run on Mac and PC, this machine is the best for you. I had to upgrade ram upto 2 GB to make more smoothly, but it was cheap because I upgraded myself. It's really easy. There's easy instruction in the owner's mannuel, and you can search on web with instruction on video clip.
Faster Mac & Windows together without problems running too faster and running Windows Xp Pro (Autocad, 3D Punch, Powerpoint) and in the OX X 10.4.8 ( Photoshop CS2, Ilustrator, Itunes and more) really
Apple has really made a nice product with the macbook pro. i purchased mine prior to deploying to iraq. and used it in kuwait and while working at a hospital in baghdad. I use my apple to do anything from making slideshow's, video editing, gaming, etc. This is basically an all in one laptop. Not the fastest for gaming, not the most memory for music/movies storage, but those features can easily be upgraded. If this will be your first apple, NO WORRIES! The programs are very user friendly. The bluetooth is great as well as the wireless connection. One GREAT feature is the ablility to add any other Operating System (OS) to apple. However, this does not come standard. I run Windows XP and Mac OSX on my laptop. This allows me to play some computer games that are not available on mac. The superdrive can get a little loud at times, battery life isn't the greatest, but the worst thing i have found is that the laptop get extremely hot after extended use. A solution to this is purchasing a laptop fan to help with airflow. i purchased a targus chillhub for that reason (chillhub also gives 4 extra usb ports!)  This laptop has many great features to it, but still has some draw backs.
My third apple laptop. The price stays the same, but you get more and more. 160 gig drive, 2 gig ram. Still 6 lbs or so and 1 inch thick. Still weighing parallels vs. boot camp for WinXP, but I may never buy another PC.  OS 10.5 and adobe CS3 will seal the deal.
Well the ole Dell Inspiron needed to be upgraded and the MacBook Pro just had  the package that fit. Try to price another laptop with all the bells and whistles that this Mac has and see how comperable the price is!!! Then try to make it dual-boot.

I've had my MacBook Pro for almost a month now and am loving it. Watched some movies, played some games and oh yeah done some work too!

Currently running the system with BootCamp and it's like I've got two systems. Running the Mac OS obviously and Windows Vista. BootCamp currently doesn't support Vista with the driver cd-rom that is created during configuration, but you can have the drivers extracted to a folder by using '/v/a' parameters after the installer executable. Also running&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Parallels-Desktop-for-Mac-Intel-Mac/dp/B000GHIV2Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Parallels Desktop for Mac (Intel Mac)</a>&nbsp;with a Windows XP Pro, this creates a virtual machine that will run within your Mac OS boot. Parallels also allows running a BootCamp partition within the Mac envrionment; but currently does not support Vista in the way. Vista is only supported as a virtual machine. Parallels will not support this environment until BootCamp officially supports Vista.

So, if your continually working in cross platforms; this is definetly the way to go! I'm working on software development projects that support both Mac and Windows platforms and this setup has made life easier.

One oops that is not a huge deal for me and I had not thought about was; I had a small supply of mini CD-R disks for content that did not use a full size disk. The mini CD-R's don't work in the slot loading drive of the Mac.
I recently switched to mac and have not looked back.

Granted you do need some time and effort to learn apple if you are a pc user.  But that effort will be rewarded with the time that you save in the future.  The mac starts really fast (the time of loading up will be an unpleasant memory, it (almost) never freezes or brakes down and it is actually fun to use. For example,  iphoto is on of the best functions if you deal with digital photography.

The design of this notebook is stunning.  Even more stunning is its perfomance.  the best aspect is its battery that can actually give you over three hours of operation.  Of course it depens how many programs you run at the same time- but there is no comparison with a pc.

Only drawback is that not all pc programs run on it.  The choice, though of apple programs won't leave you disappointed.
Really fast while running cs2 and archicad, considering they are memory hogs. Love everything about this machine. No regrets.
This one is my third laptop form Apple in seven years and I can't be more satisfied with it.  Everything works fine, and all my old software from the PowerPC era execute without a glitch.

The only recommendation I give is upgrade your RAM to 2 GB if you want to work with Windows XP installed on a virtual machine (Parallels). I use it for two apps and it work fine.

The MacBook Pro is a super laptop. The best a ever have
I have heard all of the hype for years regarding Mac. I was not a believer. I finally broke down and made the purchase. I am pleasantly suprised to report that I absolutely love my MacBook Pro!

There is a learning curve involved as I have always used PC's however it does not take long at all to get the hang of it. I really have a great appreciatation for the Apple pre-installed programs as well such as IPhoto, Garage Band, IChat etc...

The fact that the MacBook has already taken alot of steps to pre-install many features is something I d not regret at all.

Pros - design - sleek - light weight - great looking

Screen - crisp and clear

Keypad - responsve and love the light up feature

Ease of Use and Setup - Tw Thumbs Up!!

Cons - some of my favorite PC applications don't have Mac usability yet.

-the internal speakers are good - not great - not really a con but given the excellent screen this could have been improved ever so slightly.

If you are in the market for a notebook this is the one to get!
As a dedicated PC user who's bought a lot of top end, Windows based desktops and laptops over the years I recently bought a fully spec'd 17" MacBook Pro (3 megabyte RAM) to see what the fuss was about. So what happened?

Well, right from that first start-up you're into the Mac's "it's so easy" world and, once you've installed all those pretty & clever widgets, got over the "it looks a bit too funky for me" reaction to the, actually, extremely useful docking bar, realised that installation of your applications is as simple as they claim, eventually, after much searching on the Internet, found someone kind enough to explain how you emulate the MacBook Pro's one ridiculous weakness - the missing "Delete" key (you hold down the "fn" & "backspace" keys at the same time) - and had a week of installing huge amounts of programs, coupled with a lot of messing about, without a single "crash" or "freeze" and with no obvious delays to the impressively quick start-up sequence, you're where you hoped you'd be... which is, from bitter experience, a pretty unusual experience with a new Windows PC.

But, once over the "I think I've fallen in love" phase, it's time for a more sensible evaluation of how the things work on a day-to-day basis for a Windows user. First off, the big disappointments... those staple programs of your PC either don't look too great on the Mac (Word & Excel), are difficult to emulate in Mac dedicated software (Outlook in particular), don't work on it at all (MS Publisher, Autoroute and the wonderful Digiguide), or, in the case of Adobe Photoshop & InDesign, run noticeably slower... isn't the Mac supposed to be the best thing out there for imaging & DTP? Sure, the imminent new releases of both Adobe programs are supposed to rectify this problem but hey, we're on a top end machine here with the current versions of two of the Mac's "signature" programs.

And the good news? Well, Apple's "Pages" is an incompatible but wonderfully powerful alternative to Publisher - you won't want to go back - the Mac's Utilities (hidden in the Applications folder) are simple to use and brilliantly effective, the installation of a wireless network using Airport Extreme & Express units is  remarkably straightforward, that is once you've figured out that you use the Mac (not any of the PC's connected to the network) as the machine on which the configuration settings are made, and the whole "feel" of the OSX environment inspires confidence, making you want to keep exploring new Mac applications.

But that's only the start of it... because what makes this machine so stunningly impressive for any Windows user is what it does once you install and correctly configure "Parallels", the Mac's recently released "killer" application that lets you run Windows as though it's just another Mac application. Quite simply, it converts this MacBook into the fastest, highest resolution Windows laptop I've ever used. Set the screen resolution in the Windows "window" to 1538 x 921 pixels, make sure that the Parallels Tools are installed correctly, select "Full Screen" mode and there it is... quite amazing... looks better than the any laptop you've ever seen (better than the MacBook Pro in Mac mode itself), works like a PC, lets you seamlessly transfer files between the Mac window and the PC window, and transforms your Windows versions of Word, Excel, Publisher and even Photoshop into the most beautiful experiences. And, when you get bored with your Windows programs you're only a keystroke away from watching the screen flip round to reveal your Mac.

Mac "geeks" may continue to argue that OSX is better than Windows but the truth is that Apple have produced the perfect solution... a laptop that runs OSX at its highest levels and Windows at a level that's as good as and possibly better than any dedicated PC laptop out there. Incredible.
A positively gorgeous laptop with all kinds of features built in that cost extra with PC's and are no means anywhere as cool.  Miss some of your PC stuff?  Office for MAC runs seamlessly back and forth to and from PC's with your documents and if you must, Parallels Desktop lets you run a piece of the HUGE hard drive in Windows.  This is good because it keeps Windows segregated from messing with your Mac and you can play your favorite game (mine is SolSuite) or application from your PC that you just can't give up.  Starts fast, runs faster and does everything you ask.  What are you waiting for?
I really love this notebook, the camera is nice in it. This is my first mac and the switch over from pc to mac is a good thing to do. Macs are really easy to use and the programs run much nicer on them. I will give this notebook 10 stars if i could
Here's my review... I'm a new Mac Convert

1. Design - It's Apple and well... the design it great... pretty thin compared to my old notebook (17" Dell inspiron 9300 which was a big ugly machine)

2. Performance - My old laptop was a Centrino and Core 2 Duo laptop is new to me and seriously this machine is fast... 2GB RAM helped a lot in OS X and so far all my gaming needs on Mac is greatly fulfilled (note that I do not play FPS games because I believe FPS is trash)

3. Software - What can I say... I was a Mac OS hater now lover... Just can't get enough of the stability and intuitiveness of Mac OS X compared to XP or Vista (I was using Vista for a few weeks too) and frankly speaking, Vista is a good copy of OS X but still has a lot to do.

Bundled applications - iLife 06 is great (compared to all those junk that Dell gave me)

4. Overall - I love this machine and will use it for a long time
This is the best laptop I have owned.  I switched from Windows and am very happy with my decision.  Apple's attention to detail shows in both the hardware design and OS X.
I've had my MBPC2D for a little more than a week now and I'm really loving it.  Home computer is a flat screen iMac 733 mhz/OS10.4.8 which has run great for almost 5 years, so it really was a no brainer to buy another mac (MB or MBP....i think the choice is clear).  And after I used a Dell pentium 4 laptop for a few weeks I definitely wasn't going to buy a PC.

Came loaded with the same OS as my home computer, so not too mant differences in that regards, though Photo Booth is fun.  Other than Safari unexpectedly crashing a few times (?), I really like the operating system and it handles the thousands of photos I already have in iPhoto so much faster than my desktop.  Speed wise it blows my old computer away, especially at start up, starting programs, etc.  Not sure how it compares to any comparably priced PCs (I guess that'd kinda be a high end model), but I feel like the ease of interface and keyboard shortcuts lessen operator time, regardless of processor speed.  I couldn't believe how fast I transferred multiple Gigs from an external hard drive via the firewire 400 port.

This is my first laptop, and it is taking me a little while to adjust to the keyboard and mouse, but they feel solid (as does the computer in general).  I'll probably get the wireless micromouse, but I'm going to give it a few weeks first.

Biggest complaints are the fact that the screen doesnt open 180 degrees so that it lies flat (in fact i feel like it barely opens far enough when the computer is setting lower than ideal; also the speakers are not very impressive; and why does apple seem to gloat over not providing a decent manual?  Occassionally seems like the trackpad isn't responding or I jump somewhere unexpectedly, but I really think that is mostly me adjusting to a laptop.

I got the matte screen (no choice offered in Amazon) and I have no complaints about its appearance.  I really was unsure after reading various reviews online.  It did take a while to get the screen brightness/energy saver/backlighting all synced, but since the I have used the computer in a variety of lighting conditions both inside and out with no problems with visibility or glare.

It was really ease to set up my home network, utilizing a motorola wireless cable modem and tieing together my imac, printer, OWC hard drive and the new laptop.  I really had no idea what I was doing going into it, but it only took a few hours to get an encrypted network up and running.  At work the computers are all PCs, mostly using MS office, and I was able to immediately connect.  It was hot.  I'm using the computer for both home and work, so it's going to get a real workout, physically if not processorwize.

Final word is I really dig my MBP, I really dread someone snagging it, and I don't understand why people continue to buy so many PCs.  This was the most computer I could afford and I'm pretty sure it will still be a good computer 5 years from now.  I'll probably skip 10.5, upgrade when 10.6 comes out.  Unfortunately I won't need a new Mac till 2012....
Wow, what a machine.  I can't say enough about it. I was a Mac user back in the fat Mac days, but had to switch to PCs for work.  After 12 years using windows, I finally came back home.  Like the prodigal son, I am returning with awe and wonder.  Thanks for the great machine.  I especially like the fact that the operating system is so stable.  I was always troubleshooting my internet security and virus protection programs.  Lots of conflicts with windows and none here.  The MacBook Pro keyboard is solid to touch and the speakers sound great by themselves. THe screen size is great and resolution is good.  I especially like being able to have the computer on at nite and not having to have a light on.  The keyboard is backlite, so no problems typing in the dark.  I have had about 3 portables before this one, so I'm not new to portable computers.  I highly recommend the MacBook Pro... for those who want the best and are willing to pay a little more for it.  Its worth the extra dollars!
I love this computer. I've used pcs for years and decided to switch to the mac because of the graphic and display capabilities. The macbook pro is a very elegant machine. I loaded microsoft windows xp on the machine using boot camp, and comparing the process of installation and set for the two systems: mac osx and windows, the mac system blows windows out of the water.

This is a wonderful computer and if you are considering switching to the mac from a pc, do it.

I did a lot of research and yes I did encounter some glitches in installation process and linking all my existing hardware to the mac, but in the end, I always found what I needed online via the numerous forums online.
I purchased this to replace a 5-year old Ti PowerBook which died after 5 years of dedicated service. I have never had any major problems with the computer. Not to say that I never had any problems; I just didn't have any problems that I couldn't correct or fix. I am not going to debate which OS is better - Mac or Windows. There is enought debate between the 2 sides with each one claimng their preference is better. What I know is this - Mac OS X works for me.  I prefer its elegance and simplicity. There is nothing that I need that isn't available on the Mac. And I am extremely satisfied with this new MacBook Pro. It is extremely fast compared to my previous PowerBook. I like the updates to the various Apple software products. My previous OS X was Jaguar and I like Tiger tremendously. Especially the 'Widgets'. The screen is beautiful. I don't see any 'graininess' that I have read about on various forums. I like the DVD burner. I like everything about it! No complains. I would recommend this to anyone.
I got my Core 2 Duo Macbook pro just two weeks after they were announced and have never had a single complaint. It's a beautiful machine, blazingly fast, not a single crash etc etc etc. To demonstrate to some friends just how powerful it is, I went to the applications folder hit command-a for select all then command-o for open. There was about a ten second pause, and then they all just opened up. Every single app.

Here's another fun example. I was helping a friend with his digital photos. I loaded them up in iPhoto and started sorting them. Some of them were just horrible. You could see glowing red eyes and an overhead light, everything else was black. Two seconds later you could see that it was a man playing ping pong, two friends standing by the window with beer cups in hand, and that the carpet was green. This got gasps of amazement. The DVD I made for him got some "Wow"'s too. Amasing machine, amazing software.
My old iBook was short on hard disk space and in need of major repairs, so I figured upgrading would be money better spent. But for all the hype, the MacBook is, in many ways, a step backwards. Sure, it's got a fast processor, but my old versions of Adobe Creative Suite crawl because they're not optimized, and Microsoft Office is just a slug. Many of my programs won't even run at all on the new Intel chip. The battery life, meanwhile, is simply pathetic by iBook standards- 2.5-3 hours versus 4.5-5 for the old iBook- making an extra battery a must if you plan on using your computer on flights. And for some reason, it frequently fails to enter sleep mode properly, so I often open up my computer to find that it's burned most of the little battery life it has. I've had a lot of Mac laptops and the MacBook Pro isn't an awful computer, but it's hardly Apple's best effort, either.

Overall, I'd say that if you're happy with your current setup, just stick with it until more software is ready for the Intel chip and Apple has figured out how to make this beast more efficient.
Works great, doesn't get hot like the older version, I didn't see more than 65 degrees celcius, but it is more like 45 degrees all the time (except you are using that nifty PowerPC applications)..

Windows XP works very fast under Parallels also.. Thanks to Apple again for this products, as a web designer I could also look at Windows and Apple at the same time for browser bugs..

It is not that much expensive for this product anymore, comparing with PC's with same spec's..
This laptop is Crazy fast. And OSX is just amazing. One less vista sale hear
I have had my 17" Macbook Pro for a while now and have had time to get to know it. I have kept track of all the things I like and dislike about it.

I like that it:

Runs quietly, has a back lit keyboard that is smooth and easy to use, has good battery life, solid construction, has excellent screen resolution, plus many little things that make it nice to use.

Now, for what I don't like. I have made a list. I hope apple reads it and does something about the problems. Here we go...

Hardware

-The button to open the lid is hard to push if you have big thumbs.

-There is not enough friction in the screen hinges to prevent it from flopping forward when you tilt the computer.

-You get thumb prints on the camera every time you open the lid.

-Sometimes it will only eject a cd/dvd an inch making it hard to get out.

-The screen has noticeable bright spots when viewing solid colors.

-The power cord comes out too easily.

-The screen flickers on its brightest setting.

-The screen doesn't go back far enough to get a good viewing angle when sitting on the floor.

-The edges of the screen flair up when its closed.

-The space bar squeaks occasionally.

Software

-OSX fails spontaneously, just like Windows.

-A lot of the software it comes with is useless and takes up a huge amount of space.

-The performance has gone downhill since I bought it.

-The volume doesn't stay constant. It seems to randomly adjust itself while you're not listening to anything.

-There is no way of controlling what it does when you close the screen. It's supposed to sleep, but sometimes it stays on for no good reason.

-There aren't enough dock controls (you can't turn off the annoying bouncing alert).

-Sometimes the screen goes blue for a few seconds after waking up.

-I have the screen brightness set to "Never Dim", but it still does.

-The track pad doesn't keep scrolling when you get to its edge.

-You can't disable the annoying 1980's start up sound.

-It takes way too long to rename files.

-The logic of the highlighting text needs improvement.

-There is a lot of noise in the audio jack.

-The key-repeat isn't fast enough.

-It won't remember the finder's view settings for a second.

-Programs spontaneously stall and/or quit.

That's all. Picky? I don't think so considering the price tag. However, knowing what I do now, I would still buy it. Not because it is a good computer (it's far from perfect) but because it is the best one I have ever used.
This notebook is extremely great. This is the first Mac I have owned, but have been using them for quite some time since I'm a graphic design student. This notebook clearly shines even over the PowerMac G5's in my university's labs. With 2GB RAM, a 2.33GHz processor and a 120GB hard-drive, I'm well set for quite a few years to come.

Anyways, onto the review.

Screen: The screen is great! Nice and bright and I love having the widescreen with 1440x900 resolution. I can really fit alot of things on the screen nicely. Also, with the DVI port on the side of the laptop, I could connect my 19" Dell UltraSharp monitor, and now I have dual-screens. You simply plug in the included DVI to VGA adaptor and configure settings for each monitor. From here, you can drag things right off the MacBook Pro's screen right over to your 2nd monitor. I've seen alot of bad reviews for the included adaptor...however mine works perfectly fine and have never had a problem. Users with problems may have a cruddy monitor or are just doing something wrong.

Speed: This notebook is QUICK. I've seen alot of horrid reviews when using software such as Photoshop, Illustrator, Flash, etc. I use all of the Adobe software CONSTANTLY, and I haven't had many problems that can't be solved with simply saving more often. Every once in awhile Photoshop or Illustrator might crash depending on what I'm doing...but it is rare. Once CS3 comes out, there won't be ANY problems what-so-ever. Every day I work having Photoshop, Illustrator, Flash, iTunes, Safari and iChat opened, and it hardly ever makes the computer struggle to support all of this load. My last computer was a SONY VIAO with 1GB Ram and a 2.8GHz processor. It would have never been able to handle this high of a workload, but the MacBook Pro succeeds.

Appearance: This thing is slick. The nice aluminum case looks very sophisticated and is constructed very smoothly. I purchased a Speck clear-plastic clip on case to prevent scratching to the aluminum since once its scratched, theres no fixing it. Anyways, The keyboard is very nice, the keys feel excellent when typing. I really like having the 2-finger support of the touch pad when I don't have a mouse handy. The backlit keyboard is also very nice for working in the dark or with low-lighting. You simply choose how bright/dim you want the keys to be with F9 and F10. The Super Drive located in the front of the notebook is more convenient than slide-out units on the side. Also, having the Apple Remote to activate front row with the sensor on the front of the laptop is great....simply sit on the couch with the remote and you can go through your iTunes music, movies, dvds,etc. The speakers in the notebook sound very impressive for most notebooks. Very clear, crisp sounds.

Complaints: One complaint I have is the heat. This thing does get pretty toasty sometimes under heavy workloads causing the fans to kick in. However, I downloaded SMC FanControl and set the fans to 3500rpm, so the fans consistently keep the CPU cool...around 116 degrees fahrenheit. Without this, fans will jump up to around 6000rpm when the CPU reaches 125 degrees fahrenheit.

Another gripe I have is that sometimes when in sleep mode, the computer doesn't know what to do. Its rare, but it still happens. When I try to wake up the computer, it takes a few tries till it will bring up the window to let me log back in. Sometimes it'll even shut-off or restart when in sleep. Very odd. Once again, SAVE SAVE SAVE your work.

Overall I'm very happy with this purchase...but then again for 2500.00 I'd better be. I ordered directly from Apple to take advantage of the $200 college discount.
I've been a computer user/programmer for nearly 30 years, using a variety of hardware, but mostly Mac for the past 20 years.  The company I owned until recently ran both Macs and PCs.  I just purchased the 2.33 Ghz MacBook Pro, and I couldn't be happier.  The hardware is spectacular and, of course, OS X is rock solid and intuitive--head and shoulders ahead of any other OS on the market.  Plus, the iLife software is a joy to use.  Everything just works and works together.  If you're in the market for the best notebook computer in the world today, look no further than this baby!
Having owned other Mac computers, when it came time to upgrade to a modern machine that could handle 3D modeling (my 6 yr. old iBook was having a hard time with it), I was loath to buy a PC.  My wife, on the other hand, having only used Windows, and being skeptical by nature and not seeing any compelling reason to adjust to a new fangled and seemingly marginal computer, strongly felt we should go with a PC and not try to be special, etc...  I had a hard time explaining why I preferred the Mac, because on paper there is not much difference.  Nonetheless, I knew in a profound way that, in the comfort of my own home, there was no way I was going to be using a Dell running Windows.  The thought of that scenario just sucked the fun right out of anything I thought of doing with the computer...

To make a long story short, I simply refused to buy a PC and my wife ultimately gave in (arguments omitted; and bless her!).  It took a couple weeks, but after using it for a while, she has no complaints.  In fact, she now says she "loves" the computer.  At first, I thought she was being sarcastic with this unexpected comment, but I  pressed her and she really means it.  I asked her if she could go back and buy a PC now, and I was not a factor in the decision, would she?  She would not!  She feels that the Mac is in fact fun to use and she has been impressed with the included software. (the fantastic build quality and tasteful form factor doesn't hurt either...).

Bottom line, there is now contentment in our home with this purchase. The computer is fast, efficient, and unobtrusive.  Besides that, it is just a really, really nice computer...  the little details like the illuminated keyboard, the automatic brightness adjustments of the screen, the tight integration of the software, the aluminum chassis, the balanced feel it has when it sits in your lap, the proportions... It is very well done.
The screen is crap. I have had to replace it twice, not a problem since it is under warranty, but when the warranty runs out, I will have to spend around $500 for when the screen starts to go dim on one side again. I have been a Mac user my whole life, but I really feel screwed over by this product. I am a professional Web and Graphic Designer and EVERY SINGLE PROGRAM I RUN IS SLOW (because the programs have to be translated by Rosetta) This just shows how careless Apple really is. If the Mac Book Pro were to be released June 2007, it would be released around the same time as Adobe CS2 which will be switched over to universal binary allowing to really capture how power the machine can be. However, that is months away and you will have to put up with EXTREMELY SLOW graphics programs until then. Mac always has run Graphics programs a little slower than PC, but not THIS much slower. You like lynksys routers? Forget them, a lot of people (including myself) have been having problems with the connection between the Mac Book Pro and the lynksys router. These problems cause the internet connection to constantly be dropped. I contacted apple support about the problem and they linked me to a troubleshooting page stating the following steps:

1) Reset Router

2) If Number 1 does not work, contact 3rd party router support.

 I guess I will have to go out and buy the Mac Express Airport, which has all the same features as any other wireless router at twice the price. Another big problem with the router is that sometimes I have trouble even shutting it down; I will have to do a "force quit" on finder just so it will shut off. Another problem is that sometimes the laptop will turn itself on while closed, this isn't normally a problem with most laptops, but the Mac Book Pro runs EXTREMELY hot, and with that heat pressed directly against the screen, it can cause little gray spots on the screen. SO DON'T FORGET TO TURN YOUR MAC BOOK PROS OFF EVERYTIME YOU WANT TO CARRY THEM SOMEWHERE. This is ridiculous, I used to love this company, but ever since the Ipod has come out, they just don't seem to care about their computers. My company is running Windows Vista on all non-design platforms, and you know what, its good, its REALLY good. Mac has lost themselves a customer, I am no longer impressed with Mac OS X which I feel is sluggish at best, it has problems reading advanced and sometimes even basic coding (this is something Macs have always struggled with [hence why most web designers use PCs ]) .

The insight camera is really cool and so is the video chat ability, but very few people have the ability to do this video chat back, plus, it is usually very choppy.

As I said, I have been a Mac user since the 80s, but I am not biased. If you are going to shell out $2500 on a laptop, you deserve something of quality; the Mac Book Pro is not it.
It's thin, light weight and very fast. Plus it runs windows (if you must)
I usually never do these reviews, but I love my MacBook Pro so much that I thought I should.  While my previous computer was an iMac G5, this is my fist portable mac.  I have had it for 2 weeks now and it is my new best friend.  The body of this thing is something that will turn heads.  From the beautiful aluminum casing, to the glowing apple, this thing looks great.

My MacBook Pro runs extremely cool.  I have 0 complaints regarding the heat.  My old Dell 600m got warmer than this.  As for the fan noise, it is non-existent.  I take my notebook to class and I can't hear it running when the room is silent.  This is hands down, the best computer I have ever owned, laptop or desktop.
Pros

Applications run faster than previous PowerBook or MacBook Pro

MagSafe

Built-in iSight

Improved Trackpad

Front Row

Runs cooler than previous MacBook Pro, yet quiet

Beautiful screen, easy on the eyes

Still the same (or similar) size and weight

2GB RAM standard

Cons

Relatively speaking, not as portable

I upgraded to the Core 2 Duo MacBook Pro (MBP) recently after deciding to upgrade from a 1.67GHz PowerBook, which I used for Aperture, web surfing, and all-around general computing.

And what a difference an extra 0.66MHz and an additional processor core makes! In my subjective experience, applications such as Aperture run much, much faster, making it more enjoyable to use. It lets me focus at the work at hand rather than twiddle my thumbs waiting for the application to finish its processes. The new Macs all run on Intel processors, which means that if your applications are categorized as Universal Binary, which means it can run natively on Intel or PowerPC processors. they will run "natively." I have Microsoft Office which is not a universal binary, but Rosetta (which allows non-universal apps to run) does a pretty good job. The startup is slow, but once the application is started, everything else seems to run fine.

I really like the MagSafe power connector. It connects to the notebook via a magnetic connection, unlike the PowerBook's traditional "plug" connector. The advantage is that when someone trips or snags the power cord, the MacBook Pro's MagSafe connector just snaps off without dragging the rest of the notebook off the table or your lap. It also saves the connector from getting damaged, which on my PowerBook, did happen when I tripped over the cord (clumsy me).

Compared to the PowerBook, the MBP seems to run cooler. At least my lap doesn't get too uncomfortable running extended sessions of Aperture. The keyboard remains pretty cool to touch, too. Generally, I think Apple improved on the cooling/ventilation of the MBP over the PowerBooks. I was also able to compare my MBP with a previous generation MBP (2.16GHz Core Duo, with 2GB RAM) and the difference I could feel on my lap is very noticeable as well. As with the PowerBook, my MBP seems to run pretty quiet.

The screen resolution, at 1680x1050,  over my PowerBook is higher, which as 1440x900. The keyboard controls remain exactly the same, with brightness, volume, and keyboard illumination. The keys themselves feel the same, which is a good thing because I really liked typing on the PowerBook. The trackpad has been improved over the PowerBook. It's bigger, and it allows easy substitution for right-clicks. On my PowerBook, right-click meant Control-click. On the MBP, right-click means placing two fingers on the trackpad and clicking. It's far easier and simpler. And I think it's better than having two physical buttons.

The MBP comes with a built-in camera called iSight. There's a little camera on the bezel of the display, and a green indicator lights up when the camera is in operation, with applications such as iChat or Photo Booth. The camera works well for video conferencing in iChat (camera is also compatible with Skype) and spending hours with Photo Booth. My MBP also came with a small remote control that operates Front Row, which is like a media center for your Mac. The remote is a 6-way remote and it's simple to operate Front Row. I can place my MBP on the table and sit back to enjoy a DVD or some of the movies and TV shows I purchased from iTunes, or listen to my music collection. The only drawback with a simple remote is that if you're deep inside many layers of menus, you have to press 'menu" many times to get back to the top level.

Physically, the MBP is the same size as my PowerBook, or at least it appears to be. I didn't take long to get accustomed to it. Like I mentioned, the keyboard layout is the same, and getting accustomed to the trackpad took just a few moments. I'm glad that Apple has finally gotten enough sense to make 2GB RAM as standard. My PowerBook had 512MB as standard. The MBP is able to accommodate up to 3GB.

Even though it's only 1-inch thick and weighs less than 7 pounds, it's nevertheless a big notebook. If your priority is portability, then a 15-inch MBP or a MacBook can be a better alternative. I chose this model for the screen size and resolution. It's a bit of a hassle when traveling, but the benefits of having a near full-fledged notebook outweighs the small inconvenience.

The MBP is a lot of computer. It appears to be expensive, but if you add up the features, the attention to details that's apparent starting from the packaging (the box is like a quarter of the size of my PowerBook packaging), the built-in software, and ease of use, the price is well worth it. There aren't many (or none at all) 17-inch Windows-based notebooks of the size and weight of the MBP. The feel of the notebook, the keyboard, the trackpad, and how it feels on my fingers, to the elegance of OS X and Mac applications, wins me over time and time again over its rivals.
I just buy a 15', very cool and no noise, no problems in other reviews.

I show it to roomates, one of them just ask if only apple has screen that can show movie with this pleasureful color.

The performance is very good, no problem on mulit-task.
I am thrilled with my new MacBook - so far no problems at all.
Overall, this notebook is the best you can find out there in it's class. You may get better Graphics or storage with Alienware or other brands for the price but you will have to sacrifice size and weight which is the most important factor of a notebook/laptop...the portability. Other notebooks in this class are almost twice the thickness and are way more heavier. I would recommend this notebook for everyone.

Best of all, it's a Mac!...NO more anti-virus programs, NO more spy ware cleaners, NO more firewalls which you need to watch over like if you are the firewall and no optimization utilities for the OS to work.
I was concerned mainly about noise and heat but my new MacBook Pro was perfect.  The earlier problems have been solved.  I am very happy with this purchase.
I used a Mac a few years ago (Powerbook 3400), but I've mostly used PCs, crawling along with the various flavors of Windows.  I decided it was time to upgrade, and decided to switch to a Mac.  This 17" MacBook Pro is such a refreshing change... both on the software and hardware fronts.

The hardware is nicely designed.  Screen is nice & sharp, the aluminum chassis is quite striking, and the whole design is just classy & clean.  It has some nice Apple touches, such as the mag-safe power plug (which works very well), display latches that hide away when the screen is open, and a keyboard that glows when the ambient light is low.  Performance-wise, this laptop is quite peppy with everything I've thrown at it so far.

Software-wise, I really like OS X.  Everything just works--and works quickly and smoothly.  In contrast, I still have a PC desktop (both at home & at work), and I just get tired at how slowly things can run at times, and the error messages that pop up regularly.  Even so, I just finished installing Windows XP MCE using Apple's boot camp, mostly just because I'm a big Flight Simulator fan.  It runs really well on this Macbook, even at the highest levels of detail, no doubt due to the robust CPU, large amount of memory, and powerful graphics processor.  All the built-in applications that Apple includes (iLife '06) are really nice, I'm still just scratching the surface on all they have to offer.

You'll be hard-pressed to find a better laptop package -- PC or Mac.
I really love my MacBook Pro - I got it in May as a graduation gift to take to college. I have enjoyed using it a TON and it is more practical than ever for college kids to get a mac. A lot of my friend's parents have had questions regarding them, and many of my friends wouldn't get one due to their perceived incompatibility with windows, but now with Parallels and Boot Camp that is a nonissue.

Macs are better than ever for college use in large part due to the prevalence of viruses - with the number of users on college network and the number of viruses processed daily, OS X's immunity to viruses is a real godsend.

Apple has really stepped it up with the iLife suite and the programs are more phenomenal than ever. It is so easy to make a movie in iMovie, burn it to DVD with iDVD and all that goes along with it. For my graduation party, I made a slideshow of pictures of me growing up in iPhoto, complete with soundtrack. It was the hit of the party and (not counting the time it took to scan in photos) it took about 5 minutes to get right and then about 15 to burn to DVD.

The problems I have had with this machine are few, but having been a mac user for about 5 years now, I can say that the Macs on Intel chips do not seem nearly as stable as my old PowerPC macs. I experience a lot more random quits with the programs. Granted, the adobe program's frequent quits are easily explained, as those are not yet Universal applications. But my problem is with those programs that are supposedly universal - the iLife suite and Safari browser frequently quit during normal use, and this did not happen nearly as often on the PowerPC macs. Surprisingly, Microsoft Office is pretty stable - it is not yet universal, but I would say that it is far more stable than say, Safari.

Overall, I really love my mac and I would not trade it for any other computer out there!!!
Since I am a Macintosh devotee, I am enthralled with this product. This is an upgrade from my smaller, slower, less expensive PowerBook. It's everything it's advertised to be. Every day I discover more of it's capabilities. It is a handsome, efficient quality product that I am proud to own.
I have had my macbook pro for a little over a day now and I must say that even with my highly picky standards, I'm satisfied with the product in every way, shape and form. I love the glossy screen, the built-in isight, Mac OS X, the sleek design, Apple's customer service, everything. I had doubts that I may have a hard time switching to a mac because this is my first mac ever after about 10 years of PC use, but after 5 minutes, I was ready to go and now I have no difficulty using my mac. The fan is barely noticeable even if you really intently listen for it, and there is absolutely no heat problem. The fan is nonexistent and my macbook pro runs cooler than my acer, and the warmness feels good on my lap, all while beating my old acer's performance. Apple's build quality is amazing. I don't miss the right click at all, and the magsafe power cord is just really cool. Everything about this product is just great. Never shut down, the wireless network was set up in 10 seconds without any of my effort, and recognized every peripheral I threw at it. And at 5.5lbs, the macbook pro is very portable.

About Apple's customer service, I was rarely on hold for more than 3 minutes at a time, and it took longer to write this review than the time it took for the 4 calls combined. They just get stuff done.

I rarely ever give 5-star ratings, but I would gladly give my macbook pro a 5-star rating or even higher.  Windows, NEVER AGAIN.
I usually don't do reviews on products but this is worth it. Just opening up the box and looking at this machine you can tell right away the design blows away the competition. Its not cheeseburger thich and clunky like all the other pc vendors out there. Then there is a lot of little things Apple does. Take for instance the built in camera that is of decent quality or the ambient censored light behind the keyboard. As far as the operating system goes, who wouldnt like a operating system that doesnt crash and get virus's. Its nice that I don't have to run all those apps on my Macbook Pro. No spyware or antivirus here!  Plus you can run WINDOWS! Full speed no emulation. One machine that can do everything!
The MacBook Pro 17 Core 2 Duo is a nice little machine. Were it a PC, I'd give it five stars on most every count. Unfortuantely, I'm coming from a Powerbook 17 which was a perfect machine, speed aside, and so I hold it to this standard.

Firstly, the display is not as nice as the Powerbook's. The brightness is not at all uniform between the center and edges of the screen. It looks very much like a mid-range conventional PC notebook in this regard.

Secondly, when running CPU-intensive tasks, the machine is far louder than the Powerbook. The fan gets to sound about like a PC desktop, but higher-pitched. The Powerbook 17 was probably about half as loud at full speed. It's definitely enough that you don't want it in the same room if you're doing any kind of recording work.

Next, the boot and hibernation times are longer than the Powerbook. I know I've seen videos showing the MacBook Pro starting up more quickly than the Powerbook, however with the same software installed on both there's a definite longer period. It's just enough that I find I don't casually flip it shut anymore.

Lastly, while your results may vary, mine died within three weeks and is now out for service. The airport became increasingly less responsive at first, and then the whole machine started locking hard at irregular intervals -- not a spinning beachball, but a full hard lock where everything freezes and a power cycle is needed. It continued doing this even during a software reinstall, and Apple tells me that it will take about two weeks for me to get it fixed or replaced. In retrospect, I wish I'd waited to see that this iteration was solid before buying.

All this aside, the machine does pack a bigger punch than the Powerbook 17 when working. Applications are considerably smoother, games run well, and I end up doing some tasks twice because they complete so quickly that I think I messed up a command or menu option! The huge hard drive is great for so small a machine, and it turns heads in public every bit as much as the beautiful Powerbook 17 did. Further, being able to run Windows apps via Parallels (and soon VMWare!) is useful on occasion, though it's funny how little one has to do that these days.
Before you purchase this notebook online, you really owe it to yourself to walk into the nearest AppleCentre to see if you can tolerate the LCD panels used on this system. In contrast to the 17" model of the Macbook Pro, the Macbook, as well as numerous PC laptops, the 15" Macbook Pro comes with a LCD panel that exhibits very visible "grain". This "grain" is especially visible on solid colours and when viewing photos. Both the 15" and 17" Macbook Pros have also been found to come with LCD panels that are only capable of displaying 6 bits of colour (certainly not in the "millions").

If you are happy with spending $2.5 grand on a laptop with a display that is par for a $900 Dell, this laptop is meant for you, but if you do need a good display for your work, you would be better served switching back to Windows and buying a PC laptop instead.

Without question, the MacBook Pro Core 2 Duo is the best computer I've ever used. This is the best thing I can say about ANY computer: it just finds a way to do what you need it to do. Got a PC file you need to open in OS X? No problem. Want to run streaming video that's built specifically for PC's? Here's a bridge you can download. Need to run Windows -- and all of your Windows applications -- natively? Now you can.

Having said that, I should also state that I ran away from Mac for years because I felt jilted by their claims (ultimately false) that you could run both Mac applications and PC applications on a PowerPC. The PowerPC environment was an artificial environment, unstable, clunky, slow, frustrating.

This MacBook Pro is a quantum leap in computing. It's the perfect combination of software (OS X) hardware and out-of-the-box usability. Until I purchased my MBP C2D, I hadn't found a computer yet that could keep up with me. I have a job where I need to keep multiple applications open simultaneously for long periods of time, switching between them frequently and importing and exporting large files.

I do have three complaints. First, the keyboard is a little awkward. I thought it might be because of my large male hands, but my girlfriend dislikes the keyboard even more than I do. This is a minor issue that I can live with. Second, I wish it had a couple of extra USB ports, but I've gone totally wireless, so even that's not a major issue. Third, the speakers pretty much suck. Don't plan to get any great sound quality out of your tunes unless you wirelessly link to your home stereo.

Finally, Apple has made computing fun again. From widgets to intuitive wi-fi to all of the FREE software applications you can download to extend your computer's functionality (and have a lot of fun), the MacBook Pro will have you enjoying your work again.
I'm a Microsoft Certified Software Developer by trade, and have been a die hard PC zealot for a long time.  Once Apple made the move to the Intel architecture and Boot Camp was released, I made the decision to give Apple and OS X a try.  I'm now a Mac convert.

The system is, hands down, the best system I've ever owned.  Its speed is nearly unmatched.  It's extremely responsive.  The quickness with which it goes to/resumes from sleep is amazing (about 3 seconds from lid open to completely usable).  In this configuration with 2GB ram and the 2.33GHZ C2D, the system rarely if ever suffers from slowdown, no matter what I'm doing with it.

The aesthetics are a whole other story.  Everything about the system screams quality and class.  It looks beautiful, it behaves beautifully, and  Apple's Mac OSX is hands down the most elegant and useful operating system I've ever used.

With Boot Camp from Apple, Windows XP installs and runs effortlessly.  Even though I've installed Windows XP SP2 and Visual Studio, I find myself booting into Windows less and less.

Coming from a recent Mac convert, if you haven't given a mac a try, this is the machine to buy.  Especially since you can install Windows XP (and vista, in the future), you can still run your Windows Applications if need be.  There's no excuse not to try it.  You will not regret the decision.
The Apple MacBook Pro with 2.33GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processor, 17-inch TFT widescreen display (1680 by 1050 pixels), 2GB DDR2 SDRAM, 160GB 5400-rpm hard drive and SuperDrive is almost everything one could ask for in 15.4 by 10.4 by 1.0 inches package. Yes, the MacBook Pro (MBP) truly is one-inch-thick and weighs in at 6.8 pounds. The requisite USB 2.0; FireWire 400; FireWire 800; Ethernet; optical digital audio in and out; headphone ports are available. An iSight camera integrated into the top of the display can capture video and still images. Airport Extreme (802.11g) wireless networking and Bluetooth are standard. Listing all the features of the MBP would be exhaustive. If you need the MBP's complete feature list and capabilities, visit the 'Hardware' section of Apple's Web site.

The MBP comes sandwiched in between two thin layers of Styrofoam, all enclosed in a svelte square black box with a plastic carrying handle. Apple has a minimalist approach to packaging and documentation. Included in the MBP box are the AC plug, AC power cord, MagSafe power adapter, DVI to VGA adapter and Apple remote. Documentation consists of a small 78-pages booklet entitled, "Everything Mac." Two Mac OS X Install Discs, warranties and two white Apple stickers are enclosed in another packaged entitled, "Everything else."

Apple's Setup Assistant prompts you for your personal information when the MBP is powered on for the first time. The Setup Assistant also guides you through the transfer of information from another Mac - such as users, applications, network and machine settings, files and volumes. I did not use the Setup Assistant to transfer my PowerBook's files to the new MBP. Instead, I later chose to activate Personal File Sharing, and transfer the files I needed over my Airport network. Both methods are relatively straightforward, though, the Setup Assistant is easier. Migration Assistant, which is stored in the Macintosh HD/Applications/Utilities folder, can be run at any time to do the same tasks as Setup Assistant.

Let's dispense with the technical details and get to what the MBP can do - almost everything. The MBP can run both PowerPC (PPC) and native Intel-based applications. Rosetta runs PPC applications transparently. The major difference between Rosetta PPC and native Intel applications is speed. Native Intel applications will run faster. However, the MBP is fast; even Rosetta applications are very responsive. Mac OS X on Intel MBPs does not support Classic applications. If you need to run Classic applications on your Intel MBP, as a last resort, you can search Google for an application named SheepShaver. Applications that are labeled as universal binaries will run natively on both Intel and PPC Macs.

The 17-inch display is wonderful. You will need to decide if you want a matte or glossy display. I chose a matte display, but the choice is yours. The MacRumors forums have good discussions about the matte versus glossy MBP display. Briefly, those who want fewer reflections and colors that are more accurate choose matte; those who want brighter and more saturated colors choose glossy. If you cannot decide, go to an Apple Store or Mac reseller and compare the matte and glossy MBP displays yourself. The display does not open past 135 degrees. At first, this appeared to be an issue, but thanks to the brightness and resolution of the display I have never needed to open the display past the 135 degrees limit.

The MagSafe power adapter uses a magnet to connect to the MBP. If someone trips over the cord or exerts any other undue force on the power adapter cord, the MagSafe adapter will disconnect from the MBP - saving your MBP from crashing to the ground. To protect my MBP from scratches dents or worse, I purchased an aluminum Matias Laptop Armor case because I do not believe the soft-sided cases will offer enough protection. The MBP may be fast, but it is also delicate. You may also want to consider purchasing the AppleCare extended warranty to extend Apple's 90 days telephone technical support/1 year parts and labor service to 3 years telephone technical support/parts and labor service. If you search eBay, you can purchase AppleCare at almost 50% off the retail price. AppleCare does not cover either accidental or cosmetic damage; therefore, due diligence and a good case are necessary.

Does the Intel MBP run Windows? Of course it does! The MBP can run Windows via virtualization or Apple's Boot Camp. If you choose Apple's Boot Camp (a free public beta download), you can boot your Intel MBP to run either Mac OS X or Windows XP. Windows XP will run natively on the Intel processor and on a separate hard disk partition with Boot Camp. If you choose to run Windows through virtualization, you can install XP or Vista; as well as other operating systems. The most developed Mac virtualization software as of this writing is Parallels Desktop for Mac. (VMware Fusion is currently undergoing private beta testing. Search Google if you must try VMware's Fusion.) Installing Windows with Parallels is relatively straightforward on the MBP, but expect to muck around a bit before all is perfect.

The one thing the Intel MBP Core 2 Duo cannot do is either read or write Blu-ray/HD DVD discs. The MacRumors forums suggest a possible Blu-ray drive in the upcoming 'Santa Rosa' MBP, but this is speculation. Having said that, the MBP's SuperDrive is great; it can write CD-R, CD-RW, DVD-R, DVD-RW, DVD+R, DVD+RW and DVD+R DL. Of course, the quality of a burned CD or DVD is only as good as the media used - check the AfterDawn forums for media recommendations.

Although you will be able to upgrade the MBP's memory to the 3GB maximum by swapping one of two 1GB memory modules for a 2GB module, Apple does not allow you to upgrade the hard drive yourself. This is a shame since 160GB fill up at a very fast rate with a computer this powerful. Nevertheless, the 5400-rpm hard drive is very responsive. As always, remember to backup often - search Google for 'Dr. Mac's Guide to Backing Up Your Mac' for more information.

Do not expect to get much use out of most the trial software included with the MBP, the trial status severely limits usability. However, BitTorrent (peer-assisted digital content delivery platform) users can rest easy as the MBP works well with the popular Mac BitTorrent clients Azureus and Transmission. I can easily get 100 kB/s uploads and downloads over my Airport network connected to a cable modem. (I believe more people should look into BitTorrent, there are downloads for every taste available; just remember to seed after downloading.) The Apple Airport Extreme and Express base stations integrate fabulously with Mac OS X and the MBP to create wireless networks. If you buy AppleCare for your MBP, the Airport base station that you use with your MBP is also covered.

Obviously, I am a Mac evangelist, but there really is no reason not to buy a MBP. I am glad I chose the 17" MBP over the 15" model for the extra screen real estate. Working with many applications at a time is a breeze on the 17" screen. Yes, the MBP is pricey, but you are getting a lot of computer (in a slim package) with the MBP. Moreover, if you use PriceGrabber to price the MBP, you can rest assured of a good deal. If nothing else, if you purchase a 17" MBP Core 2 Duo, you will be able to see your PC-using friends turn green with envy when they spot your MBP. I hope this helps.

All the Best.
I had purchased a Core Duo MBP just 9 days before Apple announced the Core 2 Duo line, so I returned my original and swapped out for a new one. The new MBP--or at least the unit I bought--seems to have fixed many quality control issues and improved upon the last one's features. For example, whereas my old MBP ran EXTREMELY hot (a common complaint about that model), the new C2D product runs cooler than almost any other laptop I've ever used. The old one's lid didn't close flush on both sides (noticeable gap on the left side), whereas this one does. Excessive fan noise had been a problem; this one is extremely quiet. The infamous MBP "screen hum" had afflicted my Core Duo model, whereas it's never present on this one, no matter what the screen's brightness is set to. As for a few complaints I've read about inconsistent backlighting on the LCD on both models, I never had that problem on either one. The LCD is extremely bright and provides an excellent display. It's less than perfect because contrast falls off too quickly with only minor changes in viewing angle (matte screen), but a minor gripe.

Simply put, I think Apple got it right on this second rev, in terms of build quality etc. By far the nicest laptop I've ever owned.
Perhaps it's premature to rate a product after only a weekend of using it, but so far my 2.33 GHz Core 2 Duo MacBook Pro shines.

I bought this laptop to replace my old Windows XP desktop.  The first thing I did when I got this laptop is re-installed OS X.  This may sound like a strange thing to do to a new machine, but the MacBook Pro comes with a lot of pre-installed languages, printer drivers, and trial applications that do nothing but waste space.  My disk had about 19 GB of stuff on it out of the box; after the clean install I had that down to 4 GB.  A few GB saved doesn't matter much in a desktop, but when you are limited to 120GB, every little bit matters.

Despite the hype I'm not a big fan of OS X, so I'm primarily running Windows XP using Apple's Boot Camp product, which allows just that.  (I may not like OS X much, but Apple's hardware is first-rate, which is why I bought an Apple laptop to run Windows.)

I had no trouble setting up a 100GB partition for Windows and installing the XP operating system was just like any other PC.  The Boot Camp 1.1.2 drivers seem to work, though there are a few glitches you can read about on Apple site.  It's beta software after all, so there are bound to be growing pains, though there aren't any show stoppers.  All the important stuff works with XP under Boot Camp: wireless, Bluetooth, audio, and above all the display drivers (my need for 3D acceleration is why I went with Boot Camp over Parallels).  Even FireWire 800 operates at full speed under XP, at least with external hard drives, which I wasn't expecting because XP has some known issues with FW800.  Apple seems to have taken care of everything, and I look forward to the final version.  There are still a few minor things missing, like the back-lit keyboard, which works under OS X but not yet under XP.

Anyway, so far this is a gorgeous laptop for OS X or Windows XP.
I owned an Apple Powerbook G4 before, and unfortunately I had also 2 PC's at home, and there is nothing to compare.

Using the mac is a total experience, in everything - especially the small details. It is fast. So fast! The screen is brighter than any other screen I have seen. The power cord is very safe, since I know my computer will not drop. The wireless card has better reception than other computers, the sound quality is better, the battery recharges faster and holds for longer, compared to other laptops (we have a Gateway PC and a powerbook G4, but also compared to friends).

Notice, I am not talking about the incredible OS, or the other temptations. It is just the best machine out there, for everything.

Put the OS on top of it, and you get a perfect user experience.

Especially that using BootCamp or other softwares you can now run Windows on it.

I never wrote a recommendation without reservations, but here is one. I may not be crazy on the apple as a company, and the way they monopolize the MP3 market (in the same way the MS is doing to PC's), but when it comes to this product, it is simply great.
I've owned this for 2.5 weeks and am more than a little discouraged with the product.  My MacBookPro 15" shuts down at random - seemingly when it gets too hot and right before the fans should probably have kicked in.  I've wasted time on Apple support trying to install the Firmware Restore CD - etc etc etc.  Still the same old thing.  The support  told me that the mother board had to be replaced.  It will only take two weeks to receive.  I've had this thing two weeks and the first week I had it, the optical drive went bad and had to be replaced.  The apple store has had it more than I have.

In the meantime, I did find a fix.  I got a sport ice bag and placed it under the laptop and as long as it stays cold, it won't shut off and I don't loose all my work.  I never read the claim that ice wasn't included with the purchase of this machine, but that seems to be the requirement.

I'm so disappointed with this machine!!!  I'm ready to throw it back to Apple and forget the whole transaction ever existed.  With all the hype I read about great Apple support - I've yet to see it.  It's far worse than enything I ever experienced with my Dell laptops in the past.
As others have said this is an excellent machine and I have had no problems with it so I am going to skip the obvious and get to the point.  As a photographer I decided that I would purchase the matte screen.  The matte screen has a better viewing angle which is very imporant when evaluating exposure and color adjustments.  My wife has a standard MacBook which comes with the glossy screen.  Side by side the same image does appear more vivid on the MacBook however, if you are not looking at the screen from the ideal position the brightness and contrast fall off remarkably.

Another thing I find annoying when working with the glossy screen are reflections.  Most of the time I don't notice them but when I am evaluating the detail in a photo the subtle reflections from lights or other things catch my eye every time.

As a parting note, if you still can't decide between the two screen types you can always pick one and find an external display with the opposite coating to have the best of both worlds.
I just came back from a 3-day trip - my first travel experience with the MacBook Air. I do own a first generation MacBook Pro and was honestly tempted at first to bring it along in case I need "it". "It" mainly referred to the DVD drive, built-in ethernet and perhaps superior hard-drive speed/access time. I decided to go with the MacBook Air alone (and the USB ethernet adapter) - and see what happens.

It went great. First of all, the bag on my shoulder felt almost unreasonably light. Battery life was more than sufficient to support my three-hour flight with about 25% of capacity left at the end. Connecting to the internet at the airport (via wi-fi) and in the hotel (USB-ethernet adapter) was a breeze (note, however, that I did need the $29 USB-ethernet adapter).

At the conference, laptop-envy abounded... quite amazing, actually. The reaction of someone who has never seen it to its size, sturdiness, and form factor is quite impressive.

I ichatted with my family without problems with good quality video; the systems overall felt a bit more responsive than my 2-year old MacBook Pro with the first-generation Core Duo chip.

If you want a light, thin, sturdy laptop with full-size keyboard, a gorgeous screen, MacOS X (10.5), and you don't necessarily need a CD/DVD drive (you can buy an external one, but somehow lugging this extra piece around somehow defies the purpose of the MBA), and can put up with not "optimal" hard-drive performance, then the MBA is exactly what you want!
I would buy the USB-ethernet adapter, though.

If you need high-speed performance, FireWire, a high-end graphics card, a built-in DVD/CD drive etc, then the MBA is not for you - but I guess then you would not be looking at this page...;)

Honestly, I could not be happier with my purchase. My MB Pro will be up on eBay soon...

Update:

I have been using my MacBook Air now for 4 weeks and have taken it on several trips. This now allows me to update some of the comments made before.

- Battery life: I am quite happy with the battery life which easily allows 3-4 hours of text processing, PowerPoint slide generation, and EndNote work. For me this mainly happens on flights which allows to lower the brightness of the LED screen to save power. I have not pushed my MBA to play videos. In fact, I have no digital entertainment files on it since these files can fill up the (limited) space on the drive quite fast.

- Ports: One USB port is not enough! For instance, if you have to connect to the internet via USB adapter (again, still indispensable!), you block the one and only USB port - unless you carry a USB hub along (Belkin has a nice 4-port one with a swivel design, but quite pricey). Thus, I have added a small USB hub to my travel utensils.

- Design: The MBA still turns heads and sparks comments. In fact, on one of my flights the captain himself left the cockpit to take a look after one of the flight attendants had told him about the MBA on my lap...

- Heat: The MBA is MUCH cooler than my MacBook Pro. You can easily keep it on your lap without feeling uncomfortable.

My wish list for future MBA generations:

- At least 2 USB ports. Should be easy to do.
- Reconsider built-in ethernet - the USB adapter works fine, but blocks the one USB port at this point.
- As soon as larger 1.8'' drives (HD or SSD) are available, they will surely find its way into the MBA to overcome some space limitations.

- It might surprise some, but I honestly do not see a great need for a swapable battery. I would leave it as is in order to keep the amazing form factor.
Was one of the first to order this as it was just what I was looking for...it's stunning! Beautiful!

I noticed that I never used my dvd/cd drives so this laptop works perfect for me as I travel a lot and with
everything else I carry around, I don't need a big clunky laptop in a big clunky case to carry around too.
This laptop fits in my existing briefcase easily with my other inter-office envelopes!

Like the iphone, its solidly built but not heavy. I have no fear that it will break in my briefcase.

I have been pondering for years to buy a 10" vaio from Sony. This is many times better with the large screen, full size keyboard, and of course Mac OS operating system means I don't have to have an anti-virus software that slows my computer down to a crawl and screws up my computer every time it is upgraded. Its cheaper than the vaio I was going to buy also.

This is  perfect for me. I have a few year old powerbook I keep at home, just in case, but I think I'm going to have to turn that on every once in awhile to keep the battery going as I'm using the MBA all the time.
Well It has been a couple months of constant use, and the hype is all gone over the MacBook Air, so what do I think of it now???

IT IS GREAT!!!

Specs for the machine I have:
CPU: 1.83GHz Intel Core 2 Duo
RAM: 2GB
HDD: 80GB

ok, ok, let me go through the Pros and Cons.

Pros:
- Extremely portable
- Great battery life
- Very light weight

Cons:
- Only 1 USB port

What it is for:
- Writing
- Email
- Web surfing
- Light business applications
- Travel
- Simple graphics editing

What it is NOT for:
- Video editing
- Advanced photo editing
- Virtual Machines

When it is all said and done, this is a great machine FOR ITS INTENDED USE. A lot of reviews were negative because the reviewers were morons and somehow thought this machine would perform like a $5000 17' MacBook Pro. When you look at this machine for what it is, a super portable and lightweight laptop, it does a great job. I use the machine as my main laptop at work. It is so nice to be able to just pick it up and take it anywhere on campus with no trouble. It's a productivity booster if you figure you can have your laptop with you at all times. I really have not had any issues with this machine as my main machine, and that is saying a lot since I switched to this machine from a top of the line 17' MacBook Pro. I would say for being Apple's first contender in this space, it is a HUGE success, despite some of the asinine reviews I have seen. "no optical drive :(" my response to that is , it's 2008 get a clue.

I still think it's amazing they were able to cram everything they did into this machine.
This laptop broke after just a few uses.  Being the first time to choose a mac air, I was needless to say, very disappointed.  Apple support, which I fortunately never needed to use for my ipod, was not the least bit helpful.  I would recommend a netbook or a dell laptop, save yourself the headache.
I've had my Air for six months and have used it almost daily. I agree with the comments of others who have said that it is not suitable as a main computer but it is perfect for travel or any other situation in which mobility is key. The keyboard is very comfortable for high intensity writing, the screen is bright (and not overly glossy), and the backlit keyboard is fun. I watch video on my Air all the time and I have never experienced overheating. I use the wireless everyday and, again, no problems.

Overall, this has been the most useful computer I have ever owned.
I was happy with the unit received until it developed a horizontal line of dead pixels in the lower half of the screen.  I ended up taking it to my local Apple store and they exchanged it with a new one in spite the fact I purchased the original unit from Amazon.

This was our first Mac and compared to Windows it's quality was superior.  Don't forget to get the externl DVD (SuperDrive).  You'll need it if you plan to use BootCamp software to dual boot your MacBook Air from Mac or Windows.
Beautiful beautiful beautiful.  It's an Apple; I work on music production as well as architectural graphic design on this thing and it keeps up with no issues.  Did I mention it was beautiful?
OMG simple words cannot describe how much I love my macbook air! Trust me, after you convert from a pc to a mac, you will understand why the designs and functionality is different. I can totally understand why a useless CD rom drive wasn't included and why bluetooth and wireless n was. I can understand why the lenovo /ibm thinkpad x300 simply sucks compare to this because of it's ugly design and speed. This laptop ladies and gentlemen, is the laptop you wanna use at home, in your office, on the go, in the office shop, and in libraries. I love cars, if I were to compare, this laptop would be like my Porsche and the x300 would be like a ugly Japanese car that has more functions than you ever need. Simplicity IS elegant. Everyday when I use this laptop IT makes me happy. Just like every time when I step into my Porsche and that alone, makes my day.

One other thing is, NO MORE COMPUTER VIRUS! Imagine you can open emails without been afraid, and surf the internet to whatever website you want!
I bought the machine about 6 months ago from amazon and hardly used it until now, since I already had two additional notebooks.
This machine has serious performance issues and design flaws esp. considering the premium price you pay.
There are many flaws but I will point to the most glaring one ....
The machine heats up badly after you try to watch anything for 5 minutes which is graphic oriented like an online video on amazon on-demand. Fan starts running at 6200 RPM (max speed) and then everything slows drown drastically and you are forced to shutdown.

I took my machine to the apple repair center and after keeping the machine for 1 week they said that there is nothing wrong with it and it is performing as per designed capabilities!!!!
I came back and checked the internet and this seems to be ever present problem with all the 1st generation macbook Air. Apple is -- after 8 months of launching the 1st generation -- making major revamps in hardware by adding an external graphic card to improve performance.
Knowing this, I feel cheated as apple sold me an 'Experimental' product and fooled to pay such a price for a junk I cant put to a meaningful use.
And I plan to refrain from apple products (although my old macbook did not give any major problems).
I considered my options for a long time before deciding to purchase the MacBook Air, and have not regretted it.  Purchasing this older model after waiting for the new one shaved a couple of hundred bucks off the price. It's not the machine for everyone, but it was for me for these reasons:

- weight matters. The (obvious) primary and only reason to buy this machine.  The latest MacBook weighs just 1 1/2 lbs more, but it still makes a difference on my old back and in the volume it takes up in my bags. This is a laptop I finally use on my lap (heat generated notwithstanding)

- have another Mac. That serves for the optical drive for installs and backups. If necessary, I always have the option of buying the external superdrive.

- don't really use optical drives much to begin with. The only thing I miss is not being able to watch a DVD on the laptop, but not often enough.

- no heavy duty computing needed - it's an alternate machine, not the primary. Mostly Internet and writing, although I could run Photoshop, etc... if I wanted to (if I can on an old MacMini, I can here). VMware runs fine, and have no heavy disk storage requirements.

- can get by with the limited port configuration (1 USB port, no Firewire, no Ethernet).

If weight doesn't matter to you, and the other factors are too limiting, then you'd be much better off with the Macbook or the MacBook Pro which meet all your needs and can serve as  your primary computer at a better price/value ratio. Or you don't care much for Apple, and have minimal computing needs, one of those tiny PC/Linux laptops would do the job for a lot less.
I have my MBA for six month right now. Overall I am almost happy, but.... Wireless antenna is not as powerful as I need. My MB pro can "see" 15 networks near my home, MBA only 6!!!!
Sometimes It takes more than 30 minute to have internet access at airports and other places.
Each time I arrive home it says "there is not preferred networks in range"  !!! and it is my Home network!.
This beauty travels really easy, everybody  looks at it and it is sturdy.  The lack of connectivity, the insufficient USB ports, and the underperformance make me think that I have something nice but close to useless.
I remember when my dad bought an iMac.  a 333Mhz Graphite DV.  The thing it was missing was unbelievable!  How could you possibly function without a floppy drive!  This computer will never make it.  Fast forward 9 years.  The MBA comes out with no optical drive.  Sure, not the first laptop, but neither was the iMac without a floppy.  Now we see, no laptop or desktop comes with a floppy of any kind.  I do believe the MBA will do the same with the optical drive.  It is really the one thing limiting designs of computers.  Sure, you can be thin, but have to be at least six inches wide, to hold an optical drive.  Flash should fix this problem.  I can fit twice as much on a thumb drive as a DL DVD at a tenth the space. so on to the MBA.  Any software or movie I want, I download over the internet.  I have rarely needed the optical drive with this computer.
(+)  I went from a Blackbook to this.  All I do on my computer is surf the internet, check email, listen to music, watch movies/TV shows.  This does it all.  This thing is holding 15 gigs of music, 10 gigs of pictures, Spore, and I have 29.29 gigs free.  Did I mention Spore?  This thing runs Spore quite well.  Someone said this thing is underpowered, have they actually tried doing anything on it, or are they just looking at the specs?  Weight.  This thing is light, but unlike an x300 or Sony TT/TZ, looks good doing it.  Backlight.  Beautiful screen, very clear and bright.  Keyboard.  Didn't think they could improve from the iBook keyboard, but they did with the Macbook, put it in the air and added backlighting.  Perfect.  Case.  Sturdy, easy to clean, doesn't pick up fingerprints, though like the MBP, hurts Wifi.  I can hook it up to my 1080p LCD, this thing will output 1920x1080 while watching Hulu, couldn't ask for more.
(-) No optical drive, one usb port, no ethernet, no firewire, non-replaceable battery, small HDD, poor graphics.  If you put these under negative, than you are missing the point.  Apple makes it pretty clear before you drop your hard-earned cheddar that it has none of these things.  It is like saying you bought a new convertible, but you are disappointed it won't haul your dining room table.  You know it is 4" off the ground and 2WD but still make a point that it can't go off-road.  No sht.  On to the real negatives.  I cannot install boot camp without a Superdrive.  I tried using an LG usb powered DVD burner that I bought with my EEE.  Work great for everything on the air except Boot camp.  Probably no firmware in the BIOS to run it.  Hinge.  Seems delicate, I have seen many a cracked in half MBA because people think this thing can lay flat.  Ambient sensor.  Too sensitive.  In low light conditions, it constantly adjusts the brightness of the screen and keyboard.  I realize I can turn it off, but it does work well in light and dark situations.
Other than that, excellent machine.  I would recommend it to anyone who understands its capabilities as well as its limitations.
I bought the mac book air for my son who started college this September . He is  excited and very pleased with it . The only concern he has is that  there  is  no internal CD/dvd drive so he had to buy an external one . That is  perhaps due to the thinness of the machine.
The thing  I like  best about the machine is the weight ,esay to carry around and very thin . I will be  buying one  for myself very soon. To any one who carries a laptop this is the one  for  you and in the night  or dark areas ,perfect  with the lighted keyboard .
I cannot comment on its  performance  but  based on looks and  what  my son says  , this is the  laptop to get .
I bought this laptop shortly after it was launched. I'm a college student and this was my first mac. I've always used windows since elementary. Let my start by saying that this laptop is amazingly portable. For years, I've waited for apple to release an ultraportable laptop. I was so eager to leave windows because of the crappy operating system and I always find myself waiting impatiently for my old sony vaio sz to boot because of all the antivirus programs that open before I can do anything further. However I've held back in buying a mac because the smallest laptop at that time is macbook which is an inch thick 5 lb notebook and that is not portable enough for me. After hearing the release of MBA, Immediately bought it. After 6 months of owning this laptop, I would say that it is the best computer I've ever owned.

Although the specs is not that impressive. I find my laptop fast enough to handle my needs. Also, its sexiness and thinness is always a plus. it's so light and thin that I don't notice much difference when I lug it around campus in my backpack. Also,the battery life is very good. I take notes with my laptop during school days and my friends are always amazed that my macbook air can last all day w/o me ever plugging it.
I have been the informal tech guy for two Airs.  One for 8 months, one for 6 months.  I have also traveled with them.  They are generally wonderful, especially if the weight is a big factor.  All other laptops seem heavy and inelegant.  But ...

(1) If you ever want to use an ethernet connection to the internet (as opposed to wireless), then you have to bring the dongle that converts the one USB port to ethernet.  For example, to check your office email at a Kinko's. Definitely buy it.  You will want to travel with this and an ethernet cable, in case your hotel room has an ethernet connection and no (or poor) wireless reception.

(2) To do a quick full restore from Time Machine, you need BOTH an OSX disc (either Disc 1 that comes with the Air or an off-the-shelf OSX disc) and the back-up hard drive.  But you only have one USB port and no firewire ports.  The SuperDrive will not share that port on a USB hub (nor will it work on any computer but an Air). It is easy to back up with Time Machine to a small external drive.  (We used a Western Digital Passport.) But consider using a Time Capsule or an external hard drive that has its own power supply. The powered external drive is not elegant, but if you ever need to do a full restore (and you might because your Air will lead a hard life, especially if it is a student's life), it will save you a couple of hours if you use a powered external hard drive.  The SuperDrive that you can buy for the Air (and you should buy it, it is small and light) does not work from a USB hub.  A powered DVD drive from another manufacturer (ours is from Toshiba) works on a powered USB hub.  The WD Passport would not connect to the Air via a powered USB hub (at least through the hub I used, and that hub has had problems).  But a powered WD MyBook external hard drive did connect to the Air via the powered hub. So use a powered external hard drive for your Time Machine backups, and if you need to do a full restore, get a powered USB hub and a powered external DVD drive with a USB output.  The Apple Genius Bar might not have these.  Note: See (11) and (12) below for alternate methods for a full restore, in one of which the WD Passport worked fine.

(3) The Genius Bar geniuses know a lot more about the MacBook than the Air because the Air is still relatively new.

(4) If you ever do a full "restore and erase" from the two discs that come with the Air, you need to know this:  At the end of first disc, about 1.5 hours into the process, it flashes "Get ready to insert Disc 2."  Then it reboots and eventually says "Installing. Calculating time remaining" and ejects the disc.  It does NOT say "Insert Disc 2".  If maybe you were not watching it for the entire first 1.5 hours, you would not have seen the message at the end of Disc 1 before the reboot.  What it wants when it ejects Disc 1 is for you to insert Disc 2.  Not very brilliant programming.  Every two-disc Windows program and game says "Insert Disc 2 and press Enter." Not these install discs.  I found out when I went to the Genius bar and the Genius restarted the install process. He went to lunch and I watched the computer for two hours (this is what I want you to avoid), so I happened to see the message at the end of disc one. It was a special moment in my life.

(5) Be careful where you put the Air and the SuperDrive.  I heard of someone throwing out their Air with the Sunday paper.  Might be an urban legend, but we lost a SuperDrive, possibly the same way.

(6) Backups to Time Machine are more likely to happen if you use a Time Capsule as a wireless router + external hard drive.  You can also print through Time Capsule, instead of plugging the printer into the Air when you need to print.  Be sure to have the printer plugged into the Time Capsule and turned on before you install the Time Capsule.  Otherwise, you will probably need to call Apple Care to walk you through the re-install with the printer.  Don't get off the phone until the printer works and Time Machine works, not just the wireless internet.  For a student whose life is on the Air, I would definitely consider the Time Capsule an essential accessory to the Air.  For someone who uses the Air as an occasional computer for travel and has her life on an iMac with an ethernet connection to the internet, the Time Capsule is nice but not necessary.

(7) Get a neoprene sleeve for the Air.  Then when it is thrown into a backpack or briefcase, it will be safer.  Also, in its sleeve on a desk it is less of an object of desire for thieves (in my humble opinion).  After all these months, the Air is still eye candy (as you well know if you got this far in this review).  Consider a color other than black, which is harder to see and find.

(8) I understand that the wireless antenna is in the hinge that attaches the screen to the body of the Air.  So it is somewhat directional.  Try sliding it around to get better reception.  You can check the packet flow in the Activity Monitor in Utilities to see what works best.

(9) Wireless reception does not seem to be a strength of the two Airs that I use.  The 4 MacBooks that preceded the two Airs in our lives seemed to get more consistently good wireless reception.  This is a shame, because the Air depends more on its wireless than the MacBooks, which have real ports.  In future generations of the Air I hope that Apple finds a way to get the best possible wireless reception for the Air.

(10)  The 80 GB hard drive in the Air is not big enough for a student's life if the student likes to store music and videos on it.  An outboard hard drive is a distant second-best solution.  (I liked the WD Passport for this, since it does not need external power and it is small, reliable and travels well.  Consider wrapping it in bubble wrap in your backpack or briefcase.  USB power is enough for this drive since you will not be doing a full Time Machine restore from this drive.  To backup the stuff on this drive, you will need another solution, which might be Time Machine on the Time Capsule.  Update:  I attach the WD Passport and the printer to the USB port on the Time Capsule with a USB mini hub (not a powered hub), store videos on the Passport and back up the Air and Passport with Time Machine to the Time Capsule's hard drive.  I wish the backup was not in the same room as the backed-up drives, but it is a lot better than no backup.)

(11) It is easy to connect the Air to another computer to use the other computer's CD or DVD drive.  You need a good wireless connection for both computers.  The Air asks the other computer for permission each time, and the other computer has to give permission each time.  I connected to another Air and could use the SuperDrive on the second Air.  I have heard of people using this as a way to access the OSX DVD when they do a quick full restore from Time Machine to the Air. I tried, could connect, but could not do a quick restore this way.  The problem was that the both the OSX disc and the original Disc 1 that comes with the Air cause a reboot.  After the reboot, the Air could not see the DVD drive in the other computer.  End of quick restore process.

(12)  Update:  To do a full restore from Time Machine to the Air:  Do an Erase and Restore with the start up disc or an OSX disc.  Two hours later, when this is DONE and you have a fresh computer, it asks if you want to restore from a hard drive using Time Machine.  THEN you start the restore.  (At that point the restore process is finished with the DVD and you can unplug the SuperDrive and plug in your external hard drive, whether powered or not.  The WD Passport worked fine to restore at this point in the process.) The whole process (including the restore from Time Machine) takes many hours, but it works great and you do NOT need a powered external DVD drive; the SuperDrive works fine for this.  This waste of two hours (for the erase and restore) is the cost of a small, light computer, I guess.  Now you know, too.  I hope this saves you from the frustration that
I experienced.

Given all that, every Air owner I know would buy another one if they lost theirs.  None would go back to a MacBook.  (I do know people for whom the weight is not a big issue and who want more horsepower and ports and sometimes screen size, especially for games.  They are happy with their MacBooks as their main computers.)  Except for the wireless reception, the problems of the Air are problems for the tech person, not so much for the day-to-day user.  Which is a good design choice.

(Note:  Four months later: We now have two students using 80GB Airs and they both love them.  Both use external drives, too.  (WD Passports.)  My wife had her Air stolen out of an unlocked car.  Don't ask why it was unlocked.  It was in a backpack with the superdrive, ethernet dongle, external hard drive, wireless mouse, etc. and they took the backpack.  We had Lojack for Laptops on it and the LAPD got it back for us.  Just the computer, but we did not complain.  It took four weeks.  I recommend Lojack for Laptops.  The only hard part is remembering that you have Lojack on there.  The sooner you remember and file a police report, the sooner you will get your laptop back.)
After being used to traveling with a MacBook Pro I wondered if the MacBook Air would have enough performance and capacity to satisfy my needs.

This is a beautiful machine.  Extremely thin but very sturdy feeling.  Wonderfully light even with required accessories.  A terrific screen and keyboard that are a pleasure during all day use.  Good battery life (about 4 hours in my case).  Good processor and graphics power for mainstream business applications.  Adequate disk space but limited disk performance.  Barest minumum of ports requires dongles and a usb hub.

While its slower than my Macbook pro, the only times I really notice a difference are:
- Booting the machine takes longer (but I usually only do that a couple times a week)
- Starting some applications takes longer (but once started I can still run a LOT of apps in 2gb even including Parallels)
- True multitasking is limited to one intensive disk or cpu operation at a time (don't try and use the machine for anything significant while doing a backup, or while ripping a DVD).

So under normal use I was very pleasantly surprised how useable the AIR felt after being used to a PRO.  For me the size and weight reduction is definitely worth the performance reduction.

Yes I would like a bigger, faster hard drive, but next year 120gb 5400rpm single platter units should be available.  Yes I would like a built in ethernet port, but I'm not willing to pay a big form factor price to avoid the $29 dongle.  Yes I would like 2-3 USB ports, but Targus makes some really tiny 4 port hubs for now.

I'm honestly not sure I would make any different design choices, and technology progress will take care of the only thing I've found to be occasionally very limiting (disk size and performance).
I am using this as a replacement for my iMac which I moved to the office.  This computer is the best laptop I have ever owned (the first Mac), and I am in love with the operating system.  I don't have to worry about viruses or other nonsense like that like I use to have to deal with all the time with my old Dell laptop.  Plus its so light I can take it anywhere!

The only thing I don't like about it is that it doesn't have a firewire port.  However, all in all I am very happy and could not have imagined a more perfect computer.
i just purchased this computer a week ago so i suppose things could change but at this point the computer has been great. The portability was a huge factor for me as it should be for anybody contemplating the purchase of this laptop.  As a student i don't really need this computer for much more than word documents, internet, email, itunes, and the occasional movie/youtube video. Speed has not been an issue - something i wasn't sure about as i almost purchased the SSD option.  Fortunately i didn't and this has been fine.  I ordered the superdrive just in case though i havn't used it yet.  For installing microsoft office i used the remote disc drive and that worked absolutely fine.  So far the fan/overheating problem that other people were talking about hasn't been an issue and the temp does get warm, but not hot enough to get laggy or be uncomfortable.  So far my two nitpicks are that the battery isn't great - 4+ hours of internet/itunes if the screen brightness is down all the way... but i like to keep the brightness at at least 50%.  The other thing is that the screen hinge design doesn't allow the screen to go very far back.  As far as the port limitations go the only thing i use is audio jack, usb, and ethernet at school but there's wifi too.  I did order the ethernet dongle just in case.  An ethernet cable and maybe one more usb (tho that too isn't too big of a deal for me) would be nice, but still, i'm totally happy with my purchase :)
I bought the Macbook Air for my daughter who is a 'die hard' Mac person. She uses her Mac Pro everyday for her work. She has told me three times how much she loves this new laptop. That makes the purchase a 10.
As a hardcore PC user I could not have been more amazed at the beauty and simplicity of a the MacBook Air. It is a jewel. Completely satisfied.
I have been very pleased with my Mac book Air. It has worked perfect since I first turned it on. Migrated from my old Mac Book without a hitch. Booted the Mac Book Air and everything was there even parallels and windows with all my windows programs intact. I love it.
It was a gift to me so I can finish writing a book. It's so lightweight that I carry it around with ease. I am able to write in bed, too. It's really a blessing since I'm on the go so much. This laptop also performs wonderfully. I love it. I highly recommend it.
Good for checking emails, and very light word/excel processing work. Otherwise it is really more a gadget than a real computer. Hard drive is too small for using it as a standard computer as you cannot store much info/data. Processing power too slow and even airport does not pick up all signals. Nice gadget...that's all it is. I do not recommend it.
Its actually better than the best laptop ever.  This is one of the greatest pieces of electronics ever created.
Wish there was more hard drive memory, but if you store files online you don't really need all that much hard drive space.
I also wish the battery life was better.
But other than those two things its a must have.

I cannot begin to describe how much I love this laptop!  I won't provide a technical review as I am sure other reviewers are much more competent to do so.  I purchased this laptop for work and graduate school as soon as they came out.  I first switched to Apple about 3 years ago, and since that time I have owned a PowerBook G4 12" which I traded up for the MacBook Pro 15" and decided it was too big (can you tell I want something small?).  So, when the MacBook Air came out, I gave my husband my Pro and purchased this.  I couldn't be more satisfied with it.  It is fast, well-constructed and lightweight with a beautiful, clear screen, all of which are essentials for my computer happiness!  The touchpad is awesome...I find myself wishing that my iMac mouse had a similar feature.  I do not find the lack of an optical drive problematic; I purchased the $99 external drive and, as I said, also have an iMac, so program installation, CD uploading, etc., is not a problem for me.  The external drive is also small enough that you can pack it up in your case and bring it with you if need be.  The battery life is fantastic: I can take class notes for 3 hours straight and still have plenty of juice for another hour or two of use...if I had to estimate battery time, I'd say it consistently gives me 4 1/2 to 5 hours of use.  I do not do a lot of video editing or gaming, etc., but I do use this for way more than email, including tons of writing, business uses, and web design.  It isn't the task master that the Pro's are, but it's convenience makes up for any shortcomings.  So, it basically comes down to what works for you, and because my primary computer is an iMac, the portability, speed, and ease of use of the MacBook Air is a great choice.
Airbook is the best for traveling
across town or across the country!
I highly recommend it!
I purchased the this laptop because I wanted a super-portable computer with full functionality. I used to leave my old laptop at home because I didn't want to carry its 6 pounds around with me all day just because I *might* use it. Now I take the MBA with me everywhere and work when and where I want. (I'm a graduate student and I walk a lot.) I'm super impressed with the intuitive interface and the overall beauty of the machine - but note this is my first apple. I am not concerned with what some people say are the limitations of this machine because I use it mainly for writing, reading documents and the internet. The processing speed and HD space are very satisfactory for my needs.

Note: I applied the Zagg invisible shield to the top and bottom of the laptop, because the aluminum is quite sensitive to scratches.
I read a lot of reviews on the Web complaining about MacBook Air single USB port, lack of built-in Ethernet port, external SuperDrive, etc. as major issues... Come on! This is an ultra portable, thin and light notebook, without compromising  screen and keyboard sizes, plus amazing screen and multitouch technologies... If you love breakthrough products, buy yours today! :D
This is my backup and travel computer at my MacPro would not really travel well.
First things first, this is probably not he computer you should be using as a primary computer, but as a second computer is excels.
I like the fact that I can fit it in my business folio and take it to work use it on my breaks and when I have some free time.  It is also quite solid I had no fear of damaging it holding it on it's edges.
The feature I like best is the screen.  They use the new LED backlighting instead of fluorescent so it is more energy efficient and way brighter then any other of Apple's displays even ont he MacBook Pro.
As for the 80gb vs solid state drive.  I got the 80gb because while the solid state will read data faster and boot up and open applications faster then a MacBook Pro the 80gb drive writes data faster, and well I did not buy this computer for it's speed anyway.
By the way if you are concerned about the size of the hard drive I'll let you know what I do and hope it helps.  When I am away I leave my MacPro on and set up my .mac account with Back to my Mac.  I have a AT&T 3G wireless card and with that combo I can access the 1TB drive and all the applications on my MacPro.  It will not obviously run as fast but it is the closest you will get to a 1.08 TB laptop at this point.
This laptop is a bit pricey, compared to laptop PCs, but it is comparably priced to the Mac Book Pro. The issue with this laptop is that it doesn't have a DVD drive, which questions its claim of being "portable." The laptop itself is about 0.76 inches thick, but if it included a DVD drive, it probably would have been 2-3 inches, which is about the same thickness as any other laptop! So, really, the only accomplishment in my opinion is removing the DVD drive!

I guess I don't see what makes the Air so much better than the Mac Book Pro, but I guess it's just a matter of perspective. I suppose some people  "only" use the DVD drive to install programs and watch DVD movies, in which case portability might be more of an issue.

I didn't buy a Mac Air; I went with the Pro. Like I said, though, it's just a matter of perspective.
There are so many opinions floating around about this latest Apple innovation, my simple reply is to think what works best for yourself.  The *plus* in one's views may be the *minus* in another's.  The Macbook Air is the perfect answer for my way of using a notebook computer.  Study the forums, learn the features, and decide if it works.  When you read the negative reviews, remember it could just be the Air does not fit the user's needs. Just as most all other notebooks do not fit my needs.  The Air is for the simple, uncluttered life.  When you KNOW yourself, this removes much of the confusion. Apple has heavy-duty alternatives, while the Air simply does exactly as it was designed to do... keeping your life simple, uncluttered AND productive.
I did a fair amount of soul-searching before pulling the trigger on this purchase, in large part because of all the "compromises" apparently required to make as thin as this one is.  For me, the MBA replaced a ThinkPad T-40, which has been as sturdy, consistent, and feature-laden as it is unattractive.  My worry was that, though I was sure I would like the size and appearance of the MBA, maybe I would miss the T-40's feature set.  Worse, I might miss a particular feature while traveling.  So, I almost didn't buy the MBA.

I needn't have worried -- the MBA is simply incredible.  As others have mentioned, the case is quite sturdy.  Apple's engineers ingeniously relied on some of the internal components themselves as part of the skeleton for the case.  This sounds scary, except that they were designed to serve both functions. The keyboard is crisp and comfortable (and keep in mind that I'm coming from a very well-regarded keyboard in the ThinkPad).  The trackpad gestures more than make up for all of the extra keys the ThinkPad has.  Although it takes some getting used to, the three-finger swipe, the two finger "right-click", pinching/expanding, etc., are all intuitive, comfortable, and fairly addictive.  I've even started missing them on my desktop.  The screen is really impressive -- a *big* improvement from my previous laptop.  And battery life has been just fine -- definitely not the advertised five hours, but consistently well over three.

What do I miss? Honestly, not much.  I've started using downloaded movies when I travel, including iTunes rentals.  They all look just as good as a DVD did (on a laptop, at least) and are better for battery life.  When I use an external mouse, I use a Bluetooth wireless model, so it doesn't take up the USB port.  I was never a battery-swapper anyway, so that's not an issue.  (I'll probably gripe about the built-in battery every couple of years when I replace it, then forget it the rest of the time.)  And I can't save everything I have on the hard drive, though it holds everything that I would ever need on-the-go.  I don't even miss the Ethernet port, as I travel with an Airport Express, and have for years.  For me, the only real downside is the speed of opening applications.  Opening most apps is noticeably and annoyingly slower than with my desktop (or, presumably, than all of the other Apple notebooks).  However, once open, they do just fine.  I now leave them open, which Apple says is fine, and speed is more than adequate.

As a disclaimer, I should mention that I'm a lawyer, so my usage doesn't involve heavy graphic or media work.  I tend to run the Microsoft Office suite, Safari, iTunes, iPhoto, watch movies, and use the internet.  For those types of things, the MBA comfortably meets my needs.  I've even added VM Ware's Fusion program (running Windows XP) and, once loaded, it does the job as well.  A speed demon this computer isn't, but if you use general productivity software and Apple's consumer applications, you'll probably be very happy.
The good: I thought it wouldn't be as sturdy as it is, but it is!  The screen is great.  very thin and truly ultraportable, though not quite as light as you might think.  overall, a truly beautiful laptop.  i also think the price is excellent--a very fair price for such a nice ultraportable computer.  most any serious computer user can afford this beauty.  the power chord is great.

the bad: no optical drive, means no dvds, not cd installs, unless using another computer, by which it can use file sharing to transfer the data over wireless, which is FAR from ideal.  this is a big downer, as everyone will want to watch a dvd sometime, expecially on the plane or on a trip...  you should definitely buy a usb thumb drive or two, a usb hub, a usb ethernet device, and a nice case to go along with the purchase. u can buy an external cd/dvd player/burner, but lugging that along kills the form factor and portability of the unit.  battery life is about 3-4 hours, for me, per charge, which is OK, not great considering i'm just surfing and using imail 3/4 of the time. throwing in a neoprene case or something should have been included for an 1800 dollar laptop.  i have no problem buying one seperately, but throwing in a 5-10 dollar case would have been considerate, and other high-end laptop mfgrs throw this in.

the ugly:  video capabilities are weak, just sufficient enough to get by.  i can't edit movies with imovie nearly as well as i can with my macbook pro (1.8 ghz). and i'm afraid as more programs become more graphics intensive, this may be a big problem after a few years. harddrive speed is noticably inferior--the read access time and write performance are palpably slower than my other notebooks.  harddrive space is limited as well, and considering there's no dvd/cd player, it magnifies the problem.

I could easily give this 4 stars, but will give it a 3 because it simply can't serve all my needs, no way.  it's terrific as a primary laptop used for email and other light tasks, but if you're a serious computer user, it alone is nowhere near enough.  it's probably worthy of 4 stars for it's overwhelming pro's,  and 5 stars as a secondary/special use laptop, but the con's i mentioned earlier are legitimate and wonder how it's going to to fare with the next generation OS and programs, considering it's pathetic integrated video card.  whereas, i know my macbook pro will be ready for whatever i throw at it for 5 more years.

on a side note, i also own a Dell M1330, and it's just 1.5 lbs heavier, but gives me alot more (cpu, hd, ram, and video!) power for almost half the price.  also a sleek, pretty machine, but definitely not on my MBA's level aestheticly, and is not quite "ultraportable."  still, if you're a pc user, i'd recc'd it.  i have goen through a dozen notebooks over the past 6 years, handing them down to friends and family, and i now down to three (macbook pro, air, m1330, plus a desktop imac, and 1 desktop pc).  don't get me wrong though, i currently adore my macbook air, it serves it's purpose very well.  that said, my dell m1330 and my macbook pro are more indispensable and "important" to me.
Let me start with a simple disclaimer, first I worked for Apple (a long time ago) for 11 years, I also worked for Microsoft for 6 years and I'm pretty comfortable in both camps but I truly love Apple for it's design and combined hardware/software implementations.  I go through laptops pretty frequently and have owned UMPC's and full heavyweight desktop replacements.  Having said all that, I think the MacBook Air is a home run IF you fit the right profile.  The profile is that you want a device that you can carry around easily every day from meeting to meeting, home to work, travel, etc.  This is not the laptop for your sole machine, instead it's truly the best device I've every owned for taking notes, staying on top of email, doing some on the fly spreadsheet or database creation, watch ripped or downloaded movies, and generally working through a "normal" business day.  If you're looking for a game machine, power photo processing or video processing laptop, or 1 PC to suit all your needs this isn't the right product.  But for me, it's close to 100% perfect, the battery life is good enough to get me through more than a couple of meetings, I can watch a movie that I rented on iTunes or ripped on a flight, I can easily do all my email on a week long trip, and basically take the machine with me wherever I go without a big penalty in weight or size.  The display is super, the keyboard is wonderful, and I'm personally fine with not having a user replaceable battery.  Bottom line is that, if you are clear about what you need, and understand the trade off's, the MacBook Air is a winner of a portable device.
I have had this little miracle for a couple of weeks and I absolutely love it, in fact I take it with me anywhere I go. Alot fo people are negative about this product because of it's lack of a DVD drive and an ethernet port, I very very rarely use them so it fits me just fine. You should note that the Air was not intended as an all in one computing solution but as an extension of your system. An iMac and Macbook Air would fit perfectely together for around the price of the MacBook Pro.

The fit and finish is spectacular, it feels light yet solid. Other laptops in this weight range feel flimsy, none of that here.

Performance is much better than i had anticipated, the 2GB of ram really do make a diference. It does suffer with very very high resolution 1080P videos but other than that it's pretty snappy. Much more so than any other portable in its range.

I would recomened you stick to this configuration, the higher processor is not worth the extra 300 USD and the SSD drive is definately not worth an extra 1K!!!

What are you waiting for? add the damn thing to your cart already!!!
I purchased a 1.6Ghz 80GB HDD based MacBook Air about 2 weeks ago.  Honestly I was not sure that I would keep the device but I had to review it for myself based on some not so positive reviews and the fact that I own a large amount of Apple stock and have been concerned about the recent drop in the stock price.

My business is to help companies make better products with better overall strategic plans and I have learned from past experience that many "professional" reviewers really don't get it.  Often they write great reviews for terrible products and while not as often they also write terrible reviews for great products.  In a past life I directly managed the widely successful Iomega Zip drive so I speak from a level of experience on this issue.  In short it was easily worth a 10% restocking fee to me to find out what I thought the real truth is.

In my acuitize consulting business we have found that after extensive direct in person customer interviews working with a wide variety of companies with an even wider variety of products that customers really care about only a few key items for each of the products or services they buy.  We call these items the "defining parameters" of any true 10X product or service.  While there are lots of items that must be accomplished well for a true 10X product we find that there are only 3-5 things that must be done to perfection to achieve 10x success.

So what do I now believe?

The quickest answer is that within an hour of my first use there was no way that I was taking the system back.  Words cannot do justice to the sheer brilliance of the industrial design of this product.  It simply "feels" great when you use it and it is so thin and light you become worried that you forgot it on a business trip.  The screen is simply brilliant and far better that any screen I have ever seen on any other laptop I have used or seen to date.  The keyboard, while I am probably the world's worst typist, also "feels" great when you use it.  I have found myself using the system all over my house at all times of day due to the wonderful backlight keyboard & display (& size).  I'd rather go without paying my heat bill than taking back the air!

The Good

- The industrial design and size/weight.
- The screen
- The keyboard
- The overall feeling of a supremely engineered product
-  It's a Mac and it comes with Leopard and iLife 08
- The tradeoffs they made to fit the size/weight requirements are fine with me and largely non-issues (& my issues can be fixed)
-  If you buy it you will love it (ps - I am not connected with Apple in any way)

Interestingly while I have a number of issues with the product I think they could all be easily fixed into the future making the "Air" a true 10x product.  By the way I think you will find my "issues" are largely different from what most reviewers write as the issues.

My issues;

#1 - The price is simply way too high for wild market acceptance

While I would love to do the research to determine the real price points required can you imagine the sales of this product if it were a $499 product ramping up to a $999 product as opposed to the $2K-$3K product it is today?  High volumes will lower manufacturing costs that should allow Apple to do this in the future (an inherently this system should be cheaper to build anyway).  By the way for me the dramatically increased price and lower storage capacity make the solid-state storage option a non-factor for me (I continue to be amazed at what appears to be close to a 50/50 sales mix of the solid-state option to the HDD based option).  Give me a 128GB solid sate drive at a $500 or lower cost and then I will be interested.  Up until then, and speaking as a shareholder rather than a user, I love the mix of sales of the higher end system.

#2 - Migration and Syncing is a disaster

This one amazes me and one I think is a huge disappointment especially from a company like Apple that seems to think this stuff out ahead of time.  It is based on the premise that the vast majority of MacBook air buyers (especially at the current prices) already will own another "main" Mac.  Migration assistant needs to be greatly modified to enable simply and easily dealing with moving only your critical stuff to the air to fit in the limited space available (now it's an all or nothing approach).  Migrating your stuff from another Mac is an enormous pain and waste of time.  Interestingly I think they completely solved a parallel issue to this in the removal of the optical disk drive by enabling remote drive access.  I did buy a $99 superdrive but after 2 weeks it's still in the plastic wrapped box and I doubt I will ever use it.

On a similar issue an what presents a much larger ongoing problem is synching between the air and your "main" Mac.  It is simply a pain to try and keep my Air and iMac synched with the same critical stuff.  From the examples that Apple already set with the iPod and AppleTV with "great" synching capabilities it amazes me they dropped the ball on this feature for the Air.  Apple representatives have told me to use .Mac but I find this an unacceptable answer.  My #1 software priority would be a great wireless simple software synching functionality as per AppleTV and the iPod.

Interesting what was my largest pre-purchase factor was the smallish 80GB hard drive (I really wished it was 120 or 160GB at least).  Now I have found that after a painful couple of days of moving my critical stuff that 80GB is in fact fine for me - just make it easy for me to move my stuff on and off of it.

#3 - I hate the dongle for video presentations (I am afraid I will lose it or leave it behind)

I assume that a lot of traveling professionals are like me and need from time to time to connect the air to an external projector.  While to Apple's credit they do provide the cable as standard I hat the dongle idea.  I think this could be solved by simply shipping the air with a neat internal and inexpensive protective case-in-a-case that can go in your laptop bag that has a standard place for the power adapter and dongles.  On a similar not the low cost remote should have also been included primarily for remote presentations if not for watching movies (at $2K or $3K leaving a $2 cost remote out was a extremely poor strategic decision.).

My bottom line is that, even with these shortcomings, if you can afford it buy the "Air" you will love it!
Is it a compromise?  Well I guess for those who don't mind carrying around a 6 lb portable with all the bells and whistles or an ultraportable with slow processor, small keyboard but with more ports, I guess the MBA is.

Where there is no compromise is in the speed, full sized keyboard, screen clarity and battery life.  With the 64 Gig SSD and 1.8 GHZ 4MB cache processor the speed is the fastest in its class.  While the X300 is the computer that everyone loves to bash the MBA with, I will take the speed of the MBA over the DVD on the X300 anytime.  Plus, it can run both VISTA/XP and OSX.  So it is a better Vista computer and ALSO a MAC. OH and one more thing compared to the X300-you can actually buy an MBA NOW, it has been available for close to a month, while the X300 just got posted on there site and there is a more than (TYPICAL of Lenovo) 4 week ship time-usually in Lenovo jargon that means wait a few months.  It is amazing that Apple used to be the king of announce and wait has now become the company whose products are available (in most cases) on the day or within days of announcement.

My only real complaint is length of time it takes to charge.  Mine is taking about 4 hours.  Hopefully there will be a firmware fix for that.

The keyboard is the best in class, bar NONE, not even the X series by Lenovo.  The screen is bright and crisp.  Load times for Vista is the quickest I have seen (probably because of the SSD).

I have heard complaints that there is no built in 3G or EVDO, but in my opinion, that is a waste.  Why would anyone want that built in unless that is their only computer??  As a person who has more than one laptop and computer, I much rather have a USB 3G or EVDO.  The new Verizon 720 works with the MBA perfectly and has a MicroSDHC slot-for $68 I got the new SanDisk 8 GIG MicroSDHC which works great.
***UPDATE***
I originally purchased the MBA for home - however, due to it's weight and portability - it quickly replaced my work laptop - which was a Dell.

I have Office 2008 for Mac installed, use a Cisco VPN, and Firefox 3 (for .tiff files and some others that Safari didn't work with)  When mobile, I am using a Sprint broadband wireless USB card when I am not using WiFi - and the MBA screams when it comes to running Oracle 11i.

So far, I haven't found anything that makes me miss my Dell.

-----------------------------------------------------------

I purchased a custom configured MBA - I ordered it with the 1.8 Ghz processor and the 80 GB HDD.

So far, I have to say I love this machine!

As some have mentioned - I thought I would miss certain devices - like an Optical drive (CD / DVD) or an Ethernet port - but so far I haven't missed either one!

I get about 3.5 hours to 5 hours out of each charge - and I have the power settings on 'performance' - which is as high as it gets - I imagine if I dialed it back to 'energy saving' I could get more.  My Dell only lasted about 2.5 hours - so I know where all the outlets are in airports / airplanes / lounges when I am on the road.  It is nice to only have to charge half as much!!

I am using my MBA in conjunction with a wireless network at my house.  The remote disk feature worked seamlessly when I installed software from the SuperDrive on my Mac Mini via WiFi to my MBA.  In addition, I installed the remote disk software on my Dell, just to see if I could watch a movie - and I could! (Remote disk allows a user to watch movies the user has created, and install software remotely - however, it doesn't allow a user to watch a commercial DVD remotely)

I thought the MBA would be fairly slow with larger programs such as PhotoShop - surprisingly enough it works just fine!

I am keeping all of the bookmarks, preferences, address books, mail accounts, etc synced between my Mac Mini, MBA, and iPod Touch using my .Mac account.

Any files I want to use between the devices, I use via 'Sharing Files' under preferences in Leopard.

If you haven't used Leopard before - you are in for a treat!

I have Expose set up so every time I move my mouse to the upper left corner of my screen 'All Windows' come to the forefront.  I also have it set so if I move my mouse to the lower left portion of my screen, it launches Spaces.

Spaces is a program that works as if you have 'virtual desktops'.  I set mine up to have 12 'screens' - two rows, six columns.  This means I can be running up to twelve programs - or have up to 12 windows open at a time - move my cursor to the lower left of the screen, enter Spaces and switch between any of the twelve applications / screens - with literally one movement and a click.

Speaking of clicks - I don't use the track pad buttons like I used to - which was odd at first - but, once I got used to using the functions of the new track pad - one finger (tap=left click), two fingers (tap=right click), or three fingers (swipe=next page/screen), two finger pinch= small font/small pic, two finger spread=larger font/larger pic - I can't imagine ever going back.

Overall, I am VERY pleased with the performance of this device.  I used to 'make a decision' whether or not to 'lug' along my laptop, now I just grab the MBA.

I recommend purchasing the Ethernet/USB adapter - we all have to use Ethernet at some point ;-)

BTW - if you are looking for a carrying case - I purchased a bag from SFBags.com which is basically a sleeve, a flap, and a shoulder strap for under a hundred bucks - and it's VERY high quality.  You will want to get a size 13-2 (MBA) and a suspension strap (it has a gripper pad on it).
I bought my Airbook at the Apple Store on 5th Avenue this evening and upon opening this beauty my first thought was: "MacBook Nano"

My first thought on turning on: super screen!  I am a bright screen junkie and this screen is so much brighter than my old MacBook.

I have been a computer user for 13 years and a Mac User for about 8 or 9 and there is just something about buying a Mac that makes me giddy in a way buying a PC never did.  Apple products truly are elegant and beautiful and make work seem less so . . .

I'm glad to see that the reviews here on amazon seem to be from actual AirBook owners as opposed to those reviews I've found elsewhere that are heavily weighed down by people who don't even own it.

The biggest complaints seem to be price and lack of optical drive.

In regards to price I don't really see the issue highly portable laptops are ALWAYS priced at a premium and the similar offering on the PC side (The Sony Vaio VZ that appears to have ripped off the MacBook's keyboard design) starts @ $2,199 for a 1.2GHz processor with a Hard Drive that is only 20GB bigger.  Do I wish the AirBook was cheaper?  Sure, but I'm one of those people who will pay to shave 2 lbs. off my travel weight.

In regards to the lack of optical drive - WAHOO!  For me it was a reason to buy this AirBook.  I rarely use an optical drive these days.

I don't burn CD's anymore I use an iPod.

I don't watch DVDs anymore, I rip them in Handbrake and watch them from the hard drive.  So I can rip the movie on my iMac and transfer it via a memory card or a USB Drive.  Easy-Peasy.

99% of the software I use can be downloaded from the net so no installation CD needed.  The one program I did need was MS Office 2008 and the installation using my iMac's drive was flawless and straightforward.

As many around the 'net have stated I can't imagine this being anyone's primary computer but as a travel companion and for web-surfing, e-mail and documents Mac fans need not hesitate.

I haven't used any processor intensive programs such as Photoshop or VMWare but I don't have to: that's why I have my iMac.  I'm currently using my AB with a few Firefox windows open with several tabs, MS Excel, MS Entourage and Filemaker and all is running quite smooth.

Do I wish Mac's Ultra-portable had a 11.1 or 12.1" screen instead of 13.3" making it even lighter with a smaller footprint?  YES but I'm reviewing what IS not what I wish would be.

I actually find myself looking forward to my first business trip with this puppy because I know that will make me love this bad boy even more.

UPDATE: Since the MBA doesn't seem as slow as I feared it might be I installed Photoshop C3 and it works like a charm.  Tried to install VMWare but no dice - you need the external drive for that as VMWare doesn't recognize Remote Disc.  Another observation not only does the MBA run very quiet it runs VERY COOL - I can't remember the last time a laptop didn't burn the cr*p out of my lap!
This is them most incredible computer ever made. It puts everything else to shame. Get one, you will love it and so will your back! Remote DVD drive works great, you will hardly notice it is not in your machine. Apple has the best engineering in the computer world. It is sleek but so functional and super light. I can lay in bed and have it on my stomach and hardly notice it is there. You can bring it anywhere, read internet news on the can for that matter. It is the first true portable computer. Everything else S&*Ks in comparison now. Also it is cheap for what you get. Get one and finally go trully mobile!
Superb quality, beautiful super-bright screen with good viewing angles, doesn't get hot like most notebooks, fantastic design that slips in between documents and you don't even notice it, good battery life given the power (I average 3 1/2 hours with regular use and wireless on), light weight, fast wifi connections, tiny power adapter and great feeling full-size keyboard that is backlit for work in low lighting. This is as close to the perfect travel computer that I've ever used!

Now the not-so-greats:

- there really should have been more than one usb port. It can be handled if you need more through a small usb hub, but that's not ideal. One more port should have been included.

- Wired ethernet. Would have been nice to have that built in too, but the dongle works well and is really almost never needed for me at least. I bring a small wireless router with me anyway so I never really need to use wired ethernet. Still, it's a convenience.

- built in battery that require unscrewing many screws to replace. This is a design decision and I'm not sure I agree with it. If the battery holds up reasonably well for a year or so and it's easy to get replacement batteries, I think it's not a bad decision, but if these batteries are not good quality and don';t last it'll piss me off. I'd like the option  to bring an extra battery, but I've never done it before so even if I had the option I probably wouldn't use it. If you need to work for many hours on the plane, this is not good. On the other hand, it's just a matter of time before all airlines start having plugs for laptops in all cabins. Mixed feelings about this decision, but I love the design so much (and it would be different with a removable battery) that it feels like it outweighs this issue....not rational, but that's the way I feel.

That's it. This is the nicest laptop I've used, despite it's minor inconveniences. As long as you're aware of how you work and what you need and compare that with the macbook air's capabilities, you'll simply LOVE this machine.
Wow! is what comes to mind When I opened the box for the first time, its so shiny and it really is a piece of Art more then a simple laptop.

I found it more beautiful in person then I did on the ads, the black keyboard looks great, and again on the ad thought silver would have been better but no longer think that. Being the 1.6/80 model everyone was saying the speed will be slow...Not True! Just sold my 2.2 Macbook with 4G of ram, and this is almost the same.

The screen, it is very bright more so then the current macbook, and to me seems much clearer.
Fans run at 2400 RPMs, no noise or heat...48-57 degrees surfing and mail open.
Charges to full in 3.5 Hours.
The think that impresses me most is the built quality, I have had 6 Apple laptops this year including the Macbook Pro and lots of Macbooks, this is the best built by far.

The track pad is so precise, and much better then my macbook.
The thinness will amaze you.

I am hooked :)

UPDATE:
I was given a 1.8/64 as a gift and wrote a review, that might interest people trying to decide if the SSD drive or HHD drive is right for you

[...]
After disposing of my 1 year old, loud and hot hp nx9010, I wanted to get something that I'd keep for two or three years and not have the need to upgrade. So I settled for the PowerBook. It is so quiet that when the fan is on, its hardly noticeable. Its got a large HD (80GB); more than enough for my needs. Its a solid piece of kit. I set it up for the office network with barely any effort. 2 minutes and I was done. I'm using the standard web browser and mail app. and I figured them out without real effort. Another standard app that I've used is iSync. I used it with the Bluetooth option to get all the contacts that I had on my K700i cellphone into the AddressBook. The slight downside I've noticed is the battery time. I've managed nearly 4 hours which is less than the claimed (Apple) time. I've only had it for 6 days and Lithium Ion batteries optimise after a few recharges. Another slight complaint I have is that the PowerBook is made of aluminium and it conducts heat very well; therefore the PowerBook can get a bit warm. On hot summer days, it might not be possible/comfortable to put it on your lap. I'm looking forward to the winter months coz it'll be the swankiest hand warmer in the world. I haven't tried the DVD writer yet, so I cant tell you how good or how bad the writer is. There's so much I'm looking forward to finding out.
Stunningly beautiful and extraordinarily powerful, this laptop will impress even the most rabid Windows partisan. The screen is crisp and bright, and the 1280 x 854 resolution gives you as much room as you need.

The designers at Apple have once again outdone themselves. The keyboard contains a light sensor, which adjusts the screen brightness as ambient light changes, and also controls the keyboard backlighting. As the light dims, the keys are illuminated. When the lights go back up, the illumination turns off, and the keys go back to normal.

The 1.67 GHz processor is fast and suprisingly quiet. You'll never be left frustrated by load times.

There are a few things I wish they'd improve, however. The one-button mouse has to go! I don't know why Apple clings to this. I really wish the laptop scrollpad had two buttons instead of one; I typically use a BT500 Bluetooth mouse (which works perfectly with the Powerbook's built-in Bluetooth) to overcome this limitation. I also wish the keyboard was a bit bigger, with a dedicated row of F keys (F1, F2, etc) instead of sharing them with the computer's control keys (brightness, volume, etc). I also wish they'd move the function key to the other side; it is always in the way when I am trying to hit the Control or Option keys.

But those negatives can be completely overlooked by this spectacular machine. If you purchase this laptop, you will not be disappointed.
Why wait?  There have been problems reported with the new trackpad and noise from the 100 GB drive (which is an optional upgrade).  The trackpad is a departure from previous models and likely needs some time to shake out on the manufacturing side.  Okay, those two issues aside, this is THE laptop to own.  Let me explain.

(1) The screen is unparalled in brightness and clarity.  Apple pioneered the "widescreen" laptop, and its displays have only improved over the years. The 15.2" size is perfect for tasks that the 12" screen is too cramped to handle, and as to which the 17" is great, but adds to much weight and unwieldiness.  (It looks like they may still be having problems with the latch design on the 17" -- it just isn't an ideal solution for a laptop of this size.  But I digress ...)

(2) The speed of the system is remarkable -- noticeable even over the 1.5 gHz from last year's top of the line model.  Whips through everything, even GarageBand 2 ... which is amazing processor and memory hog. (Please, Apple, fix that ...)

(3) The illuminated keyboard (triggered by light sensors that react to the ambient light levels in the room) now is bright enough to be very practical.  Last year's model's with illuminated keyboards were pretty dim and not entirely useful. By the way, this year they've included the illuminated keyboard in both 15.2" models -- the SuperDrive and combo drive models.  Last year, it only appeared in the SuperDrive model).

(4) Fit and finish.  Unparalled -- no other laptop even comes close.  Apple has the attention to detail of Mercedes and BMW.

(5) Size. Just an inch thick, and weighs in at a bit over five pounds.  Very portable, with lots of custom cases out there in the marketplace.

(6) New technology to protect the hard drive in the event -- GASP! -- it falls. It's some patented gyroscopic doohickey, and I'm glad it's there!

I can't recommend this highly enough.
After years and years of PC use, I finally bought myself a Mac.  I waited until Apple released an update for the PB G4, and I got the 1.67 Mghz with 128 VR and 1 GB of ram and a 100 GB HD and couldn't be more happy with it.

I've been a PC user most of my life, and now that I have a Mac I am asking myself why I never switched sooner.  The OS is simple to use, so if you are wondering if it will be difficult to learn and use, think again.  It is so easy to navigate and use, and best of all, it just plain works.  No crashes, no glitches, no viruses and no freaking freeze-ups.

If you love music, photography, surfing the net or just want a computer that is easy to use and operate then please, get an Apple.  Don't listen to the Apple haters out there because there are plenty of them.  But now-a-days with all of the viruses and spyware that is plaguing the horrible 'Windows' operating system, I just don't understand why people still put of with Microsoft's crappy Windows OS.

Anyways, the price might be a little more expensive than say a Dell or a Gateways but look at the reliabitlity of owning a Mac.  If you want more of an in depth analysis of what I referring to, go check out Consumer Reports and their ratings of the Apple in comparison to PCs.  It's just a plain fact that you have way less problems with a Mac than you will with a PC and I think the initial investment totally pays for itself over time than owning a PC.

Hope I helped you out in your decision, and trust me, you will not be disapointed with a Mac purchase!
I sent back a Sony Vaio for this laptop and I am glad I did.  The laptop is physically beautiful, a great blending of form and function.  The processor is fast, I have run mutliple apps and downloads, even with just the 512 RAM, and no problems.  Wireless is great, I am using AirPort with my old Belkin transmitter and can pick up from across the house and yard.  Battery is running between 3 to 3.5 hours.  I am new to OS/X but it is easy to pick up and, I think, a better OS then XP.  A lot less virus and adware garbage to worry about.  The SuperDrive whines a litle bit when you start it up but this is really minor.  No problem with availability of software titles from what I have seen.  However, I am not a gamer, so if you are, you might want to check this out first.  I did however see a lot of game titles available for OS/X at the store.  If you are undecided between this laptop and PC's like the Vaio and Dell series, I recommend go for this one.  It is really a much better value and a very rugged, well built, physically elegent laptop.  The only question is between the 15 and 17 inch, but, I think the 15 inch is a bit more portable but I bet the 17 inch is a great laptop as well.
I think this powerbook is great. i love everything about other then the fact that it is a little slow for it's class. The backlight keyboard only stinks because it keeps me up to late in to the night. The slightly slower power for it's price doesn't really bother me because it does everything I want it to do. this is truly a go anywhere do anything laptop. Unless you don't want any scratches on it. the wide screen was awkward when i first opened it up, but after a coupe minutes I couldn't stand looking at my square emacs screen. I can't even use my friends ibook any more. Anyway the single most expensive purchase of my life and is probably the best purchase I will evn schooler make because it has helped me so much in school.
This is THE laptop. It's fast, it's beautiful, and it's well built. I have never, EVER used a laptop this amazing, EVER. Unlike other PC laptops, this one had no parts that can break off or get stuck, such as flaps to cover ports, the media tray, and others. The backlit keyboard is handy in the dark, and the sensors that adjust the brightness of the display and keyboard is a true marvel. And it's FAST, faster than my PC running at 1.8ghz. Word launches in under 10 seconds, as does any other application I throw at it. And the operating system is lightyears ahead of anything on the other side of the fence, whether it is what they currently offer or are trying to create.

The only gripe I have is that the laptop gets dirty easily, and when you have something this cool, you'll want to show it off in it's clean state.
I got my powerbook just last week and I thought I had to upgrade with Mac.com from OS 10.3 to 10.4. But surprisingly, it came with 10.4 Tiger in the machine already. The only thing makes me nervous is the battery gets really hot after awhile. It actually burns my laps. I did check with the serial numbers on Mac.com to see if mine is one of those defected batteries, but it is not. Am wonder if any users out there are experiencing the same 'heat' issue?
Being a technician on many products, I've come to learn that computers are tools. I came to work on Apple products through the years but recently my job functions required more hands on use of the G4. Mac Office 2004, which you have to buy on the side doesn't have a good ODBC plugin that makes it hard for people in finance to do their job. That is unless you buy a third party plugin for Office. Some of the features loaded on OS X are not fully developed and seem to be added just so they can add it to the ever-growing list of features. I'd say the top programs I use are Terminal, iTunes, iPhoto, Adium, Photoshop, Dreamweaver, and Quicksilver.

I'm sure I can get a lot of Mac enthusiasts to argue against me and flame me in every way possible. That's the beauty of this system; you actually have a fan base that most other systems don't. It's fairly easy to adapt to this operating system and hardware if you have patience. I think the nicest thing about this laptop is the DVD-RW that comes with it, Apple calls it a "Superdrive." Although you'd probably be recommended to buy Roxio's Toast program to burn cds. All in all you have to be ready to fork out some money when you switch.

Personally I love the G4, I have distanced myself enough to be very critical on some items but this is one product that doesn't have much criticism. Of course that is compared to almost every other system out there. They've embedded FreeBSD into the OS perfectly and makes it sound for developers to use and compile software. I do hope that in the future Apple fixes a lot of the minor glitches and becomes mainstream because this product is a very valuable tool.
I was a confirmed PC-bigot since DOS3.1 and made the switch evetually after increased frustration with Windows led to several failed attempts to move to Linux.

My only chance to try a new OS was to buy new Hardware.

A year on I'm not disappointed.  OSX is the best of UNIX under the covers with a GUI that's sweeter than anything MS could dream of.  The bundled apps have enabled a novice like me to prepare printed books of photos, make DVDs of my photos and home movies and even dabble in making a little music with Garageband.

But it's not just about media...MS Office for the Mac blows the socks of the PC version in power and beauty.  Apple ship the development tools CD with the mac as well, so for a programmer, I can get started right away coding lovely mac apps (in ObjectiveC), as well as C, C++, Python, Ruby and Java, all of which ship pre-installed.

As far as the hardware (this specific PB) is concerned, the machine is lovely to look at, ludicrously fast to wake from sleep, and the only times I've rebooted it in the last year are when the automatic software update system suggests I reboot after an OS upgrade.  I can even swap batteries while the machine is on and running.  The backlit keyboard and superdrive are extras I wasn't sure I would need, but I'm damn glad I paid for.

Do it.  Do it now.  I guarantee you won't be disappointed.
Apple needs to improve quality control and product support. The superdrive stopped working when laptop was 6 weeks old.  Sent to Apple repair on April 4 and was informed 5 days later after I called that replacement wouldn't be available until end of April. New Superdrive could be quality control problem like permanent white spots on screens and batteries that catch fire of earlier models. Pity, because everything else about the machine is simply superb.
Had to return an hp laptop because it refused to cooperate.  ProTools Le was too much for it.

I didn't want a powerbook, I needed one.

The blend of beauty and pleasure shocked me when I booted it up the first time.

Slipped in the gig of pc 2700 ram with no problems.

It hasn't complained once.

The superdrive is super-intuitive and easily backed up a full dvd in as much time as my pc would burn files to cd-r.

All my peripherals are compatible with osx. 3.8 (which I had to download from apple...breezy.)

I'm enjoying the interface, a lot less clicks and menus to access files.

Got giggly about the zoom feature for the display.

When's the last time your pc made you smile?

In short, my g4 is the perfect houseguest.
This is one of the best notebook PC's on the market. This has a 1.67GHz PowerPC G4 Processor which isn't too fast but it's pretty fast for the Apple computers. 512 MB RAM is just perfect but I would recommend 1GB or 2GB. 80 Gigabyte Hard Drive is really nice and it's almost the largest hard drive (100GB is the largest). It has a SuperDrive which can do whatever you want it to do. The styling on this notebook is no wonderful and comes with all the ports and features. 15.2" is pure beauty and the graphics on this thing are great. Here are the specifications of this laptop.

I have Powerbook G4, purchased Nov 04, Mac OSX 10.3.8, 1.5 Ghz, upgraded RAM to 768MB.

If you're new to computing, or use Mac for non-business applications (heavy on graphics and creative work) it's probably a good choice.  If you use Outlook (not Express) heavily, or use Powerpoint, Excel, and Word a lot and like XP, then the Mac is a snoozer.

reasons not to buy:

1-you pay a lot to get it to do the things a PC with updated Microsoft Office Professional Suite already does, and it never is quite as good...Mac Powerpoint feels pokier (saving, just in keeping up with my typing), Mac Excel toolbar gets on top of/in the way of my worksheets (haven't figured out how to make it go to the back), Outlook just isn't replicated at all on the Mac (unless you get Virtual PC)...Entourage just lacks the functionality

2-doesn't seem to handle the WEP password protocol on my Linksys wireless home network...even the folks at the Apple store said I wouldn't be able to get the DHCP security to work with my PC-based home network

3-Filevault....oooh, what a liability.  Much touted file encryption will scramble and destroy files that are open if the Mac also goes into the won't-wake-up-again-sleep mode problem that it has.  Though I never diagnosed this completely, I lost a number of key working files that may have been open when the Mac went into sleep mode (read:  crashed) while I had Filevault going.  I lost saved versions, and they're completely unrecoverable.  Later the guys in the Apple store said they never use Filevault...it's "scary", they said.

4-Certain applications, like Visual Basic, aren't available for the Mac yet.

5-switching cost is high...getting contacts and files migrated over to the Powerbook took me a long time, and some of it is never the same. The contacts from outlook to entourage aren't organized the same (due to the fact that entourage contacts aren't as full-featured, lack some key fields), and the pc directories are only useful as read-only...I can't edit files in my pc folders and save them back into those folders (must have been some drive formatting issue that carried over); ripple effect of switching means you have to buy a lot of stuff new (back up drives, antivirus software, disk management software, backup AC cables, if you travel, etc.)

6-if you like XP, the Mac is NOT intuitive.  What used to be left is now right, what's top is now bottom.  I keep my mouse to the right of the screen (out of the way of typing)...but now important buttons like close/minimize are on the left, increasing mouse travel time.  PC's usually have a disk drive light that lets you know the PC is working on something that involves the drive.  I liked that...very intuitive way to let me know the PC is busy.  No such light on the Mac.

7-you may have problems listening to Sirius radio on Safari; I needed to use Internet Explorer (Hah!  much touted Mac browser useless for audio?), and even then can't get fully functional display due to some Mac technicality, according to Sirius techs.

reasons to buy:

1-Largely virus-free because virus writers get more leverage attacking pc's (more market penetration and more business focused); this is a blessing because I found Norton AV '04 to be dysfunctional, glad not to have to deal with it anymore.

2-Supposedly faster processing due to more streamlined operating system, though I don't find the mac to be any more responsive than even a lower priced pc

3-Faster boot-up and shutdown.

4-Fewer crashes-true, though not infallible either; mac's version of the PC blue screen is that some won't wake up after going to sleep

5-cool keyboard, backlit in the dark; very romantic and pretty.

Rating of 3 stars indicates sameness...it's as good as a PC, just different.  I wouldn't recommend it for someone who's switching from XP expecting something superior.
Beautiful looking machine built in China is fatally flawed.

The front and side edges of the machine are very sharp.  Even sharper than the paint chipped edges of my 550 TiBook.  The front edge will cut into your wrists.  Typing with the machine on your lap is painful.  Anytime your elbows are below your hands the edges will be there digging into the same spots on your wrists.  Eventually your hands will loose circulation.  Prior Apple Powerbook designers understood that sharp edges are bad.  The screen frame perimeters were concave to fit with convex typing surface edges.  Not so on recent models.  This one is the worst ever for wrist pain.  Will make you yearn for the smooth curves of the original "toilet seat" iBook or Wallstreet.

The cool new two finger track pad scroll trick doesn't work with OS9 applications running under classic.

This machine is sold with CLASSIC OS9, it must be installed from the included DVD.  You can use your old software, saving money, and saving time learning new software.  OSX Safari browser does not properly recogonize downloaded file's extensions.  It is incapable of assigning creator and type settings based on extension.  This is a minor annoyance, effectively eliminating user ability to double click downloaded data file for program launch.  Files must be opened from applicaitons' file menus.

This Powerbook has feature that automatically sets screen brightness according to ambient room lighting.  Sounds good but it is poorly implemented.  The screen will constantly flicker, adjusting brightness with every hand movement (typing) over the keyboard.  Apparently the programmers weren't bright enough to average ambient light levels over time instead of using instantaneous readings.  I immediately disabled this "feature".

The machine spins the "rattle trap" optical drive every time it wakes from sleep.  This flaw has been in the Apple OS since the introduction of optical drives.  Why the machine can't remember if there is disk in the drive during sleep is beyond me.  It happens even if there is no disk in the drive!  Short of removing the DVD drive there is no way to turn off this annoying "feature" (bug).

The keyboard isn't as nice as the keyboards found on previous Powerbooks.  The keys require more pressure, provide less tactile feedback, and little audible feedback.

OSX uses grayscaled anti alias rendered fonts everywhere.  Fonts are now harder to read than ever before, 8 and 9 point fonts look terrible.  This makes the screen appear fuzzy.  I've looked but haven't figured out how to disable this annoying flaw.

If you want a Macintosh laptop this is the one to get.  Just don't expect it to be perfect or even confortable for typing....
First of all, let me state that while I have used this machine, I am the current owner of an older model - the first generation 17" with a 1GHz processor and a 60GB hard drive.

One of the biggest questions I always hear is "Isn't that too big to carry around?" My answer is no. I carry it for a 20 minute walk to my college campus daily and have no problems with it. I keep it in a Brenthaven bag specifically designed for it, and while it is a little unwieldy, it took me very little time to get used to it. The weight is definitely not an issue. For anyone thinking about getting this, I would weigh any bag that you carry with you on a day to day basis - seven pounds really isn't so much to deal with.

I use my Powerbook as my primary machine. At any given time, I am usually running Adobe Photoshop and/or Illustrator, Macromedia Flash, as well as a few native applications (Mail and iCal are always open, usually iTunes as well). The programs that come with the computer are well integrated into the operating system. I use mine for about 15 hours a day, and I put it to sleep rather than shutting it down. Even with all of the work that I do on it, a year and a half after purchasing my model it still stays on for two to three weeks with no need to shut it down.

The backlit keyboard is a feature that I never thought I would need, but now that I have it I'm not sure how I ever lived without it. Light sensors automatically adjust your screen brightness and keyboard lighting, although these can be adjusted manually. It makes working a breeze. Even though I don't look at the keyboard very much when I'm typing, it's nice to be able to see when I need to use keys I don't access very often (function keys, etc.). Since the keyboard lighting controls take up extra function keys, the "one-key" Expose features in OSX require one more step with pressing function before hitting F9-F11, but if it poses a real problem you can always set screen corners or change the hot key.

My biggest issue with this computer is the battery life. With the brightness turned all the way down (which can make the screen very difficult to see depending on your lighting conditions) and AirPort turned off, it can get around 3.5-4 hours of battery life. If you need full brightness and a wireless internet connection, you're realistically looking at about 2-2.5 hours of battery life.

Overall, I am a large supporter of this computer. I would recommend it to anyone that has a need for a Macintosh with maximum screen size and portability.
Apple's latest update to their aluminum PowerBook series warrants a close look by current PowerBook users and anyone on the fence. The 17" screen is stunning, even keeping in mind that other makers have copied the idea (Apple's overall presentation simply outclasses the copycats' efforts), and the design and construction are first class.

I purchased the new 17" PowerBook to replace the previous 15" model. The increase in processor speed is noticeable, and I love the new trackpad which incorporates vertical and horizontal scrolling simply by touching the pad with two fingers instead of one. It is immediately easy to use--no extra buttons to manipulate or odd procedures to learn. The screen seems brighter than the previous one, and the new keyboard backlighting is beautiful.

I also like the fact that, besides increasing the base amount of memory, Apple now ships the machines with one memory slot open. That is, a standard 512MB machine has one 512MB strip on board, with one slot open. I simply took the "extra" 512MB strip out of my previous machine and put it in the new one, giving me a full 1GB of memory (upgradable to 2GB for those planning missions beyond the galaxy or whatever).

Buyers of the new 17" PowerBook should also check out the Apple/Brenthaven shoulder bag and backpack. I opted for the backpack this time. It is beautifully crafted; easily worth the slight additional cost over the standard fare, especially since the computer sleeve is made specifically for this computer.

In sum, this is not an "intermediate" tweak; it is a serious upgrade of an already-great product.
I was on the fence for so long when it came to deciding on a laptop.  Used, new, refurbished?  I went with new, [...]

i love the backlit keybard.  the "m" key looks like an inverted "w" because of the unsual font on the keyboard letters.  This machine is super fast.  I have already encoded 2/3 of my cd collection with itunes 6.  It didn't take but a couple of hrs to encode 65 cds.

I, too, wish the screen went back a bit more for contorted computing but it should go back enough for most people.

This is my first date with os X so I am still trying to learn all the extensions like dmg, gz, tgz, and all that unixy stuff.  But the system seems very stable running with a gig of ram.  I have the 2.0ghz model.

The 2finger scolling feature (for horiz and vertical) on the trackpad is an awesome innovation.  I do wish the trackpad prefs included sensitivity adjustment capability to go along with the speed.

Yes, the machine does get warm to hot but not dangerously so and it also depends on how long you use and what you are doing.  I use a sweatshirt on my lap if I use it on my lap.

The camera which is built in is a nice touch, but i never use a webcam.  I do wonder, however, if someone on the wireless network can look at me remotely with this thing.  The reason I wonder is because it was so effortless to connect to the internet and when clicking on the airport icon, I see all kind of strange name and router device names, some with email addys.  I don't even know if I am gaining or sharing access to the internet thru my wireless dsl modem or from someone elses but my surfing speed and download speed are lightning fast.  The imovie hd update took about a minute and a half to download wirelessly (a 52Mb file).

Well, I am overall impressed with the machine and even more impressed that I knuckled down the cash to get it.  It comes very well stocked with software so you save a ton right there.  And, I know the are plenty of nice pc laptops for a fraction of the price out there but I have been a mac user my whole life.  I am greatful for not having to suffer the bumpy transition of early os X incarnations.  Tiger seems to on the right track but i do miss the quaintness of pre os X systems.  I feel more grown up using this new system.

The mag plug for power is another great innovation.  I don't intend on testing its limits ;) but I am confident it will do its job if I ever get careless after a night of heavy drinking.  ;)

For most mac users this would be a great step up from whatever you owned prior especially when you compare to older laptop models.  5 stars is my personal opinion.  If you decide to invest in one of these macbooks, I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoy mine.  Happy 30th,  APPLE!
Best laptop I have ever owned.  Switched from an IBM t42 to this baby. Wow, and I really loved my t42. Its really fast except some apps take some time to startup but i assume those are the apps that are using roseta.  I have read about lots of problems people had with whining noise, and crackling speakers.  I have not had any of those issues.  I did notice the speakers crack when the volume was cranked up all the way a couple of times.  I also don't like that the lcd does not fold back more.  I like to sit in a bean bag and do work and the angle can be weird not being able to fold the screen back more.  It also seems to get hotter then my t42 but not like my old dell that i thought would burn my legs.
I had pretty high expectations for the MacBook Pro, and yet it still exceeded them. This is the finest computer, laptop or tower, that I have ever used. The Core Duo processor and faster bus really do make the MB Pro dramatically faster than the Powerbook G4s. Even mundane tasks like surfing the web are noticibly quicker. Front Row is a great multi-media browser and runs like a dream on Apple's latest laptop. Seemingly a small feature, the Mag-Safe power cord is actually very useful. Have already accidently caught the cord on something a few times and had it fall safely away from the MB Pro.

Had heard complaints of irritating noise from earlier buyers, but haven't experienced that problem with my MB Pro. The only complaint I really have is the lack of Universal applications right now. Programs run so much faster natively on the MB Pro than in emulation through Rosetta. By the end of the year, however, pretty much every current app should be Universal.
After the hype of the Keynote in San Francisco in January, I decided to finally take the plunge and revisit the world of apple after an absentia of >20 years. Yes, my last apple was a 48kb IIE.

So here is my mini-review after 1 week of use.

Packaging and Aesthetics : Excellent, light weight, fantastic build quality.

LCD Display: Nice, but not as nice as the Fujitsu/Sony's

OS: Very nice OS compared to windows XP. Easy to use. But one big caveat. I am surprised that OS X took up so much space! Found a 2GB folder with nothing but printer drivers. iWorks is 2GB NB MS office is only 561 MB. On a fresh MBP, almost 20 GB of harddisk spaced used at the outset....So for all those who think Windows is bloatware think again. OS X might be worse in this respect.

Battery life: Average 3hrs of use. 2hrs + if playing a DVD.

Features:

Pros: iSight built in. Magsafe to prevent my 4 year old from tripping. Remote control!

Cons:where is the FW 800, Dual layer burner and my modem!

Performance: Fast with optimized universal binary software.

Packaged software:

Pros:iLife 06- Great!,Front Row- Fantastic, Dashboard!

cons: should have bundled iworks for free rather than just a trial.

Software availablity: Most stuff that you do on a PC is available. One big hole is in the games dept though.

Overall, my conversion to the Macworld has been an easy one although I have to admit I won't be throwing away my PC as the workplace remains PC only.

Conclusion: A solid 4.5 Stars
I received my stock MacBook Pro with 2.0GHz Intel Core Duo processor and 100GB hard drive last night, and this thing has completely blown me away. It is extremely fast, and that is not an overstatement in any way.

I also love the build quality, iSight camera, lit keyboard and the "wide" trackpad, which perfectly matches the wide screen. Not to mention it is extremely silent; all I can hear is the hard drive, and I haven't yet noticed the fans, even with playing Unreal Tournament 2004 at 1600x1200 (hooked up an external Dell display). It should also handle Doom 3 well, so I will test that once I get my hands on a copy. It seems like this thing is even a good gaming machine because it comes with a very good graphics card.

All that being said, I am not a gamer, but I do enjoy playing games occasionally, so it is important to me that I can do that well.
Before I begin this review I'd like you the reader to know that this is my first Mac - I've been set free from the PC world for the most part now and it is awesome!  I brag to my co-workers about how nice it is to use the MAC OS over Windows.  I can see now what everyone before me has talked about in their reviews of Apple's computers.  It take a little patience to learn the Apple OS, but in no more than one week you should be feeling confident while moving around in the Apple world.

The MacBook Pro has essentially everything you could want in one, well-designed package.  To say this is a really great computer is an understatement.  I highly recommend it.  I enjoy all the little additions that apple has put into it the design that make it so user friendly.

Major features of this computer are the illuminated keyboard, the built-in iSight camera (which is really fun especially with kids), built-in Bluetooth, and its ultra-sharp LCD screen make it very attractive to someone looking to buy a new computer.  I am also amazed at how slim it is, especially when you consider how much it has inside it.  When it's connected to my Logitech 2.1 speaker system, I find that the sound quality I get when using iTunes is outstanding!

There are two areas of improvement that I am eager to see overcome.  One is that I wish there was more available native software that works on the Intel-native MacBook Pro.  I've been reading that there are software companies working on updating/revising their products to work on the new system so I don't really see this as being a long-term problem, rather just a minor annoyance (all the old software works, but the speed is much slower than when using a native Intel app).  Second observation is this machine can get very hot.  I had to buy a notebook-cooling pad so it doesn't overheat.  I have a ThinkPad I use for work (not by choice), and when comparing the heat it generates compared with the MacBook Pro I realize how hot the MacBook Pro can get compared to other computers.

In the end, I looked at a lot of other computers and decided to get this one.  I am glad I did.
It's the most stunning idea, isn't it?  This top of the line MacBook Pro is the fastest Mac Notebook ever, and probably one of the fastest Macs period.

When Steve Jobs announced the new Macs, with Intel Core Duo processors I was almost certain I wanted to buy one. Why? Macs are well known for ease of use and capabilities, but they have managed all that for years, with processors that are not always top-notch. That all changed in January 2006.

Processor in the new MacBook Pro

The Intel Core Duo processor in the new MacBook Pro is an amazing chip. What have I noticed about the speed of the machine featuring this chip? It is incredibly fast. You'd be surprised by how much faster even web browsing is, when you have a processor as powerful as the Core Duo. However, what I've really been impressed by is doing things such as video encoding. I've encoded videos in H264 as much as eight times faster than my Powerbook G4. Furthermore, the iLife applications that are included on the MacBook Pro fly, with the speed. iPhoto, iMovie, iDVD, and Garageband perform like never before. I've really been impressed by the speed.

The Core Duo is a great processor. It offers exceptional desktop PC performance, in a design that can fit in small computers and notebooks. It features two cores on a single die, which effectively gives you the performance of two processors. Don't let the 2 GHZ clock speed fool you. This Core Duo Chip will outperform 3+ GHZ Pentium 4 processors. It really is an amazing breakthrough, from Intel.

Video Card

The new MacBook Pro 2 GHZ model features an ATI Radeon X1600 graphics processor using PCI Express 256 MB of GDDR3 video memory. This is the best graphic card Apple has *ever* included in a notebook. This graphic processor will work well for most gaming, and it is great for viewing back complex H264 movies, including high definition videos. You can enjoy high definition H264 videos, without drop frames.

Ports -

The MacBook Pro features 2 USB 2.0 ports, 1 Firewire 400 port, Gigabit Ethernet, audio in/out, and Expresscard (34 slot).

Display - Apple touts the display on the new MacBook Pro as bright as the cinema displays, and there is no question: these displays are bright!  Depending on your lighting condition, you'll almost certainly not turn the display to full brightness.  I had to turn down the brightness, for it was hard on my eyes. However, it is nice to know the brightness is there, when needed.  The native resolution is 1440x900 giving you plenty of screen real estate, to keep the applications you need visible.

Video out - The new MacBook Pro has a DVI video output.  An adapter is also included to output VGA.  There is an optional adapter available to output S-Video and composite video.  Furthermore, the DVI video out supports up to a 30-inch Apple Cinema Display (or other comparable display).  This gives you great possibilities.  You can easily use your MacBook Pro on the road, but plug it into a keyboard, mouse, and huge display, when at your desk.  The perfect all around system.

Memory - This Mac is a powerhouse and 1 GB of memory (thats included) will get you started nicely.  However, you may consider adding even more memory at some point.  The MacBook Pro supports up to 2 GB of memory. It uses PC5300 DDR2 - SODIMM modules.

Applications -

Apple includes iLife '06, which has iPhoto, iMovie, iWeb, iDVD, and Garageband. There is the Safari web browser, the always useful iCal, AddressBook, iChat, etc. Overall, I was pleased with the included software.

iLife 06 is particularly great. I love the new full-screen photo editing, photo comparing, etc. You can now also order calendars and greeting cards made with your photos, direct from Apple, by using the iPhoto software. iMovie has new themes, which helps make professional-looking home movies, and iDVD now supports widescreen DVDs. iWeb is a brand-new applications, which makes it easy to create professional quality webpages, quickly. I can't wait to rebuild by site using iWeb. Apple continues to make it easy to create music, manage your digital images, make movies, and create web sites.

A trial (30 day) of iWork '06 is also included, which includes the page layout program Pages, and the presentation program Keynote (which makes presentations that blow away presentations made by rival Powerpoint).

Hard Drive -

This model of the MacBook Pro includes a 100 GB 5400 RPM hard drive. This is going to be sufficient for most people to hold their photographs, music, and some videos. However, others will need more space, so you can always use an external drive, when at your desk. It is also important that you remember to backup your important files to either another external hard drive, or DVDs. I only point this out because today with great machines like the MacBook Pro we're storing more of our great memories on computers than ever before, so make sure you don't lose them, if something happens to your machine. Apple includes a great backup program called Backup 3, if you subscribe to the .mac service. I use it all the time, and it simple interface helps me keep peace of mind.

Superdrive-

The optical drive included with the new MacBook Pro allows you to watch DVDs, listen to music, burn DVDs, and burn CDs. It is a slot-loading drive, so the disks slide magically in and out of the computer's right side. There are no drawers to break off.  Note - The drive does *not* burn dual layer DVDs.

Front Row Experience - Apple has included a new software title that at this time is only available on the iMac, Mac Mini, and MacBook Pro. Front Row. Front Row comes with your MacBook Pro, and a remote control is also included. Front row allows you to watch and listen to media items, on your computer, from across the room. Click one button on the remote, and bring up Front Row, for quick access to your music, movies, podcasts, DVD, and more. I like this feature, but I wonder how useful it is, since I'm usually sitting right in front of the computer and can just use a mouse, to access this content.

PowerPC Applications on Intel Machine

If you own a lot of software for Mac, then most of it is probably compiled for PowerPC. Developers are working hard to make titles run natively on both Intel and PowerPC, but many titles are not yet ready. However, many titles you can use on an Intel Mac because Apple has included Rosetta, which translates the PowerPC code into something the Intel machine can read. However, you never see Rosetta for it works quietly in the background and makes running PowerPC applications seamless. Microsoft Office, for example, works perfect under Rosetta. Intensive applications such as Photoshop will run under Rosetta, but it will be slower until Adobe has an Intel compiled version of Photoshop. Rosetta does work and if you add memory to your iMac, you may find such application somewhat equal to how it would perform on a 1GHZ PowerPC G4, from my experience.

Two titles I use EyeTV and Toast 7 are not yet compiled for Intel, but they run fine on my Intel Mac, under Rosetta. Again, you don't have to open anything special to use Rosetta. Your Mac knows when it needs it and uses it.

Wireless- The MacBook Pro can still connect wirelessly to networks using its included Airport Card. Furthermore, it features a Bluetooth module to connect wirelessly to devices.

Design - This MacBook Pro is beautiful, and you notice the quality as soon as you begin to open the box. It is packaged with care, in beautiful packaging. The MacBook Pro is thin, and the display is beautiful.  The Mag Safe Power Connector is another amazing design feature on this machine.  If someone or something pulls on the power cord connected to your notebook, instead of the notebook flying, the magnet on the connector releases, leaving your MacBook Pro safe.

Overall, I am very excited about the MacBook Pro.  It is incredibly fast on Intel-native applications, and it does a very good job running PowerPC applications. If you're upgrading from a G4 Mac like myself, this machine will seem to fly. If you're upgrading from a G5 based Mac, it will be faster on native applications, but the increase in performance will be less significant to you. The Intel machines are the future of Apple, so there is no question this is a good machine, and it is powerful enough to be a good computer, for quite some time. I'm happy with my purchase, and I look forward to continue exploring my Intel Mac in the coming days
This is more of a comment than a review. I'm considering buying my first Mac (a MB Pro) but what blows me away about all the reviews here is that while most previous Mac owners say hold off for the next generation it's the 'windows switch-overs' who seem to be most blown away by the Mac books. They seem overwhelmed by the experience. Tells me all the more that I need to jump ship too from my miserable existance in Windows-land although I may wait for the next generation for some of the macbook kinks to be worked out...
I have used Macs off and on for many years, but I have exclusively owned PC's only. Since Mac's switch to the Intel processor, it was easy to justify the price of Macs, as now native programs (programs for Macs) work far faster than the old PowerPC processors. Besides that, for those of you who don't want to turn exclusively to Macs, there is the dual boot mode to run Windows. Be prepared for lots of issues on that though. There is still a lot of un-updated applications, and things will run SLOWER than on a normal Windows PC. Things should improve after updates, but this will take time.

This is not the notebook for you if you are a hardcore PC gamer. The support is a long ways off for that. I am a PC gamer, but I have a PC exclusively for that. This is the notebook for you if you want to be able to run all the native Mac apps and run them fast, all conveniently ready to go where ever you are.

Battery life is ok. for having a Dual Core processor, it lasted longer than I though at about 2 1/2 hrs. on non-battery save mode (less if running more intensive programs). Heat is hot. I am a lefty and using the touchpad on the left-hand side, it gets hot. Also, don't ever put this on your lap, even for casual use (temps usually in the 60C - 70C range). Weight is a a bit heavy, but that is to be expected for the screen size of the Notebook. Size is excellent. Very thin for what it packs in it!

One bad "improvement" is the power plug. It attaches through magnets instead of plugging into the notebook. This is great if you happen to trip a lot over your wires, but for most of us out there who don't have that issue, it is a pain! I use this notebook a lot on non-flat areas, and it constantly unplugs. The smallest unstraightening of the plug will make it not be able to charge (it can still be crookedly connected and not charge).

One great thing about the Macbook Pro that I love is in order to right click, all I have to do is press the touchpad with two fingers. This is very convenient and allows me to be as lazy as clicking a PC's right click button. It becomes very natural.

So basically, get this notebook if you want to run native apps like Final Cut, and run them portably.

Don't get this notebook if you want to run Windows on it (wait for more support on Intel Macs), or if you are a PC gamer wanting to run PC games through Windows on the Mac.

As for me, I am overall happy with my purchase. I got it for native Mac apps.
We've gone through two of these already, and both have had significant problems. I'll give an update when we get our third. In addition to the oft-cited heat issues, they often don't come out of sleep properly, requiring a hard reset.

It seems that Apple rushed these initial Intel-based laptops to get them on the market. It's probaly best to wait until the next generation ones come out either later this year or early next. For one, the next gen models will use the Core 2 processors, which are phenomenal and will reduce power consumption while giving an almost 100% boost to speed. Second, more applications will have been ported to the Intel architecture by then.

Unless you absolutely have to have an intel Mac now, I'd recommend waiting for the second generation laptops. Otherwise, you're going with a first generation chip on a first generation laptop. It's not surprising that so many people are having problems.
Very nice package and value. Didn't get 5 stars because HD could be larger and faster. Most people that buy Macs do it for video / photo editing. And it eats lots of disc space! Could use even a 250Gb drive!
this is an apple marvel! Keyboard is the best I have ever used on any computer.  The heat that everyone mentions is not an issue for me.  The glossy screen is vivid and really makes the images come alive with brilliant clarity and color.  The last notebook I had was a 14" ibook. This computer is so much thinner and easier to transport.  For the extra money this is a much sexier machine than the macbook.
This is the finest Laptop I have had the pleasure to own.  I have owned HP, Sony, KDS and IBM. None of these are close in quality to the MAC. Some folks have complained about the fan noise...I can't hear my fan run.  The unit runs a little warmer than I would like but is much cooler than the Sony Vaio it replaced.  We have 5 computers on our wireless network 2 Macs and 3 PC's.  We will replace one of the PC's soon with another MAC.....Buy ANY Mac...you will not regret it.
David, get a card reader. That one will not olny read PCMCIA, but also compact flash and a half dozen other formats.

Noise? Dorje, you abviously never had a PC Laptop. Macs are the most quiet computers you can get anywhere, the new MacBook pro included. You hear the grass grow, Dorje...

Speed: check-out the real-time effects in iMove, everything is FLUID. Run Aperture on an Intel Mac? Amazing!

As for non-universal applications; it was very well known that they would run slow: if you want to blame someone, blame Adobe who hasn't followed Apple's guidelines for programing (using Xcode) and now faces a big challenge porting the applications to an intel compatible version. Or be honest and admit that you didn't do your homework in research, before you jumped on the all new MacBook Pro... Besides, I had one of the very first ones. Since I loaded the available FIRMWARE UPDATES, my PPC Apps run much, much faster and they don't slow down my native environment anymore at all.
I've been running on Apple laptops for the past couple years, so it seemed natural to grab one of these as an upgrade.

Let me start by saying it is a quality piece of hardware. My 15" unit has the same screen resolution as my old 17" G4, and is a great *potential* upgrade for 17" users tired of carrying an aircraft carrier sized laptop.

To better understand my 3 star rating, let me preface by saying that I'm an amateur photographer. So a couple key elements for me are being able to import and process my photographs.

The first gotcha -- no PCMCIA slot. Maybe the little slot they've put into my 15" model is a technical step up, but that doesn't help me be more productive with all me existing gear. Sure I can import directly from the camera, but I don't always want to have to drag it out and drain its battery. I often have several compact flash cards with pictures in them and shuttling them back into the camera is cumbersome. To me this was a real mess up on Apple's part. Many of us have large investments in PCMCIA hardware (microdrives, compact flash etc) and to arbitrarily muck that up seems like old school Apple arrogance.

Second gotcha, no Intel native version of Adobe Photoshop and while the PPC version runs, it suffers *terribly* in performance. Add to that that I've seen issues with minor file corruption when saving files from Nikon raw to JPG and its very clear that until the native version of Photoshop comes out, Intel Apples are crippled for anyone wanting professional level image editing.

My 15" MBP doesn't get uncomfortably hot while running, but the upper left hand corner warms up considerably while running all the old (PowerPC) applications.

Will I get rid of my 15" MBP? No. Would I recommend it to others, yes but with caveats. Think about what it is you need this machine to do for you. If you need a high performance application that hasn't been ported to the Intel version of the operating system, then stay away. If you're a typical office user who gets email, surfs and might use the built in video and picture programs then it will be ok for you.
The Mac OS is a reasonably good unix-like operating system, especially for everyday and multimedia use. There are things about it that will irritate users coming from an operating system like FreeBSD. gcc, a critically important tool in any self respecting unix environment, is strangely absent even as an installation time option. This is fine for users that install only binary applications, but programmers and system administrators coming from other unix systems won't be able to live with it for very long. You can get gcc on your system if you download Xcode, but you have to sign up for a (free) Apple developer membership.

As far as the hardware goes, there's a lot of FUD going around about the switch to Intel processors. It is true that the Intel processors have higher clock rates, but just as horsepower is only the definitive measure of a car to the uninformed, so too is the clock rate of a processor in a computer. The Intel architecture has some key disadvantages when compared to powerpc. One of the obvious ones is the register set. Registers are small, extremely fast memory for a processor. The 32 bit x86 architecture has 8 32 bit registers that are used as general purpose along with a few special purpose registers. The 32 bit powerpc implementation architechture features 32 general purpose registers, also 32 bit, as well as 32 64 bit floating point registers, in addition to a set of special purpose registers. Why is this important? Because in the register starved x86 architecture, there is more dependence on operations on the slower RAM. With the powerpc architecture, the programmer can load values into registers, manipulate the contents of those registers as necessary, and store the results back in memory. This is one reason why a "slower" powerpc will have better performance than a "faster" intel. Of course, since the intel processors have higher clock rates, you can concoct tests that will favor them, but these have little bearing on reality. The Intel strategy for at least the past ten years has been to increase the clock rate steadily and not really improve the architecture.
If you're considering buying a MacBook pro consider exactly what type of user you are, power, casual, gamer, wordprocessor, etc. before stepping into this product. What you get from the feature reviews is a lot about system specifications, which will help you determine if the machine is cutting edge enough for you, but might not necessarily help you determine if the MBP will fit as nicely as your favorite pair of shoes.

I believe the system specs were covered in the feature reviews, or you can just go to Apple's website and pull down the same information, so let me try and cover what hasn't been covered yet.

If you are like me, and hate carrying around a heavy piece of equipment from place to place, the MBP is a good option. It is very portable, at just over five pounds, it is a great choice for a user who is always on the move. Even with the battery pack in the case I find myself not complaining about the weight.

However, this portability does have a draw back - in creating a compact notebook the components are very close together and the mechanisms for maintaining cool temperatures inside the MBP are not quite up to par. Anyone who has actually used a MBP for more than an hour will tell you that even during normal operation it gets very warm to the touch, and sometimes too hot to use comfortably. If you are the type of person who likes to use a laptop on the lap or to type for long periods of time directly on the device, the MBP might not be for you. Because the case is metal it acts as something of a heat-sink, meaning that the entire device will eventually get warm, if not very hot. This is by far the biggest drawback of the MBP. If the device was always cool to the touch and you could set it on your lap I would have given it 5 stars, but alas, such is not the case.

If you are like me and will be using the MBP as a primary device at a desk or workstation, I highly suggest buying a secondary keyboard and a mouse for it. You will find yourself getting very uncomfortable with the heat if you don't.

Secondly, in response to what other users have said about the MBP not seeming as fast as other macs, I would say that this is true only initially before apple's programs are converted to Universal Binary (a code which can be run natively on the Core Duo). Applications which run on the MBP or any apple with an Intel chip and are not marked by the Universal logo, run under a seamlessly integrated program called Rosetta. Because Rosetta as to translate the application into a code that Intel processor can understand some of the "speed" is lost. However, with a little patience Apple will role out more UB apps in the future, thereby taking advantage of the MBP. I was running one of Apple's most robust programs "Aperture" on my MBP flawlessly.

In closing, I just want to say that my biggest suggestion to people is to consider the heat issue and consider how you use the computer. If you're looking for a true lap "laptop," I'd look elsewhere (or at the plastic covered MacBook). If you're looking for a mobile powerhouse pick up the MBP.
About my Mac:

  Machine Name: MacBook Pro 15"
  Machine Model: MacBookPro1,1
  CPU Type: Intel Core Duo
  Number Of Cores: 2
  CPU Speed: 2 GHz
  L2 Cache (shared): 2 MB
  Memory: 2 GB
  Bus Speed: 667 MHz

I own it since 2 months already. I also own an Ibook G4, 14", 1.42 GHz, 1.5 GB RAM, 60 GB HD and Superdrive.

I am not impressed with the MBP, nor for the speed, neither for the performance. Running together the Ibook and the MacBook Pro I found the Ibook faster than the MBP for some tasks like printing and opening large photo files.

WiFi performance of the Ibook G4 is by far much better than the MacBook Pro, at the Mac store I was told that probably due to the metallic case of the MBP the reception decreases.

I used the Migration Utility to import the IBook and found that the  Spotlight just find the files after being opened with the MBP,  the rest of the imported files must be searched manually the first time you need them, so you better keep your former Mac without formatting for a certain period of time.

Another important issue, the MacBook Pro is a heating machine too. When burning DVD's, the MBP burns too !

The battery life is almost 160 minutes for the MBP and 240 minutes for the IBook G4.

I remark the fun stuff I love of the MBP : The Front Row, the built in Video Camera and the super funny Photo Booth.

Anyway, It's a Mac !  It means that will always work, but in my case I paid too much for a video camera and the Front Row. If you already own a Powerbook or an IBook and you do not need a built in video camera, or running Win XP,  wait for a real different product.
This is a lightweight, fast and reliable computer. Battery life is good compared to other laptops. It runs most software programs.

I strongly recommend this computer to Apple users, as well as PC users.

If you are looking to buy a laptop that perform as a next generation clock, this is it.

Note:

I had some difficulty finding add-ons and a good carrying case for this machine. There are not a lot of options, since this model is new.
About a year, or so, ago I got wind of Apple's pending move to Intel chips, which made me raise an eyebrow.  I never really intended to make the jump, but my first taste of the Intel Duo Apple computer (Mac Mini --- see my review) convinced me otherwise.  One of my biggest concerns was the investment I have in PC software, some of which I just can't part with until developers catch up with the capabilities of the new Mac's.  Shortly after I purchased my Mac Mini, "Bootcamp" was introduced (probably for people like me).  I have been absolutely blown away by the ease of use of my MacBook Pro, the software bundled with it, and the fact that so much of what I've been running in the Windows world was available to me already (much of what's out there comes with Windows & Mac install CD's).  I am an application developer, technical instructor and amateur graphic artist.  On the professional side I use programs like Poser 6, Vue 5 Infinite, Shadow, Macromedia Flash 8 / Dreamweaver 8, etc., and all run flawlessly and faster on the MacBook Pro.  Thanks to Bootcamp, I don't have to reinvest in programs I had already recently purchased for the Window's side (Quicken 2006, etc.).  I simply installed Bootcamp, and go any way I choose, until the time comes for upgrades, which I will now do on the Mac side.  For those of you considering making the switch, I have two comments: (1) Come on in --- the water's fine! and (2) Get a copy of David Pogue's "Mac OS X: The Missing Manual, Tiger Edition" --- it's worth three times the price, will have you proficient in no time, and is downright entertaining.
I've bought Apple computers for several years, the 2 most recent a Quad Power MAC G5 and a BRAND NEW Macbook Pro 15" both from Amazon.  When I say the Macbook Pro is brand new I mean less than a month old.  The LCD has developed a problem which the local authorized repair center says is a manufacturing problem, but it is not covered under Apple Warranty.

I just spent the past 1/2 hour talking with a snotty customer relationship manager "Leela x40169" who kept on telling me "Apple doesn't have manufacturing problems", when that didn't work, it was "Amazon must have done something", and then, I laughed at this one, "You might have gotten a used one from Amazon... you know you need to be careful...."

I would be very careful about purchasing the MacBook pro now.
As the above title would suggest, this is my first mac. I have grown up on PCs as due to my Dad's work they have always been in the house. Some of my friends though had dabbled in the Apple arena and I must say that the design of macs in recent years really grabbed my attention. Those mac using friends really swore by their computers whilst my Dad had often complained about Apple Inc in dealing with them through his work. He would also say, "they look nice but you'd never buy one." I bought an ipod almost 2 years from now, one of the very first people I know to have got one at the time, and the ipod was fantastic so my only dealing with Apple had been positive.

So why not? I saved up in my part-time job over my university break and purchased the Macbook Pro. With Macbooks at a bit of premium, the Apple shop that I bought it from were great as they were able to get me one from another store and deliver it to me the next day. No waiting for 3-4 weeks.

I have been using it now for nearly a month and the thought that goes through my mind is how could I ever go back to a PC? Unless Steve Jobs personally came to my house and spat on me, it would take a lot to pull me away. People often use the 'car analogy' and I think that is accurate. I really feel as though I am in a BMW or Range Rover Vogue whilst my brother next to me on his Dell is getting by in a Hyundai.

First of all, the boot time is crazy. Does 10 seconds sound quickish? All the general apps are speedy (iTunes pops straight up, whilst it loaded for a little while on my Dad's incredibly expensive Toshiba) and cruising through the internet seems as good as it gets. The screen is a perfect size and shape and the front row is great to show off. The icons magnifying and jumping, the mag-safe connector, the backlit keyboard glowing in the dark, and general weight and 'thinness' make the computer a joy to use.

The biggest thing though is that I haven't really had any problems (touch wood). The computer has never frozen and needed to be re-booted, and whilst this is certainly one of Apple's marketing catch phrases, this is a big thing coming from a PC user who constantly was forced to 'Control, Alt, Delete'. I also download programs without fear knowing that viruses are not an issue. Up until now, different types of programs that I have wanted have been easy to find. Whilst on a grand scale PCs would have a lot more programs, to date I would say that a lot of the mac versions floating around are of a high quality and other mac users would have road tested them and determined whether or not they are worth the effort.

As far as using the OS is concerned it has been rather easy. I would think that a life long mac user would find it harder to go from mac to windows. This is definitely another compliment. So far, the only annoying thing is that often movies and music videos on internet sites are not mac applicable. Perhaps there is software out there to remedy this or it's just a small downside to macs. I don't know.

I was very surprised just how much software was already bundled onto the computer. I haven't yet really delved into the movie and music editing-type applications that macs are famous for, so there is still more fun to come. Furthermore, in buying a mac, you seem to be joining an exclusive club of 'creatives' and 'yuppies' where everybody who owns one is keen to share software and experiences, and are simply very enthusiastic about their computers.

Quite simply, the Macbook Pro (I really doubt that there is a better laptop computer out there) and the Apple Mac experience so far has been excellent. I look in pity at PC users around me because not only do I know what they are going through, but I also know that they obviously do not realize just how much easier and more fun a computer experience can be.
The first thing I did after the reception was to check the serial num, it started with W8615. Some reports said they had corrected various defects since W8611(so called revision D),so I felt easy until I started it up. I can clearly hear the famous high-frequency whining sound. Continuous noise at that frequency really drives me mad. I had to do some immediate research and finally got the mirror wedget trick and it did work ( I'm wondering if there is any similar trick under XP environment). Another well-known problem, the heating problem also worried me. It became very hot after one hour or so, without running any heavy-duty applications. If it runs on battery, the accumulation of heat seems to be slower; but when the AC is plugged in, it just becomes too hot to touch (the rear side) in a short time. It's like a P4 laptop with tons of dust stuck in the exhaust vent .  I don't think anybody can work with it on the LAP.  Some minor  aspects: when using the 2-prong plug (not grounded), the palm rest and exterial part give off some electrical feedback, but mostly it's bearable.

These are the major cons I found. As to the others, like the superior OS, stylish design work, etc, I think most reviews have covered too much already.
I suggest checking out Apple's website and look up Bootcamp.  It is an official Apple beta that will actually partition the harddrive on these MacBooks and create a driver cd so that you can install WindowsXP on the MacBook.  All you will need is an install CD of windows.  Once installed, you will be able to choose which OS to run, OSX or WinXP.  From several comments out on the net, the MacBook will actually increase the performance of several programs that run on XP up to 20%.

This is my plan, when I get it done, I will let you all know how it turns out.
I went from a G4 powerbook to a macbook pro. The new machine is definitely a more powerful and faster computer (and it runs less hot). If you use your computer for the standard functions -- word processing, web browsing, watching movies, downloading photographs and the like -- you won't notice that much increase in speed, however, because most software has not yet been rewritten for the new intel chip. I really notice the juice when I use software that has been updated -- for example, Mac's own web-browser, Safari. There the acceleration is really obvious.

But if you are still happy with your older mac, you might want to wait a bit before investing in this new computer, until more programs have been adapted to the chip. I have encountered a couple of problems trying to use programs at my university library which just have not yet been updated even for the new Safari. It's frustrating when your computer is out ahead of the rest of the software, sometimes even rendering it unusable.

Also, I was a little disappointed that Mac did not take advantage of rolling out their intel chip to make design changes in the appearance of the computer. There are a couple of small changes in the look and functionality -- I like the new magnetic connection for the power cord, and, as they say, you can never be too rich or too thin. At one inch, this notebook is about as thin as they come. In spite of all that (and call me superficial), this machine basically looks just like my old one. I'd come to expect more dramatic visual innovations from the generally cutting-edge design team at Macintosh.

As for being able to run Windows too, why would one ever want to? Well, I'm not a gamer, I guess. I'm just not tempted by the dual functionality, especially since I'd have to pay money for a Windows program. Not happening.
To add to the great features of the MacBook Pro is the really neat addition so that you can now dual boot Windows XP SP2 on the MacBook alongside OS X!  For further details and features, see the following:

http://www.apple.com/macosx/bootcamp/
The keyboard has a very weird layout.  So weird, in fact, that I decided to return my m35x-s349 - very similar to this one - and pay a 15% restocking fee at Best Buy (Amazon doesn't have a restocking fee for laptops as far as I know).  The biggest issue I had with the keyboard is that there is no Ctrl key on the right side of the keyboard.  If you use computers throughout the day you would likely use this key with the arrow keys and your right hand to jump around text and spreadsheets, among other things (pasting, copying, etc).  Also, the Windows button is on the top - for me not as big of a deal but other reviewers had an issue with that.

However this laptop is a very good laptop other than this, and at a very good price...  lots of memory and hard drive space, DVD burner, awesome widescreen screen, and Toshiba is one of the most reliable laptop brands according to Consumer Reports (Apple is by far the most reliable, followed by both Sony and Toshiba).

After returning the product I purchased the Sony VAIO VGN-A250 from Amazon.  Almost identical features - the only differences are that the Sony DVD burner is a double layer drive (not super important for the majority of the public), and the Sony memory card reader only accepts Memory Sticks (which Sony cameras use) whereas Toshiba's memory card reader accepts 5 different types of cards (including SD, the most popular).  Additionally the Sony turns out to be $100-200 more.

Lastly, Toshiba appears to be replacing their M35X line with M45 at the moment, which at a first glance is even cheaper, so keep a lookout for those.
Anyone considering a purchase of a Toshiba Satellite series computer such as the M45 should run a search on the terms Toshiba satellite overheating. My experience has been that Toshiba does not stand by its products, cannot repair the chronic problems with this series and will not extend warranties or offer replacement to customers who have endured numerous "repairs." The problem cited below with air circulation is well known to Toshiba sat series sufferers and to Toshiba, which has been taken to court over related issues on the 5005, do a Google. Customer service is horrid, out of the Nixon White House. The satellite series computers work well when they work. But Toshiba should be in the lemon-aide biz, not the computer biz. They do make good TVs, though.
Bought this notebook 3 days ago and have been working it hard ever since. Before I say my piece, just a couple of comments regarding the other reviewers. First, brightness. This computer screen is made by the same people as Sony. The person that compared screens probably didn't check to see if the brightness was turned up on the Toshiba. If the Sony was plugged in, and the Toshiba was on battery, the power settings would have dimmed the Toshiba screen. Hey, if the Sony really is brighter, it will just fade sooner, right?  ;-)

Second, as for the 1-star rating by the person who had all the crashes, the odds of three computers crashing due to no fault of the owner are something like 100,000,000 to 1. Not a misprint. With mean time between failures in the 100,000s of hours, it just won't happen. The MOST likely cause of the crashing is software that the user installs, either consciously or unconsciously. I don't think that it is fair to give 1 star. Also, as for technical support in India, the reason these modern PCs are less than $2000 is that the manufacturers outsource support. I suspect the technician was as frustrated with the user.

*** UPDATE ***
Lockup issue when online and going from battery to AC:

- M. Ranake "mrasnake" posted an excellent review regarding this Laptop locking up if "you have wireless enabled" and go from battery to AC power. Actually, you can have wireless enabled and be on a wireless network, but if you have IE running, you will lock up the computer whether IE is the focus window or not (at least that is what happened to me). If I closed out of IE prior to plugging in power...no problems. I also tried using PC-Cillin (firewall software) to temporarily halt internet traffic prior to plugging back in...no lock up. I don't know if the same thing will happen if you are running Outlook or another web browser. It is an issue that you need to consider before buying. I'm still tickled pink with this laptop.

*** UPDATE ***
Overheating:

- While it hasn't happened to me, I have seen a couple of posts on this laptop overheating. If you are not on battery, do not try to run this laptop on a pillow. It needs airflow at high power, and some of the airflow comes from the bottom (also on the left side).

*** Off my soap box ***

PROS:
-Knock out gorgeous design
-Beautiful, breathtaking screen (blows my customers away)
-Fast (running many of the standard games, Photoshop, etc., with no problems and high quality)
-Good sound
-Big hard drive
-Adequate memory
-Overall just a very nice, professional, beautiful laptop for an excellent price ($1250 at CCity)

CONS:
-Mediocre software (by the way, exact same as on the Sony quoted by another reviewer)
-Need more memory (cheap online, less than $70 for 512M at NewEgg)
-Um...hmmm...no other complaints!

Buy it; you will love it.

Best to all,
Mike
When I first saw this laptop it seemed perfect - great screen, thin, light, perfect keyboard, etc.  But after placing it directly next to the new Sony VGN-FS550, I couldn't believe the difference.  The screen on the Sony was MUCH brighter and the Sony seemed to be better built (no flex in the screen, nicer materials, better fit & finish, etc.)

Pros:
- TruBrite screen (better than average, but not as bright as Sony FS)
- relatively thin and light considering specs
- placement of speakers ABOVE keyboard rather than below on M35
- great keyboard
- very quiet, runs cool (if properly ventilated!), still haven't heard fan
- exceptional price ($1250 online)

Cons:
- lots of pre-loaded and worthless software
- DDR memory rather than faster DDR2 memory
- slower 4200rpm hard drive
- Toshiba reliability is better than average but not great
- wireless performance is average
I recieved my laptop last week and have been working it out ever since.  I am an electroinc musician and I am running Ableton Live 3.0 on it with no problems so far (See [...] for a sample of the music I've created on this thing).  Transfering my files over from my old computer was no problem.  I just plugged into my network router and downloaded all my files and mp3's.  Installing all my music software was also no problem.  I did have a little trouble installing the M-Audio Quattro software for my USB Audio module, but that was mostly because of the crappy instruction manual from M-Audio and not because of the laptop.

The thing is damn fast!  I was previously running Ableton Live on a 750 mhz AMD Athalon machine.  Often, my CPU usage bar would creep up to 70% or more.  But these same tracks now only push up the bar to about 15%.  I can tweek effects, pile on the reverb and do live editing with no gapping, no freezing, no crashing and no spontaneous restarts (all problems i was having with my old PC).

The battery life seems to be good.  But so far, I've only been watching DVD's on battery power.  I can run a 2.5 hour movie and still have 20 minutes of battery life or so.  The real test will be producing music on battery power which will be much more CPU intensive.

The wide screen monitor is beautiful, and I had no trouble setting up my old CRT for using dual monitors for added workspace.  It is very simple to set it up in the control panel.  It seems though, that you need to set it up each time you want to use dual monitors, but I could be wrong.  I haven't really figured out all the ins and outs of this thing yet.

So over all, this is a good, truly mobile, machine at a very fair price and I am quite pleased with it.  If I have any problems with it in the future, I will update this review.

EDIT AUG/2005
Still very happy with my laptop.  I have read about other people having wireless/battery lockup problems.  At this moment, I am unplugging the AC adapter and switching to battery... Still typing.  Now at this moment I am plugging back in the AC adapter...  No problems.. This has not been a problem at all on my system.

I have competed in a Laptop Battle with this machine as well, running on batteries with no problems either.  For a video of my battle performance see [...]

There ARE a couple problems I have noticed after about 6 months usage:

1. I am not sure but it seems the display is 'bleached' out towards the bottom and right sides of the screen.  It is only really visable if the image showing is very dark and I have the lights off, and only when viewing at an angle.  Not sure what to think of this.  I don't know how long it's been like this and it doesn't seem to be worsening.  It is a little upsetting but like I said, it is barely noticable.

2. My wireless card does not always turn on after I switch it off.  I have solved this problem by just never switching it off but again, it is a little upsetting.

Over all I am still very pleased with this machine.  It is light.  It is fast.  And the display is (for the most part) beautiful.  I am still producing music with it.  I use it probably 50-60 hours a week and it almost never crashes.  I noticed that Costco now sells an updated version of of this machine for about $1400 and it has a 100gig HD instead of 80, but I don't regret buying mine when I did.  Computers will always get better no matter how long you wait to buy.
I bought this a few days ago and it has been working perfectally. The only reason why I rated it a 4 is that I have been having a hard time trusting to go with Toshiba again. I had Satellite 1955-S803 which broke in 3 years and I spent $2,400.00 on that! This one was $1,699.99 which isn't too bad. I was either going to buy a HP Pavilion dv1000 or this one. I thought I should go with this one because the screen was larger and it looked nicer. I thought when I walked out of the store that I had made a mistake but when I took it home I knew it wasn't. I haven't used the DVD+/-RW or CD-RW Combo Drive but I can't wait until I do. The speed of this notebook is very fast and it connected with my router right away. 512 MB RAM is enough for me and in 2 years I will probably upgrade it to the highest that is on the market for notebooks. 80 GB is one of the highest hard drive capacity you can find. The dv1000 had a 100 GB hard drive but I really don't care. I would recommend this for someone who is on the go and wants good battery life (lasted about 3 or 4 hours) or someone just wanting to buy a safe reliable computer.
After months of research, I narrowed by search to this one and the Sony FS550. This was looked better, the sony one had tacky white keyboard.

Spent 1700 and got it home. It CRASHED the next day! completly. I lost everything on it..the Toshiba costumer support was terrible...after talking for hours..with someone in I think INDIA! i was put to someone I could actually understand...

he could not help me either..told me to take it back to store.

At the store, more arguing later.

Got another one...

are you ready.

got it home again...it crashed again. it was slow, the hard drive failed. I am on to my third one..and the explorer on it crashed..yes..I am taking it back and I want my money back...this time..I am fed up. WHy don't staff at toshiba read these and realize their cosumter service is NOT GOOD. If they don't care about their costumers...it will affect the product and the company's reputation.
I love this laptop! I've been using it heavily for several weeks and I haven't had any problems. It hasn't locked up once, and I've used it for hours with 5 programs running(excel, word, onenote, firefox, acrobat reader), several windows each, and it didn't even slow down a bit. I use the wireless connection on battery, on AC, connecting it and disconnecting it while surfing the web, and no problems.

And the trubrite display is great!
I purchased a Toshiba M45-S331 on Feb. 2 at Office Depot for $1299.99 after rebates.  I got it home, and fell in love with it instantly...until I decided to try out the wireless.  I had my power features set so that when I was on battery it switched to the maximum life mode and when I was on AC it was the Maximum performance mode.  I was walking around the house wireless surfing the internet - no problem....until I plugged my AC back in.  The machine locked up hard.  No ctrl+alt+del...no nothing....it was froze.  I called it a glitch and cut it off and back on.  I was working on battery, and plugged it up again while surfing the net and it hard locked again.  I assumed I had a bad laptop, so I returned it to Office Depot on Feb 3.  I took another one home thinking surely that it wouldn't do this....but it did.  I was also able to duplicate the problem on the one on display at Office Depot.  It seems as long as you don't have your wireless turned on...it will do fine going from battery to AC.  As long as you don't plan on wirelessly surfing the net and plugging up to AC at the same time, it should be a great laptop.  One side note - this was the only toshiba model that had this problem that Office Depot had on display. But...I decided to try my luck with Sony so I ordered one today.
I went to buy this laptop and I'm still struggling to hear its fan as it's really quiet. When I tried to lift it I was surprised to realise how light it was and I'm still waiting for its battery to end. When I compared its TruBrite screen next to M35X S309 I no longer had a doubt - the screen really makes a difference. Given that my old toshiba laptop - had it for 2.5 years - never presented an issue despite turning it on and then putting in to standby 10 times a day, this laptop looks like the best investment one can make at this period.

OK, I'll say a negative thing so that I don't sound too positive. The keyboard could present greater resemblence to a desktop but this is not something that cannot be used in longer than a week.
When my Sony GRX-550 laptop crashed, I took it to Best Buy in Boynton Beach, Florida, and waited seven weeks while the Geek Squad -- and I do mean Geek -- decided whether to repair or replace it under a Professional Performance Plan.  SEVEN WEEKS!  All those weeks of unanswered phone calls and e-mails made me mighty mad.  When I finally got through -- by calling corporate and asking it to patch me through -- and threatened to tell my tale to local consumer reporters, the store managers miraculously and uncharacteristically made a smart move and gave me a brand spanking new Toshiba M45-S331.

This machine outperforms my GRX-550 by leaps and bounds, which I guess is to be expected in a newer computer.  It has a bright screen, fast processor, plenty of memory -- 512 mb expandable to 2 gb -- dvd burner, and enough ports to satisfy the most demanding multi-tasker.  There's also a built-in wireless feature that I haven't tried yet.

All that and IT'S QUIET!  I mean it's quiet.  My old Sony laptop clicked and whirred constantly.  When I was researching machines to replace it after the crash, I listened to other Sony laptops in Best Buy and found they had the same annoying habit.  I don't know exactly why my computer was so noisy -- it sounded like the hard drive was talking to itself -- but I do know that it could be heard from every room in my apartment and often appeared as the soundtrack to my worst nightmares.

After several weeks of heavy use, I can tell you I'm very happy with my Toshiba M45-S331.  If it keeps on running the way it is now for the next couple of years, I will be a Toshiba loyalist.  If it doesn't, Best Buy sweetened the replacement deal with another three year Professional Performance Plan, and you'll probably be reading about another horrible ordeal trying to get them to make good on it.

The only note of caution I have for buyers of the Toshiba Satellite M45-S331 is that it does not come with a parallel port, which means if you have a printer with a parallel cord, you will have to buy one with a USB end to plug it into the computer.  This could add about 20 bucks to the cost of the computer.

Happy computing.
The Sony VAIO VGN-FS570 is another great Notebook from Sony. The appearance, at least to me, is a variant of the Apple Powerbook look, and is an aesthetically pleasing design. Immediately I was impressed with the 15.4 widescreen display, which using XBRITE technology makes viewing text and images a pleasure (I am used to an Apple Powerbook by comparison). Importantly for me this variant of the new FS series has both a large 100 GB HD and 1GB of RAM. This makes it perform well for most of the intensive tasks you might want to run on it, for example DVD editing or using Photoshop. In many respects it can fill the role of a desktop replacement. In addition, I found battery life was good for this Notebook. Using Intel Centrino mobile technology I was again impressed by the connectivity and wireless range of the Vaio (again in comparison to a Powerbook). The bundled Vaio software is good, and it makes the XP user interface a pretty friendly experience for the uninitiated. Overall I would rate this Notebook very highly, both in terms of performance and aesthetic appearance.
Firstly, let me say this laptop has a great bright display and very fast processor. But it's VERY LOUD - sounded like a vacuum cleaner.  Battery power was barely over 1 hour, it's very heavy and the AC adapter was way too short...

Too bad i had to pay a 15% restocking fee to find all this out.
Reinstall original configuration, I don't know why it does not work well the first time, next erase all garbage software and you have and excellent, fast and incredible notebook.

I'm and developer and my wife is architect and we love it.

Cons:

-You need to burn the recovery Cds.

-A little noisy.

-Could be a nightmare if you try to change the OS.
I own this computer, and I don't have any complaints besides the fact that the battery life is kind of short. Besides that, it is a great item!
Updated: I do realize that the fan is loud on it, though....
If the video quality won't blow you away, maybe the onboard goodies will. I bought mine out the door for $1399.00. Memory Stick slot is a plus since I have Sony PDA and digital camera. One downside though: battery life only lasts 1.5 hours approx. Only if it came with Intel Centrino which only uses a fraction of power that Pentium 4 uses. Overall, it's the best value around.
I initially purchased the K45 to replace my home desktop.  It was purchased for its brand, style and performance.  However, I noticed the fan noise was too intrusive.  Noise level was loud enough to make other people notice.  The bulky design was also disappointing.

The store had no problem exchanging K45 because it had a defective pixel in the screen as well.

K45 was exchanged for FS550 which I am very happy with.
I recently bought this notebook and its lived up to all my expectations. One of the key factors in a sony note book is for sure its display. The 13 " XBRITE display is class apart and allows you to enjoy even movies,websites with flash or makes even a plain vanilla word/excel document look better compared to other displays.

The notebook is also really light and its "THE" choice for road warriors. The battery too is really powerful and allows you to compute for say >3 hours without a problem.

This notebook lacks a DVD writer which really depends on if you are looking for it. Atleast in my case its rare that I would need to burn DVD`s. Also, Notebook is not great for installed software for e.g it comes with XP Home and Trial versions of Office etc. The key thing these do not affect your working in a very big way.

If you are looking for a great notebook then Vaio is defintely the one!
I needed a light and reliable notebook for travel and research and this has filled the bill admirably. It withstood plenty of knocking around, and did the tasks I required (word processing, accessing net with ethernet and wireless connections, downloading and organizing digital photos)quickly and effectively. Did have to initially set it up as described in first review. Don't know why people are complaining about the fan noise, I worked in a quiet library and it was never a problem.
I read the comment about the fan noise this computer has, but I didn't care and bought this computer anyway. I just got this laptop today and the first thing I noticed is how ridiculously loud the fan is. I have a Dell laptop, but I can't hear the fan on my Dell's even when I press my ear against it. I called Sony's Service Center, they told me that alot of customers have called them complaining about the fan problem and a investigation is underway, but I am so pissed off right now because this product has a blatantly defective fan and Sony has failed to pull it out of the market.

Honestly, the fan makes so MUCH noise that this computer is not even worth buying.
This is one of the best laptops I've had....BUT...the fan can drive you crazy! I cannot take this to the library because people might think there's a race car in the computer - that's what it sounds like and it's constant and annoying! Sony says on their support site that the issue is "under investigation" so I didn't want to wait for the results and returned this beauty...
Two questions for current owners of the S-360 only:

1) A reviewer listed it as having only (2) USB 2.0 ports but the specs list (3). How many?

2) Another reviewer was turned off by fan noise. Do other users experience the same problem?
Many positives have been said about this computer and I agree it has many  positives, BUT a big negative can bring its whole appeal down: the fan is tooo noisy and it is operating most of the time even when set to "Level 1 (quiet)".  Stores are very noisy and thus you cannot detect the noise then, but wait until you are at home or the office and then the noise will drive you nuts.  I have owned laptops from Gateway (3), HP (4), Dell and Apple and I had never experienced levels of noise that even get close to this VAIO.
I'm a college student and I've been using this laptop since the beginning of this semster and its just great. Its fast. The keyboard size is perfect. The WiFi wireless is a great plus and gets connection pretty much everywhere. The screen is really clear and I haven't had problems with glare. Plus, I always get comments from friends about how pretty the laptop is. Its a great laptop.
I got my VAIO s260 stolen, so I ended up buying the s360 as a replacement because I liked this series so much.  The only differnece I can see is the 80Gig upgrade, which is more than enough.  I love the design for this laptop. The keyboards are perfect size, and is light enough for me to carry to class everyday without breaking my shoulder. It goes great with the Roadwired Advanced case.
The video card, harddrive, mobile tech, speed, weight/size, battery life, and so much more make this the ultimate laptop.  God bless Sony for creating such a perfect laptop.
I recently bought this notebook 1 month prior and absolutely love it. There are no dead pixels and the screen is great for movies. So far I haven't been bothered by any glare from the screen. The notebook is very light and portable. The screen can seem a little small especially compared with a nonwide screen 14 or 15 inch laptop but it is very sharp and you get used to it. There are no other notebooks in its weight and size class with the ATI 9700 video card which will let you play most of the recent games. Even if you don't play games, subcompact notebooks that use the old Intel integrated graphics won't be able to use the future version of windows as it will require direct x support. The new Intel 900 graphics card does but is not as fast as the ATI 9700. Battery life is great depending on the settings. Routing surfing will give you around 4-5 hours depending on the screen, volume, wifi, and processor settings.  The other 15inch screen thin and light notebooks feel heavy afterwhile especially with all the accessories. Some people have had fan noise issues but I don't notice it, it may be per system.

Cons- All the software is preinstalled which is useless. There is no windows OS cd, you can make a set of windows recovery cds from a hidden partition on the harddrive which will reinstall the system to its factory state. There is no S-video out. Only 2 USB ports.  The harddrive is not an easy upgrade but some people may notice a difference going from a 4200rpm to a 7200 rpm drive but I didn't notice much. Also to use Page up and down you need to use the FN key which is a little annoying for fast scrolling. It's possible to upgrade the CPU and harddrive but I'm not sure how the heat will affect the system in this small form factor. Also this baby uses the sony memory slot which very few people use. An SD slot would be more useful. You can see dust accumulate on the screen easily. sony support is also poorly rated though I haven't used it. It also uses micro dimms which are expensive. 512 mbs will run you around 120 dollars.

If you get this system-These are some things you must do and have.

1-Make a recovery set of CDs and buy windows xp to do a clean install which you cant with the recovery cds. Windows home is fine unless you are going to use this for a university or corporate network. All the drivers can be installed with the recovery cd without installing all the other crappy applications that was included.

2-Downloading tune xp to optimize windows. Also check out black viper's web site(you can google it) to disable certain windows xp services that slow down memory. Delete unused fonts to make windows load faster.

3-Get an optical mouse. The two best are the microsoft notebook optical mouse and the Logitech V500 Cordless Notebook Mouse USB

4-The belkin LCD cleaning kit which contains a 2 sided brush, 1 for dust and the other for applying the isopropyl alcohol solution to clean the screen.

5-At least 1 gig of memory.

6-Open office which is a freeware office utility sweet which is smaller then ms office and has most of the essential features. Version 2 is still in beta but is about to be released which has improved functions. Only con is powerpoint is not as beefier as microsofts.

7-DVD shrink, which lets you store dvds on the harddrive to save battery

8-antivirus

9-adaware, spybot, spywareblaster, post it notes lite

With the 250 rebate, this baby is worth it. Fujitsu is another alternative with a great screen as well but their small notebooks don't have the good video card. You probably don't need this much power if you are just going to do internet, word processing, or powerpoint but don't skimp on screen quality as you will regret it.
I recently purchased the predecessor to this model.  Mine has a 1.33 GHz processor, but everything else is essentially the same.  The laptop is indeed a beautiful piece of design ... aluminum casing with jeweler size screws.  My problem is that I dropped my case containing my laptop by accident, and when I opened it I found that the case dented and warped easily.  Remember, this is brushed aluminum and not stainless steel or titanium.  When I called my local Apple store, I was quoted a price of $663 to replace the case.  Thus, I think if you can do without the slightly faster processor and graphics memory, go for the ibook.  Its composite plastic while not as beautiful as the Powerbook's metal, should take a beating much better.  After all, accidents do happen!
This computer runs really really really hot.  So much so that it actually warps the metal case so that it won't sit on all 4 feet at once.  I've taken it to the Apple store several times to be repaired and they have told me that it's just a design flaw.  For $500 less, you can get an iBook that is almost the same machine, and far sturdier.  I've had an iBook for the past 4 years, and I wish that I had gotten another one instead of this PowerBook.

That being said, this is a fast sexy computer.  I just wish that it ran a bit cooler.
The machine itself is excellent, and most importantly, the initial set-up in Tiger was a breeze - it ported everything from my previous PBook exactly as promised - including all of Adobe Creative Suite and much other software.  Extra RAM requires the world's smallest Philips head screw driver (#00), but otherwise was easy and cheap = $104 for 1 meg to max it out.
This is the laptop that has finally freed me completely from Windows.  I thought about the 15" for the screen real estate, but I'm glad I went with 12".  The portability is fantastic.  I'm enjoying it so much that it may be hard for people to take me seriously :)
There is a lot of attention to the Mac vs Windows topic recently, as Apple has begun to gather attention as being capable of doing everything a Windows computer can - word processing, e-mail, Internet browsing, and everything else.  For most Windows users, the Mac software will feel different, but essentially do the same thing.  (To top it off, Microsoft Office is offered for Mac as well, presumably for former Windows users that are uncomfortable making the switch...but keep in mind that Apple has other programs that do pretty much the same thing.)

Now, I am looking for a laptop.  Just because an Apple machine can do what I need doesn't make it my choice.  It's a matter of which does a better job - Windows or Mac.

Since I am not one to rely on ultra-biased reviewers on either end, I have gone to visit the Apple Store a number of times, specifically to try out this PowerBook.  I highly recommend that if you are seriously considering what will work best for you, do not just rely on other people - go see for yourself.

Having said that, instantly the differences were obvious.  The programs I tried worked beautifully, even intuitively.  Imagine not knowing anything about Windows and starting from scratch at computers - that is what I had expected.  Wrong!  Instead of the cluttered desktop, the long list of programs, and the general cheap and unorganized feel of Windows, I found Mac's operating system to be clean and efficient...everything was at my finger tips.  In short, after fiddling with the PowerBook a number of times, I am convinced that it can not only do everything I need it to, but it can do it better than Windows can.  Even more, Mac is more secure because most viruses are written against Windows, being that Windows is the majority.

I look forward to distancing myself from memories of Windows worries....  For example, Windows Media Player doesn't work for me any more - I get a message saying "INTERNAL PROGRAM ERROR".  Now, I'm no computer technician, but all I know is that such errors are frequent, I'm annoyed and hindered by them, and that typically, Microsoft treats it as my problem, not theirs.  "INTERNAL PROGRAM ERROR"?  More like, "Microsoft can't write decent programs."  Where Microsoft is infamous for the Blue Screen of Death, Apple is known to simply work.

Having seen that one computer company prides itself in that its programs actually work and lives up to that guarantee, I have no reason to put up with the cheap mess and insulting incompetence of Windows.  I had thought Apple computers to be expensive, and still do, because $1500 is a lot of money.  But, $1500 on a product that works is far better, in my mind, than any sum for a product that makes me mad, that is, Windows.

Now, maybe you are just fine with Windows, and somehow you have avoided the errors and you don't mind constantly downloading patches and service packs.  Still, try out this PowerBook if you are looking for a laptop.  See if it doesn't FEEL like a quality product.  (Keep in mind, also, that some very serious people are users of Macs...namely, professional artists, schools, small businesses, the United States Military, and certain departments of Microsoft!)(I would post some URLs but it's against the rules.)
i've been a mac user all my life, i have tried a few windows based systems but they just seem poorly integrated and clnuky and too much trouble, i don't mind playing with them at work for the 'geek factor' but i do all of my music and digital artistry on my macs and wouldn't have it any other way.

since the 12" powerbooks came out i have been drooling over them, but i had a 15" titanium powerbook and then recently got a g5....but when my titanium powerbook practically fell apart, i decided to buy the 1.5hz 12"pb (combo drive).

i absolutely love this thing, its so small and cute but it can handle anything you throw at it, i thought the screen would be too small to do my graphics work on it but i can easily sketch away with my graphics tablet wherever i am.

the battery life is good, its compact and relatively lightweight, made of metal, built very solid and runs osx.  what else could you want?!

the one thing i was a little unhappy with was the screen because its just a regular lcd, alot of 'windoze' notebooks are using those nice shiny 'crystal bright' displays.

if apple had those displays in a widescreen form factor on this thing, it would be absolute perfection, bar none.

but overall im very happy with it and its abilities to perform anything i throw at it.

if you are considering one then go to an apple centre and play around with one for a while...i bet you will go home with one, or want to :D

osx tiger is fast, sleek, powerful, futuristic, beautiful.

and below the hood in the terminal you have access to its darwin/unix.

ive never had a virus EVER in my life thanks to being a mac user, no spyware, MUCCCH less chances of being hacked, my titanium powerbook only crashed once in the whole 3-4 years i had it, and my g5 and 12" powerbook have NEVER crashed.

sure it is possible to get a 'lemon' and have problems, it IS a computer afterall and there can be things that go wrong, but overall....macs just work. and in doing so they let you work without screwing around with settings and troubleshooting.

i honestly don't know why people still bother with windows, its primative compared to osx.
I am writing this review in order to give you my thoughts on this powerbook versus the last guys that wrote a review about switching. First off there's no way you can compare apples to oranges, or in this case Apple to Windows computers. Because first off Apple's processor is much more efficent in the way it handels information. You can not look at Gzh! there are many more steps involved than just that. Now I will go down the line of "cons" that superman2k3 had.

1 - The screen is small, there's no doubt about it but that's what you have to sacrifice for the smallness of the 12 inch powerbook, and I still do not know what he means by clearity in the font, I can easily read what I am typing, what folders say on my desktop and anywhere else there is typing of FONTS!.

 2 - I have 512 mb of RAM in my powerbook. It runs perfectly smooth and flawless. My powerbook 1.5 ghz runs faster than my neighbors 3.0 ghz pentium desktop!

 3 - First off with the accessories the $60 mouse he's talking about is the Apple bluetooth wireless mouse. You can get a corded mouse much less. And second of all you DO NOT have to buy just Apple accessories. I have a mini wireless mouse that I got when I had a windows laptop (with windows XP) and to use it on the windows laptop I needed to install drivers and other software, well one night I decided to try it on my powerbook and it worked GREAT! with no drivers, nothing. The manufacturers website never stated it made for a Mac! Only for windows 98, 2000, ME, XP ect.

4 - Now I don't know about you but I personally don't have any reason what so ever to get to my hard drive. With 60 or 80 gigabyte discs I don't think I will be randomly droping new ones in. In fact I don't think I will ever even open up my RAM slot for more RAM. There is just nothing inside the computer I would ever want to mess with. Instead I would just send it in to Apple.

5 - Well in a way this is true. Most software for Windows won't work for a Mac but you can however get a $80 software called Virtual PC made my Microsoft for the Mac computer. This program enables you to run every program made for a PC. And when you buy future programs you will just buy the mac version instead.

6 - What do you mean NON SCROLLING. This trackpad in my powerbook has a built in scrolling function. Just drag two fingers over it in a webpage, a word file (yes Microsoft makes all of the Office suite, Word, Excel, Powerpoint, ect. for Mac) pdf's, Jpegs, you name it it works. And I know it only has a single button but if you need a sort of "right click" just hold down the Ctrl button at the same time. A list (just like on a Windows) pops up.

7 - As I stated earlier you can't compare apples to oranges. The Apple computer will run faster, smoother, and is already pre-loaded with amazing applications that would cost you hundreds of dollers on a PC like iPhoto, but mostly like iMovie and iDVD.

8 - Innovation, give me a break!!! Apple invented the personal computer. They wrote the Mac Operating System (OS) that Microsoft eventially copied back in the 80's. In fact there was a huge lawsuit over it. You can search Google if you want to learn more! And Apple has to compete with PC's everyday. I mean you think about it, a person is not going to buy both an Apple laptop and a PC laptop together! THINK HERE MAN!

9 - You DO NOT have to order any more warrenty from Apple, Apple gives you a one (1) year warrenty for your machine already, in fact better than most PC manufactures, however you may want to purchase the extended warrenty because laptops get a more rugged approach to them then desktops. Now this would be the same case as if I were buying a Dell, HP, Compaq (owened by HP so is relativley the same machine) or any other PC. And they're all in the same price range for the extended warrenty.

10 - As I stated earlier (I seem to have to repeat myself a LOT!) almost all hardware devices work both ways. And software, if you want to keep your PC software you can purchase an $80 virtuall PC software that will run it just fine!

  Now I hope I did not make anyone angery by this, it's just the facts. And in conclusion the Powerbook is a remarkable tiny, shiny, all around great machine that has the looks and feel of Apple all around, from the hardware, to the OS it is all Apple (with no viruses or spyware) and the best part of it is that if you ever have any problems at all, because Apple makes the whole thing (inside and out) there is just one (1) number to call for anything dealing with it. Try doing that with a PC company. They'll just refer you to another company who will refer you back. That's if you get an actuall representative! Not just a computer on the other end. Well I hope this helps to clear up any thoughts you may have. I am a TRUE switcher. I went from a PC for five (5) years to a mac for now my 3rd month. And I LOVE IT!

  One more thing "Once you go Mac, you'll never go Back!"

  ~God Bless!~
I made the "switch" last fall when the 20" iMac G5 was released, and was looking to pick up a laptop with the same quality hardware and OS. I knew I wanted an ultra-portable laptop, partially because of the price and partly because a laptop is just not meant to require a desk to use it. (In my opinion, anything over 15" or 6 pounds is a desktop-replacement). I had originally considered the 12" iBook, which is a great value (1.2 GHz + Airport Extreme!) for the money. In the end, after getting the "i"Mac, I though I'd go with the "Power"book. My decision was partially due to the realization my 15 GB iPod is about 60% full, so importing the iTunes collection would have taken up a good chunk of the iBook's 30 GB drive.

It's quite a bit more expensive than the iBook, but you get a faster processor, a disk drive that twice as big and faster, Bluetooth, and an aluminum case that looks stunning. Also worthy of mention would be the new features in the 2005 Powerbooks, namely a scrolling trackpad (I wish my iMac had one now!), Sudden Motion Sensor that'll park the disk heads if it senses that it might have just been dropped, and Bluetooth 2.0, a standard so new there's no peripherals that'll use the 2.0 speeds, only its 1.1/1.2 legacy support. 512 MB is finally enough for standard usage (I can't endorse anything less than 512 MB for OS X), but I still upgraded the memory. Too bad Apple still has 256 MB built-in, as I had to pull the socketed 256 MB SO-DIMM to put in a 512 MB SO-DIMM, unlike the 15" and 17" which come with a single 512 MB SO-DIMM and an open slot.

If you can afford the extra money over the iBook and need the features, this machine will quickly become your pride and joy. If a 30 GB HD is big enough and you won't be doing heavy-duty iMovie editing, I still believe the iBook is an unbelievable price/performance value.
Let me qualify this review by making it clear that I am not a Mac user. My only experience with Mac's is a few mins spent each time I visit Apple store. I am writing this for those thinking of a switch from XP to Mac. I know it will be unpopular with Mac fans but hope it helps you XP users make the right decision.

Powerbook pro's,

1. It looks sleek, smooth and sexy. Nothing in PC world is this well designed.

2. No weekly patches coming from Redmond to apply.

3. No anti-virus or anti-spyware needed (?)

4. Longer battery life than PC laptops but not by much.

5. Can't really think of anything else other than the different and coolness factor.

Con's,

1. Screen, screen, screen. The 12" pbook/ibook just look awful with Mac OS X's anti-aliased fonts. XP's Cleartype seems really really clear in comparison. (Search for "Quartz Extreme" for more details on Apple's website)

2. Need to spend $160+ to put in 1GB RAM (in contrast XP runs similarly fast on just 512MB, about $30 expense for an extra 256MB stick).

3. All accessories are extremely high priced. How about $60 for a mouse?

4. No upgrades, everything except RAM slot is very hard to reach. 2 dozen mini-screws before you reach hard disk!

5. Need to buy new softwares, I have almost everything needed for XP already.

6. Non-scrolling & single button touchpad.

7. Paying atleast 30% premium compared to similar hardware with Wintel laptops.

8. Stuck with propreitary things Apple does, no innovation or competetion like in PC world.

9. Need to buy Apple's extended warranty because very few people can open or repair it. And laptops can't be fixed at home unlike desktops.

10. Lots of softwares and devices just don't work on Mac.

>>What good is a laptop that would give you strain with its tiny fancy fonts?

>>What good is wasting your hard earned money for nothing special?

>>What good is a fancy laptop if it can run only propreitary software from Apple and very little else?

In short, don't fall for that iPod "halo effect" that Wall Street analysts are talkin about. The iBook/Powerbook look very good but are no good for most XP users, unlike iPod. XP itself is very stable by now, just needs lots of patches/updates. Don't waste your time & money on this.
I originally saw this product advertised on ComputerShopper and fell in love.  Circuit City seems to have the lowest price but there are a few availability issues depending on where you live.  I bought mine from Amazon and it was delivered in less than 2 days with standard shipping!  This is perfect for office/student use, NOT for the hard-core gamer.  I travel a lot and take lots of digital pictures, so this is perfect in terms of portability and performance.

Pros:

Small form factor

Huge hard drive

Great battery life (avg. 3 hrs)

DVD burner

SD/MMC card reader

External monitor support

Cons:

No floppy drive

No manual or support documentation

No original discs for installed software (for backup)

No IEEE 1394 ports (FireWire)
Like the previous reviewer, this is my first notebook/laptop as well. I bought it as an alternative to the Epson P2000 40GB photo storage unit (that's been sold out everywhere) to download pictures for an upcoming two-week vacation to France. I haven't regretted this decision and think it's even better solution for me overall in the long run.

Not only does this unit have twice the storage (80GB), but being a notebook computer I've also installed Adobe Photoshop CS2 which will enable me to process my images during the vacation instead of doing it all when I get back.  My only extended use has been a three-day trip to Yosemite which was a great opportunity to see how this concept was going to work out.  Being able to download 2+ GB of photo's per day using a Sandisk USB CF reader, see them on the 12.1" screen and also process the RAW files in CS2 was in a word... sweet!  Even the memory hungry CS2 was responsive with the standard 512MB ram - although I'll probably upgrade to a 1GB at some point.

Important factors to me in considering which notebook to buy where screen quality, battery life and weight.  The screen resolution and quality is quite "good", but not as great as the VAIO and some others.  Battery life seems to run a little over 3hrs with continuous use and weighing a little over 4 lbs, it is light!  The wifi works like a champ and connected easily with my D-Link unit at home.  The built-in ethernet port is significantly faster as you'd expect. Although the touchpad and its software work well, I'm too used to using a mouse and also bought a USB mouse.  This system seems to be well made and has a nice quality feel to it. The feel of the keyboard as far as notebooks/laptops go is more than adequate and easy to use.

Oh, and the iGO charger unit that I bought for auto/air/wall charging is also a great convenience factor to think about - one charger does it all.  Finding a nice "sleeve" to simply protect the surface when it's being carried in a suitcase or backpack has been a challenge, but it looks like the 12" Apple iBook dimensions are close enough.  We'll see...
This is my first laptop. I got it at Circuit City for less than here at Amazon.

Battery life is good. The Intel Wireless-G adapter works fine with my Linksys WRT54G -- 48-54Mbps. WRT54GS was no faster. The 80GB hard drive is responsive. Loaded software was adequate. Has two video adapters so you can display on another monitor. Lacks a microphone (has a jack) and FireWire. Speakers are adequate but not great. Touchpad has some good features, but I added a Logitech USB notebook mouse. I have MS Office Pro, Visual Studio 2003 and SQL Server Personal installed and performance is fast.

Keyboard is small but usable. This is a nice small-footprint machine.
its an okay comp for fun and music,, but if you're into youtube or looking for some good speed on the web this is not the one
Beta Mac has an a+ rating with better business bureau and I am pleased with their customer service. They put a new hard drive on the machine after and fixed a broken key. excellent company to work with
I have used my wonderful G4 17 inch screen for several years; upgraded the RAM to 2GB and run Photoshop, Lightroom, etc, with no problems.  This is a cheap way to get a great computer with a huge, beautiful screen.
Esta computadora es sorprendente en rendimiento, sigue siendo costosa, pero es uno de los modelos ms completos que jams se encontrar, con conectividad inalmbrica y Bluetooth, con puertos USB 2, con Firewire primera y segunda generacin, con salida de audio y entrada de audio para dispositivos tradicionales. Es una excelente compra, de alto rendimiento, muy veloz para ser un modelo anterior, y una estabilidad envidiable, jams se me ha detenido o he tenido que darle reset y yo la compre de segunda mano, ya tiene un ao conmigo y no vale la pena cambiarla por las nuevas Intel, porque tienen configuraciones inferiores, y las que se equiparan son muy costosas.
Because it didn't work as well as he said it did it was slow and had tk refresh it when ever it froze
Love it its an older modle but still gets the job done I take it every where i go so when a story pops in my head i flip it open and get to typing it doesnt take but only second sto boot right up. Its light weight
discription shows 15 inch model with cd drive on front i  got a 12 inch with broken battery that can work without wall power and its been a week and the seller has yet to respond do not order from ezcorp
It is good I love it I may buy it  it is a so good offerts I am going to borrow the money I love it it is awesome I love it so much it is cool it is a good offert for the computer
I paid only $200 for mine, even it said it comes only with 512mb by the seller, but mine has max out to 2GB when arrived!! The laptop is tough built, clean screen and keys and good for school work and daily use.
I was totally unsatisfied with this product. The laptop had scratches on it, the computer took foerever to load, and the speakers weren't working properly. In addition, their was no battery life. This computer did not meet my expectations.
It's a bit old, but it's a good bang for your buck! The only thing missing was a built in iSight camera, but apart from that it's pretty good :)
If I was informed that this laptop could not connect to the web, even after we have purchased a internet on the go wireless chip, I would have purchased a new one. Being that it was a Christmas gift and we have never been able to use this laptop it has been very discouraging.
ti was in no condition close to the pitcher nore is it the same typ of compurer shown.

it was packed in a box sidwayse with stirephome inside the computer and screws missing and in the rong places the cd drive was smashed in as well id i wanted to be riped off id buy stuff off ebay
The Power book came poorly packed it was dented and broken the power cord would not connect to the power book, I would ask for my money back, but I think all buyers should be aware of this store and I chalk it up to lessons learned.
this netbook is awsome i just got it yesterday  it rocks, but it has a small touch pad though i would say this is the best netbook i have ever had. Windows 7 starter is awsome i really love it and its so much better than vista and windows xp.
I highly recommend this. Bought it for myself.  Model D250-1206 5 weeks ago.  I have had a laptop and now have a desktop, but have always wanted the ease and portability of a netbook.  This one fits all my needs and is great to carry around,in or outside the home.

The only thing I would like is a longer battery life; so we are going to search for one. I think there is one that gives you 6 hours - this one gives you 3; although I haven't specifically clocked it.  If anyone out there knows where I can get the longer-life battery, I'd certainly appreciate the assistance.

Purchased the Acer Netbook, it works fine, a bit sluggish on the web access but acceptable.  I wrote the comments below some time ago, these note books are no longer viable, I recommend you purchase a regular laptop or go with a tablet.

The main value is its size and functionality for web apps, support for office, general easy of use.

If there was an option to include more (factory installed) memory for a performance upgrade, I would purchase it. This machine, while adequate, is not close to a regular laptop.  The question is: Would the memory upgrade give it a performance pop, or are there other technology throttles in the system, such as the disk drive?  Secondly, a number of people have commented on removing the bloatware installed on the machine, it would be great to have a specific list of what can be removed, some utilities appear to provide critical functionality.
The other concern is the keyboard, on a scale of 1-10, I would give it a 7 for comfort and positioning with other keyboards.

Overall, the Acer is a good value.
Ive heard so many things about,Lap tops and Netbooks  and well I really don't know much, so I did some research on the products and becaues of the reviews on this Acer I decided to take a chance, Wonderful I love it, my battery lasts a good 3 hours, keys are easy to touch and find,some reviews said they have a few problems like having to push hard on the keys, Im having no problems at all, screen is bright and colorfulmy only problem is the key board does not lite up, I bought a lite up keyboard for my home PC and I love it, bought that from Amazon too, Now if this Acer Keyboard lits up then Ill have to redo my review but as of this time I don't see how it would lite up..This is my first Netbook and I truly love it, if I could use 2 at a time Id buy another one, as is Im running my Home PC and this one at the same time, I write at night..
I love it!!  Windows 7 is wonderful, and the computer itself is so lightweight and easy to use.
I think this is great netbook computer . i love it ! its easy to use & carry around . It 's the perfect size 7 works great. If looking for a netbook i do recommend this 1.
Excellent computer! I would definately recommend this product to anyone who is interest in a light weighted computer that allows you to surf on the go.
this is the 1st laptop type computer i have owned.
I travel for my business and I thought I get it to check e mails and skype with my family and this machine does it smoothly and quickly.
I like the light weight and compact size .
It does come with some other software like Microsoft works and some games that I have not used yet.
I loaded it with my wma music files with a 8 gig thumb drive and it loaded quickly.
all in all a nice buy!!!
Use mine mainly for email, web surfing and documents.  Love it!  Does everything my old laptop did at half the weight and half the price.  My battery lasts longer than 3 hours - a big help when traveling.  Much easier when going through airport security. And, it is pretty too!

I did end up buying an external DVD drive so I could make backups, but I easily transferred files from the old computer using a thumb drive.
After a bad experience with an Asus with 9 inch screen and solid state drive (very hard to type on and VERY slow operation) I was quite reluctant to try another netbook but this one was on sale so I went ahead. What I have is the e-machines version which is made by Acer and is identical to the Aspire one.
With an Atom N270 running at 1.6 Ghz it does get rather warm but not unbearable and the speed is well worth it. With few exceptions it runs as fast as my full size laptop and is very enjoyable to surf the web on. The Windows 7 starter is a perfect match for this machine and pleasingly simple with loads of widgets to customize the home screen and desktop endlessly. Oddly Windows 7 starter won't play DVD's as MS wants $80. for the Windows 7 Home Edition that will. Not a real problem as I can get a DVD player for much less than $80. if I want to watch movies on a proper hdtv screen.
I've found that a 93% keyboard as found on 10 inch netbooks is the perfect size. Just large enough for comfortable typing while keeping the machine as small and lightweight as possible. I've investigated a great many more expensive netbooks but this one is totally sufficient for all I do and a bargain to boot.
I got this for my wife as a gift. It's a nice lightweight machine. My complains are it comes with a lot of shovelware (unnecessary programs that hog resources.) Some examples of this were both Norton and McAfee were installed. I replaced those with Windows Essentials. There were some games, some acer utilities, adobe reader (i prefer foxit reader.) I removed all of that and the machine was much snappier. It wouldn't have been reasonable to expect a beginner user to do that, so if you're buying this for someone and you have some computer know how, you should boot it first to get it cleaned up to run best. Windows 7 starter is absolutely fine. The primary limitations are the wallpaper not being able to change and file sharing is minimalistic. I had no problems connecting this to a wireless printer / scanner, connecting to multiple wireless networks. I used google chrome to play netflix and hulu and they both displayed without skips or poor rendering. Google docs worked just fine. The screen and the mouse take a little getting used to but nothing that cannot be overcome.
This little jewel is just fine and dandy for short time use - despite the claim of over 3 hour battery life (NOT)!! My father used to always remind me - you get what you pay for.
I use the same laptop at work, it is very fast and works great for just about anything, the floppy is swappable with the cd-drive, the laptop is not heavy and pretty slim.  I think for the money thi is the best laptop available.  Internet just flies on it and I play a lot of online games on it and it work flawlessly.
I have this computer at work - and in the two years we have used it, the motherboard has gone out, as well as the hard drive.  Luckily, it was still under warranty both times we've had to repair it, but I would be nervous to purchase one as a personal computer at home.
Wow I am very pleased with this unit, runs great, handles all my tasks and is not heavy.  Thank you very much Advantage.
Well, i got this laptop as a gift for christmas, but somehow mine has slightly better specifications. Anyway, it works better than the other two computers in the house, which have faster processors and one of them is newer. It is so fast, and i can't even use up the 20 gig hard drive. It is great for watching DVDs on, because in full screen it looks like a high definition TV. The screen looks huge because most of the time you use it you are close to it and it is great. Windows XP runs perfectly on it. The only thing I am having a problem with is that it disconnects me from the internet every once in a while, but that is the router's fault. It also overheats very badly, but this isn't a problem for me. RECOMMENDED BUY!!!
Run, my friends, run from Dell's line of laptop computers. I've owned two of them -- one from the Latitude series and another from the Inspiron series. They've all had the same problems -- motherboard issues. As you may or may not know, motherboards are expensive, and in my case, the motherboard went TWICE in each computer.

My usage was light -- simply for business applications -- no gaming, no mega streaming audio or video -- just applications. And I see in the case of this model that you're getting 256 MB RAM -- you'll need at least 512 MB, or your computer will crawl between applications.

I know laptops will run hot -- but Dell laptops seem to run exceptionally hot. So hot that I had to park mine in front of an open window in January to cool down after 30 minutes of use. Perhaps this is why the motherboards in so many of their units bite the dust.

I've been twice disappointed with Dell products. As you can tell from the ratings on the Dell computers that show up here on Amazon, users don't have a very high opinion of them. And I won't get started on the whole Dell customer service aspect. It's well known that it's abysmal at best.

After the second laptop motherboard issue, I've learned my lesson -- and it cost me quite a few dollars. Hopefully they go back to the drawing board and redesign these things. Just be wary when purchasing a Dell product.
These latitude laptops are workhorses, I use 1 at work and it just kicks butt, also 3 of my family members own the same model and everybody is really happy.  Laptop is not heavy slim model and very very durable.  Overall a 5 out of 5.
I was quite pleased with my computer for the first few months- then things starting going wrong. Dell was reputed to have outstanding service, so I paid about $300 just for an extra long extended warranty. The service has been horrible and TWO replacements have broken down completely.

I'd go with just about any other computer brand, or at least not pay for a warranty that is essentially useless.
Dell sold me a laptop that was incompatible with docking station and stand; replaced docking station and stand but still didn't work.  Since this process took more than 21 days, Dell penalized me a 10% "restocking" fee and made me pay for shipping.  Took a great deal of time to even get them to take the system back.  Take my advice and stay away from Dell products.
A great machine.  The internet is very fast.  The quality of the video is decent and the sound that this baby puts out is above average for a labtop.
this is my second averatec,after the 3150.

screen brightness is improved,built in wireless is fine.

but be warned ,although it is advertised as 60 gb hard disk,

it only has a lousy 43 available.the rest is on an invisible

and unremovable hard drive partition,where the recovery software resides.this takes up almost a THIRD of valuable diskspace.and CANNOT be changed. There is also NO

recovery disk,and you cannot make one,because you cannot access the hidden partition.

i think this sucks.as i ,like many of you like my machine lean and mean! and want to make a clean install every couple of months

so be warned.

the rest works fine.
Have it 1 week. Looks and feels well made. Battery life 2.5 hrs.

Good value. No problems
I hoped for a lot more from this laptop. It looks decent on paper but it's a very poor performing machine. It is so fragile I am afraid to pick it up. It performs all the basics like surfing and basic apps but can't run too many processes at the same time. The video and audio quality are poor. It came with no recovery disks or instructions. I can't get a decent wireless signal no matter how close I get. The plastic case scratches easily. Maybe for $500 I would give it 3 stars. I am returning it before the 2 week trial period expires.
I purchased this computer only a short while ago, and it's already started to malfunction.  The power jack is not fastened down properly and the soldering eventually melts away, which makes it impossible to charge up the battery.  What's worse, Averatec offers absolutely NO customer support.  Nearly every other brand offers in-store repairs at big chain places like BestBuy and Circuit City, but not Averatec.  Instead, you have to send your computer across the country with barebones ground shipping for a month, all so it can have ten minutes worth of simple repairs.  Plus they erase your  entire hard disk, even though the hard disk has nothing to do with the problem.  It's absurd!  And if you call their supposed 24/7 hotline number, you'll get a busy signal.  Even the cheapest hotline numbers at least of an "all lines busy" recording.

The low price is enticing, but it's really not worth it.  You're bound to have some minor problem eventually, and Averatec's support and services are absolutely worthless.  I really regret wasting my money on this junk.
I've had several laptops, including brands like Toshiba, Compaq and HP... and this one has the same or more arguments to compete against all of them, but at half the price....

I've always been an Intel guy, this is the very first time I ever had a computer with AMD processor. Let me tell you that I'm falling in love with this one, because when I bought this little rocket, I still had my last laptop, a Toshiba with Intel Pentium 4 running at 2 MHz.... My new laptop beated the Toshiba in every way. First, it loads programs faster, heats way lower than the Toshiba and battery lasts one more hour...

I would recommend this laptop to anyone.... don't pay the double for a "premium brand", because the only thing you will get is that... the brand.
Good purchase, because it has the right price for my needs, while the similar like Sony etc, they are very expensive.
One of my several girlfriends wanted me to research a good notebook computer for her to buy.  The requirements she wanted reminded me of what she likes in her men.  It had to be powerful, play games, good company for DVD movies, not too expensive or high maintenance, look cute and last but not least perform.

Anyhow, during my research I decided I wanted a notebook computer of my own.  I do a lot of digital photography and editing in Photoshop and my old desktop just couldn't work with the current version of Photoshop (CS2) so I had to work with a couple versions previous to that.  My requirements for a notebook was at least 528MB ram, 60GB hard drive, DVD-R +/-, wireless card, a decent monitor, good brand, and most of all light.  I've had a notebook computer about 10 years ago and one of the main reasons I never lugged it around much was because it was fairly heavy - not that I'm a sissy boy or anything.

My research narrowed the selection down to a HP Pavilion 6000 or an Averatec AV3270.  The Pavilion was a tad more powerful but heavy.  The Averatec was just slightly slower but only 4.5 lbs - both looked very cool!  The Averatec won out and I placed my order for next day delivery.  Due to billing changes and the UPS man not waiting at the door long enough after a quick ring, I had to wait several days until arrival.  During those days, I wasn't too sure if I still wanted the Averatec anymore and was considering the HP again.  I'm so fickle - hence me balancing a multitude of ladies.

When I got the box, I opened the package and made sure I kept the insert between the monitor and keyboard.  It's very important because notebook LCD screens tend to get get indentations and scratches from the keyboard.  They even sell notebook monitor protectors for upwards of 10 bucks if you look around the net.

After turning it on, you get asked to register some products such as Symantec Antivirus and other stuff.  I just bypassed any registrations.  I popped in a DVD to make sure it worked and it did like a charm.  Second thing to test was the wireless connectivity.  I had just setup a wireless network the previous day and the wireless connectivity also worked like a charm.  Heck, it even got the neighbor's wireless network named "precious."  If she's female, I should drop by and borrow some sugar sometime.  I didn't have much time to play with the laptop since I was entertaining a lady friend that evening and had to go to work the next day therefore my playtime with the notebook was only a few hours.  I didn't want to customize the laptop too much from factory condition since I was still unsure if I was to keep it.  Overnight I decided to let the battery calibrate.  This took several hours as I slept.

The next day, I threw my notebook into the leather briefcase and drove to work.  At work, the first order of the day was to calibration the fan which took about 20 minutes.  Something still bothered me about the Averatec which was Windows XP Home edition.  I work in IT so having some components missing found in the Pro edition like remote desktop and other features had me itching to upgrade.

I still wasn't committed yet and didn't want to upgrade to XP Pro unless this machine passed one final hurdle.  I installed the latest Photoshop CS2.  Photoshop installed and performed better than I had expected.  I was concerned about the rated 1.6mhz and only 528MB RAM but it's true to the model number of the chip (AMD 2800+) - similar to that of a P4 2.8ghz.  Another deal sealer was running a program that converts RAW images from my Canon SLR to JPGs.  This little laptop is faster at performing functions than my IT desktop computer at work running a P4 2.4 ghz with 1GB RAM.  Of course, my desktop multitasks better because of more RAM but this laptop runs like a mini champ.

That sealed the deal for me to keep this AV3270 and I decided to upgrade to XP Pro that next morning after receiving the notebook.  I first crossed my fingers, downloaded all the drivers from the Averatec website, installed XP Pro, then installed each driver one by one.  It went without a hitch.

The next semi-major task was partitioning the hard drive since Photoshop and Windows likes a separate drive for cache.  I installed Partition Magic and now I'm working with a C:\ drive of 12GB for the OS and an E:\ drive of 40GB for data.  What happened to the rest of the Gigabytes?  I'm told it's on a hidden partition to restore this laptop to factory condition.  Unfortunately Partition Magic didn't detect it so I couldn't assimilate it for more space.

That night, I decided to test the wireless after meeting up with yet another girlfriend.  Around her neighborhood, I found several unsecured wireless hot spots.  I would just park on the side of the road and connect.  It's that easy though possibly illegal.  I didn't steal any credit cards or tap into anyone's computer or anything, just responded to some instant messges from my other women.

One thing I'm noticing with the keyboard is that it's silent!  It's great for taking to class if I ever decide to go back to school.  Also, I remember my girlfriend always getting angry at me if she heard me typing away on the keyboard while talking to her on the phone.  She had a right to be mad knowing I was flirting via instant message with other girls on the net.  With the silent keyboard, I can multi-task and flirt with a girl via phone and instant message at the same time!

Anyhow, to complete my test of all functions I needed to burn a DVD.  I have full seasons video of television programs filling up my desktop hard driveI burned 4.2 gigabytes of files to DVD over the wireless network.  Granted, it took just under an hour but I guess using a network cable would be better next time for faster transfer speeds to my notebook DVD burner.

PROS: light, speedy, respectable ram and hard drive size, slient keyboard, good wireless reception, dvd-rw +/-, good monitor

CONS:  keyboard kinda cramped especially number keys up top. I need to look at the keys more often than normal to avoid fat fingering.

TIPS:  I upgraded to 1gb RAM a couple weeks after purchase which made multitasking much easier.  This should also save battery power with less accesses to the hard drive.
I have used the Averatec 3720 for a bit over two weeks and I am more than pleased. Screen is very easy on the eyes and sharp even in the sunlight. At first when I compared the screen on this unit to other laptops with reflective screens, this one looked a bit washed out. But in practice, the reflected screens do exactly that - reflect alot. This screen is easy on the eyes, bright and sharp. The wireless is great and I have had no problems linking to wireless systems while traveling. The keyboard is fine as is the speed of the CPU. I have no complaints and highly reccomend this laptop. The fact that it was $699.00 at Staples was just icing on the cake.
This is the first AMD Sempron laptop I have purchased. I also have an IBM T41 Centrino laptop, and I couldn't tell much difference in the way of speed. The 12" screen is a tad small, and I noticed Averatec makes a 13" screen, probably with the same case since there is a sizable border around the 12 incher. Overall, I think this notebook is a good value. The build quality seems good, and I haven't seen any compatibility issues with the AMD processor. The DVD burner is a cool plus with this size notebook.

The one notable is that the screen has somewhat of a hotspot in the center portion, something I didn't notice on the 13" Acer I used to have, and the 14" IBM. Still, for a very portable computer, the screen is pretty good.
I just received the Averatec AV3270-EE1, and here are my first impressions:

I've uploaded photos of everything that was included, including screen shots of the laptop itself.

At first glance, it looks somewhat solid.  The casing, as stated by Averatec, is 1" thin, and made of magnesium alloy.  The outside of the case (behind the LCD) was a little scathed on arrival, not too noticable but nonetheless not something you'd expect in a brand new laptop.  The keyboard portion of the casing looks very sleek.  Because this is a 12.1" laptop, the keyboard is a but scrunched, though surprisingly not too bad!  The battery extends out a little in the back, but not too much.

There are 3 USB ports located on the right side of the laptop, next to the CD/DVD writer, with the power plug at the rear of the right side.  The 4-in-1 memory card reader is located at the front of the laptop, next to the latch to open up the laptop.  The VGA output is located on the left side, alongside the Modem/Network, and a PC Card slot.  To get a better idea of how it looks, view the images I have uploaded.

The internal wireless card detected my network instantly after setup.  It seems to be fairly strong compared to my wireless PCMCIA cards.  There is a button to enable/disable the wireless, located next to the power button.  Its a feature that is good to have, and can be found in many of the newer laptops today.

Sound quality is decent for a laptop, better than my old Dell laptop, but certainly not the best.

The screen is nice, but is somewhat difficult to see outdoors in sunlight -- too much glare!

This laptop is no speed demon.  However, it will be more than suitable for people using it for word processing, web surfing, and checking e-mails.

Contrary to the review by Hans Devente on May 15, 2005, the total hard disk size shown is 53.0 GB, and free space is 49.5 GB.  I have uploaded a screenshot.  But he is correct, there is no physical recovery CD, nor is there an actual Windows XP CD.

There was no physical product manual included; the manual is located on the desktop of the system in the form of a PDF file.  Averatec's reasoning:  within the packaging, it states that Averatec wants to be more environmentally friendly.

Included are several pre-installed software.  Cyberlink's PowerDVD/Power2Go/PowerProducer/Medi@Show, Phoenix FirstWave Recover Pro 2004 (Recovery Software), Apple iTunes, Apple QuickTime 6.5.1, Microsoft Works, Adobe Acrobat Reader 6.0, Microsoft Office PowerPoint Viewer 2003, Netzero Platinum, and Symantec Norton AntiVirus.  Upon the first bootup, several of these applications popped up asking to be registered.  Norton encountered an error, and stated that it should be uninstalled/re-installed.  This may just be an isolated incident.  Most, if not all, retail desktops/laptops come with a bunch of this "junk" pre-loaded.

Overall, the laptop has met my expectations for a sub-$1k laptop from a relatively unknown brand, and those expectations were relatively low.  For the price, I rated it 4 stars because of the issues I encountered.  For those of you that are looking for a cheap full-featured lightweight laptop, look no further as this laptop fits the bill.  However, if you demand the best, and have high expectations, look elsewhere.

Edit:  After playing with the laptop for two weeks, I have found the laptop to be a bit sluggish.  Slower than I expected, but it still gets the job done.
I was having trouble deciding between this and my IBM thinkpad.  Both were about the same height and weight but the Averatec has more bells and whistles and is about $1200 cheaper.

I am VERY HAPPY with the system so far.  Works great out of the box and battery lasts for a little over 2 hours when I am working on it.  It lasts longer if you are just watching a DVD.

Small, Light, Quiet, and packed with features.  Its worth it for this price.
I had been reluctant to adapt to notebook PCs due to the small keyboards and most laptops/notebooks are not really either small nor light.

I bought mine as if by love at first sight, beautifull siver, 1" thick and 4.5 lbs in weight, it stood out on the shelf.

The Averatec is fast enough so that you really won't miss ultra fast processing (wouldn't make sense to expect workstation or gamestation ultra speed in a notebook for the road) I would think.

It's a problem of definition, for me a "portable PC" is just what Averatec packages in the 3270, the best performance you can get economically.

With a 60/80 Gb HD, DVD burner, wireless card, SMALL and LIGHT frame, 2.5 hour battery, great screen, 512 Mb memory...

I watch DVD's, browse, work with Photoshop, listen to music and get asked frequently "what PC is that... for how much..?

It does perfectly well all that is not "extreme", but then again, how much extreme do you need..?

Makes me feel great.

I dumped my Toshiba Satellite and wouldn't pay 2000 bucks for a replacement, I tell you.

But got mine for $900.00 and got a $150 bucks rebate.

Need to have the fastestes or most expensive..? Don't look here.

Need a PORTABLE PC...?

Get an Averatec !
Great notebook! I had been hesitant given varied posted experience with Averatec, but this thing is solid.  I get about 3 hours battery life with wireless on, so the AMD Sempron processor does a great job with power management.  Speed is no problem for general use such as web browsing, Word, Excel, etc.  Case is magnesium alloy, solid and nice looking.  Wireless range is excellent with built in 802.11b/g NIC.  Overall, very happy.
Great machine but battery does NOT last long as I'd expected since this is a Centrino chip.
I was convinced this would be a great notebook.  Very good features for the price.  The screen is really quite amazing.  However, from the start, the computer feels a bit on the cheap side.  The battery jiggles a little in its housing, giving the whole computer a somewhat ramshackle feel... as if it is about to break... and lo, it did...  multiple times so far.  Sony really needs to work on the build quality.

I was happy for the first two weeks, then my problems began.

1.  2 weeks into owning it, the computer wouldn't turn on without a reset of holding the power button for 30 seconds.

2.  4 weeks in, the DVD-RW drive started to work intermittently, then not at all.

3.  8 weeks in, the power gave out completely.  The machine won't turn on.

Sony's in-home service has been OK (will have my 3rd visit this week), but waiting 2-4 days for service has been incredibly inconvenient.
I just bought my S460 last week.  I thought it got rather warm, but never realized how hot it got until today.  I was wearing shorts with my computer resting on my thighs.  After a few minutes, it was very uncomfortable.  When I moved my computer, I noticed that where bare skin had been touching the computer, it was bright red.  I decided to take my computer's temp.  Using am infrared thermometer, the lower right side of the S460 was 109.6 degrees.  That's hot.

I have yet to decide if I can live with this.
I just got the S460 a few days ago, and it get very HOT on the bottom of the notebook only on the right side. Whenever I type I can feel the underside of my hand warming up. I looked at a S350 and it did not have this problem. It really is quite annoying. It's going to cost me $270.00 to return this little oven. Do not buy this model.
i just got mines and i totally agree that it gets pretty hot.  i am worried that it is going to overheat and burn out like other certain laptops. i am going to try to return mine. any comments, please email me at candymcb@hotmail.com
This is a sleek and well designed laptop, Its amazing! Before buying this I read the specs (and reviews by experts) of many laptops. Also looked at it in 3D to get visual feel for it and others.

At 4.3 lbs LCD 13.3 inches 740 pentium centrino (1.73GHz)with a high tech NVIDIA card (128MB dedicated memory) and DVD+double layer writer .....you can't go wrong.

The size is perfect not too small and not too big. Cant fit neatly in your bag/ backpac.

It does get a lttle warm but its tolerable. It doesn't burn. Can still keep it on my thighs with no problem. Have no problem with the fan. Its amazingly quiet, but occasionally it cuts in or should i say speeds up to cool the laptop then gets silent again. Trust me , you don't notice the fan. Mine is in silent mode. As one review says , you can change the speed!

My only two regrets (but minor) are the battery life....I'm only getting 2 1/2 hours!!! and the battery fits slightly loose. Again its not a real issue, I'm just being a perfectionist here.

Secondly, I would have loved built in bluetooth. Settled this problem by getting the Zoom Bluetooth PC card Adapter. It fits perfect!

Performance of this machine is better than my Sony Vaio pentium 4 1.3 GHz desktop. This machine is FAST! Can't wait to see how it performs when I expand my memory to 2Gb tomorrow...will you you inform!!

No other brand of laptop comes close to producing the sharpness and life-like colour compare to  this sony vaio s460!

Oh Sony is lucky though that I didn't remove a star! The S460 is 5 star but I give Sony a 3Star for not providing a recovery disc...have to make your own. NOT KOOL SONY!!Also limited accessories...they only provide a power adapter. For $1899.00 come guys , give a least the recovery disc.

All in all, you can't go wrong with this laptop. Its beautifully crafted (makes others envious), its truly mobile and functional with great performance.
I just got the S460 a few days ago, and was really suprised at how HOT it gets on the bottom of the notebook only on the right side. Whenever I type I can feel the underside of my hand warming up. It really is quite annoying. It makes me not want to use the notebook as much!  I've been using a PCG-FX340 sony vaio that I got in 2001, and am really missing how it doesn't actually burn my hand as I use it.

The fan is noticeable. I'm still debating whether or not I should return this notebook!
I have to write a review even I don't have this particular laptop. As of right now I own the Sony S260 (older version of S460) with Pentium Centrino 1.6GHz, 60GB HD, 512MB RAM. Most people do not like this laptop because of 2 reasons.

1. A little hotter than other laptops

2. The fan runs more often than others

I think part of these problems because of the small form factor of this laptop. When Sony makes this laptop thin and small, everything needs to put it closer together so it will generate more heat than usual thus it needs the STRONGER fan and it needs to run more often.

I also own a giant Gateway Centrino 1.2GHz (6 lbs) and I can say that the Gateway is a little quieter (fan) than Sony but again it's a lot bigger than Sony. However, you can barely hear the fan noise from the Sony either only if you use the laptop in the quiets area or at midnight.

For the heating, the previous reviewer just exaggerates too much "This laptop gets heated up so much that you cannot hold it". If this is true, it's not the laptop, it's his skin and he needs to go to see a doctor. If the laptop is truly that hot, the plastic wires inside the laptop would be toasted already. I used my laptop 3 or 4 hours sometimes in bed while I'm watching TV. Neither my mattress nor my belly burns.

I give this laptop 4 star instead of 5 because I did not have the exact model but I don't see much of a difference.
Follow-up (2005/7/16):

After a month of using my Sony S460, I have to say that the heat problem is still bothering me.

I saw someone mentioned that his "S260" doesn't have heat issue and he believes people who have S460 exaggerate too much.  Before I bought my S460 I have checked many laptops available at local stores and none of them generates that much heat like S460 does.  Even the Sony S430, which comes with ATA 60GB hard disk, has a lot less heat on the right hand side than S460.  I asked the sales person about my concern and he believes that the extensive heat on the right hand side of the S460 is coming from the SATA 80GB hard disk.  I really doubted his comment at that time until I determined to find out why the right hand side of my S460 is getting that hot.  At first I thought it was the Intel wireless card since it's sitting at the right hand side.  It is easy to be removed so I took it out and turned on the notebook but the heat was still there.  I finally took apart my S460 and indeed the SATA 80GB Fujitsu MHT2080BH hard disk is also sitting at right hand side above the main board and Intel wireless card which is getting really hot after it is spinning for a while!

If you have different Sony S notebook or with different hard disk you heat issue may be less severe than my S460. But if you have Fujitsu 80GB SATA drive you definitely will feel the heat!

I also noticed that Sony has put a PDF file at their website with PARTIALLY correct info (256MBX2) on the S460 memory even though they still say 512MBX1 at everywhere else.  Still we're getting 333 MHz instead of 400 MHz DDR2 RAM as the spec sheet specified.

I hope people who have S460 and feel the heat on the right hand side is too excessive can keep calling Sony Support on this heat issue and pressure them to have recall on this HOT Fujitsu hard disk.  After all, even Sony admitted on their service bulletin: "Do not use the notebook computer on your lap for an extended period of time." And "Extended contact with the computer or adapter may cause discomfort."

---

I agree with "Amazon Fan" almost 100%.  I didn't believe what he said until I bought an S460 and tested by myself.  This unit is the "hottest" (temperature wise of course) notebook I've ever used.  As Amazon Fan mentioned, "this laptop gets heated up so much that you cannot hold it, the meaning of "LAP"TOP loses its meaning"!  (I guess that's why Sony call it notebook instead of laptop.) And I don't know how many people can withstand that kind of temperature on their right hand without wearing a glove.  Even Sony "admitted" this heat problem (got it from Sony Tech Support):

(...)
"Do not use the notebook computer on your lap for an extended period of time." and
"Extended contact with the computer or adapter may cause discomfort."

Another big issue to me is Sony's false advertising on their web site and putting inferior parts in this notebook.  The specs at their web site for all S Series (VGN-S430/S460/S470) on memory:

Memory - 512MB PC-3200 400MHz DDR2 (512MBx1)

But what I found that there are two SamSung's 256MB (333MHz according to BlueDemon) memory modules in my S460. As a matter of fact I've checked many S460's at local retail stores and they all come with the same 256MBx2.  This will prevent users to add more memory without throwing away some existing memory since both memory slots have been occupied.  And if you notice that Sony do charge ADDITIONAL $100 for a single 400 MHz 512MB memory module than two 400 MHz 256MB memory modules when you're customizing S480 and S380 notebooks.  This is a rip off by Sony and their tech support simply replied: "It's a misprint!"

Now I also believe Amazon Fan that "don't bet on Sony customer service, they will not accept that it is their fault".
In the category of ultra-portable notebook PC's, the VAIO S460 is a top contender.  I shopped quite a while before deciding on this model, watching the S series evolve from the S160, S260, S360, S380, and finally to the latest offering, the S460.  Let me get this out of the way first, the fan is not an issue and can be controlled through VAIO Power Management.  Yes, this notebook does get rather warm on its underside, but keep this in mind, it comes loaded with the same hardware included in notebooks more than twice its weight.  The newest generation Sonoma chip from Intel seems more responsive than my desktop running a P4 2.8 GHz with HT and 1 GB of RAM.

Good:

1.73 GHz Sonoma CPU w/ 533 MHz FSB

Dual-layer DVD Burner

80 GB 5400 RPM Hard drive

GeForce 6200 GPU (Great for even modern games,  Patiently awaiting BattleField 2)

USB 2.0 and Firewire

Keyboard Size and Tactile response and feel

Can't forget the amazing LCD

Size and weight

Price after rebates

Overall build quality

Sleek Design

Bad:

Battery Life 3hrs+ (Get the High Capacity Batt from Amazon)

Hidden Recovery Partition on the hard drive

Have to make your won recovery disks

No Bluetooth (Can easily add USB Bluetooth Adapter under $50)

RAM included is 2 x 256MB modules labeled 333MHz from Samsung - Upgrading to 2GB DDR2 PC2-4200 533MHz RAM takes less than twenty minutes and costs under $300, but involves removing the keyboard (Sounds alot harder than it is)
I don't really know what they are complaining abvout.  When the fan comes on in mine it is a very quiet hum, in no way distracting or annoying.  It does run a little hot, but so did my previous Gateway.  It perfroms great, and is extremely light and easy to transport.  To me, a great computer that is getting a bad rap because of a fan problem I don't even think exists.
There have been complaints about the fan noise.  On my unit when the fan is going full blast, it sounds about the same as a CD Drive on a Desktop computer.  Not terrible but I can see how it may be annoying to some people.

The other bad thing about this unit is that it will only accept Sony brand batteries, so if you want a high power battery expect to pay $250-350 instead of about $100.00 for an OEM.

What sold me was the high quality LCD display, the best and sharpest one I have seen, even though it does not compare with my desktop CRT.

Other than the battery issue, I would give this unit 5 stars.

I've been working with my new Vaio for three weeks now.  I was attracted to its sleek design, bright screen and portability.  I read the reviews about how noisy it is and how hot the processor gets.  I chose to ignore them because I wanted a sleek, cool looking machine.  And now I must suffer for my design sensibilities.  The fan is frustratingly noisy and it goes off every thirty seconds because of the heat the processor generates.  Incidentally, the review about it being able to burn a bare leg is spot on.  I haven't done it, but it's that hot!

It's a good looking machine but there must be others just as sleek but better designed.  Keep looking!  I'd return this but I can't deal with the hassle of back-up and restoring.
After extensive research, online and in person, it was clear that the VGN-S460 was the best overall match to my needs. After reading all the reviews with compliants about heat and fan noise, I made a second pilgrimage to see one in person again. This display model was running videos all day, and just wasn't hot enough to be a problem, so I bought one from Amazon.

I've just returned from a 3 week trip to NY, Mass., Maine and New Hampshire. The VAIO was used for downloading and storing 6-7 gigs of images from digital cameras, for online access using ethernet and Wi-Fi, for reviewing and editing pictures, as a map resource, etc. It performed flawlessly.

It does get pretty warm and the fan does run at varying speeds, but it never got hot enough to be a danger to itself or my flesh, although I put something under it when on my bare legs on a couple of very hot muggy days in Brooklyn. On the other hand, it is pretty cozy on a cool, foggy day on the Maine coast. The fan noise just isn't an issue for me, and I usually used it in very quiet environments.

The only problem I had was with burning my image files to DVD for backup. Sony includes some DVD writing software to do fancy stuff, but none I could find for simple data files. Picasa2, free from Google.com, turned out to be great, as it automatically indexes the images and will write backups to CD or DVD.

However, I was having trouble with errors in the copied files. After much time wasted, I bought some different writable DVDs. I don't know yet whether the VAIO DVD writer doesn't work with Memorex 8x DVD+R discs or if I got some bad discs, but Memorex CD-R and Maxell DVD+RW discs worked fine. Lesson - test everything before hitting the road!

As others have said, the screen is one of the best around, bright and sharp, significantly better than others I looked at. The keyboard is very good, with full size spacing and decent feel. All in all, a great machine. I did add 1gb of memory for image editing and other memory hog apps.

My previous notebook was a VAIO PCG-505, which I used for many years and still works as a secondary wireless web access, but the 300mhz processor and 64mb of memory were finally too small and slow. It would get very hot if left running on something soft and insulating, at least as hot as this new one, and could be uncomfortable on bare legs. And it's still running after 6 years.

I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the VAIO VGN-S460
Pro: Fabulous screen, great form factor

Con: Unbelievably annoying fan, unreliable, mediocre build quality

(note: I have the VGN-S260P - same notebook w/Pentium 735, smaller HD and only DVD-ROM)

Sony is the closest thing the Windows world has to Apple level product design. Unfortunately they always seem to screw it up with a few major flaws. This is the second slim VAIO notebook I have purchased (1st was a Z505) and it certainly will be the last.

The screen is truly awesome, brilliant and high contrast (although skin tones are not very natural for digital photo editing). As a side note, small bright letterbox format screens are surprisingly great for those of us with post 40 year old eyes that need bifocals - you get a lot of real estate yet you don't have to tilt your head back so far to read it. The overall size and weight are great and I find the keyboard and touchpad to be excellent - although I really wish it had an IBM style pointing device.

Unfortunately the quality leaves a lot to be desired. The plastic surrounding the keyboard bows up around the power button. I would have returned it for that but every one I looked at had the same problem and one look at the design makes it obvious that warping will occur. Mine also has a bad pixel (red one always on). Worse is the fact that after only a few uses I was on a business trip and needed to get some work done in the hotel - just as I was plugging a USB cable in it clicked off and went completely, totally dead. Sony service told me that they have had a lot of problems with motherboards dying on these. They also told me they had to wipe my disk clean losing all my data - why a dead motherboard requires that is beyond me. To add insult to injury, despite packing it very carefully and inserting a note to please be careful, it returned with a big scratch on the lid.

All of that would be forgivable if it wasn't for the most unbelievably annoying fan I have ever experienced. If it is on AC power there is NOTHING you can do to make the fan shut up (short of a bat). Even with the most aggressive power saving settings the fan will run - even when the machine is sitting doing nothing with the screen off! And it is not just that it runs - it is variable speed and yet it cycles on and off at ~10 second intervals, you can't imagine how annoying that is, it would be better if it just would pick a middling speed and stay on. But that is not all, the fan noise is not just the air moving, it is obviously a very cheap motor because the noise is predominantly motor/bearing noise of a character that after a few minutes drives you nuts and makes you want to go out and do something very antisocial. I have a new mini tower desktop (dual core Pentium) that sits 2 feet from me yet I can hear this laptop over it even though it is on a docking station at least 6 feet away.

The only redeeming aspect is the fact that if you set it to max power saving mode and run it on the battery the fan will actually shut off - as long as you don't do anything more than simple word processing. Unfortunately the performance goes down dramatically but at least you get pretty good battery life.

So if you're going to buy one of these get the big battery and a set of earplugs.
I was initially hesitant to buy this laptop because of the heat and fan complaints.  However I'm glad I did.  It does get hot, and the fan does turn on frequently, but it's nothing unbearable.  But then again I don't put it directly on my lap much.  What do you expect when you have a fast processor and graphics card in such a small unit.  I love the display (bright, crisp) and the build quality.  The size and weight are great except for the giant AC adapter.  My only really complaint is that the battery only lasts 2.5 hours, which is not great for a light and thin model.  Additionally Sony is proprietary with regards to parts, so it's hard to find a cheap extended battery.  Overall I very pleased though.
I have had this S460 for about a week and plan to return it because the right side is getting too hot and I can't put it on my lap for too long!  It's not the exaggeration like some people believe.  I think this heat issue is from my Fujitsu 80GB SATA hard disk which apparently is getting really hot as someone mentioned before.  People who don't have the heat issue could have different brand of 80GB SATA hard disk and I'd like to know if that is the case.

I also don't like the way Sony putting "incorrect" info on their web site for S460.  We should get 400MHz 512MB X 1 but in fact we all get robbed and getting 333MHz 256MB X 2!

And Sony is so cheap that the recovery CD's are not even included with their (expensive) Notebooks!
I love this machine. Fantastic performance and gorgeous display at 4.3 pounds. Power and elegance together in one. The reflective screen is a real plus as well. Longer battery life would certainly be an improvement (I get just over 2 hours playing DVDs) but that's about the only negative thing I have to say so far. As far as the heat I do not see this as being a problem. My machine does not overheat - it feels a bit warm on the right undersurface but by no means hot - compared to my Averatech 3200 the Sony is a meat locker (you can fry an egg on the Averatech). As for noise the Sony is silent. Another plus for this laptop is the speaker volume. You can actually pump the volume up loud enough to listen to the soundtrack on a plane or a noisy airport without using earphones - every other laptop I've used or seen you'd have to put your ears right up to the speakers even on maximum volume. Three cheers for Sony and 5 stars for this gem!
I got my Vaio S460 10 days ago, I've been playing around with it a lot and am very satisfied with it. About the heat issue, I kind of expected it to be hot after reading some reviews in this site, but to my surprise I found out that it is not that hot. Ok, it gets warm, but not being able to place it on your lap is an exaggeration. I have spent many hours with this laptop on my lap without any discomfort. I've read that most heat is produced by the video card GPU, and there is an option available for reducing heat production and fan noise by decreasing the GPU speed, but I bought this laptop because of the dedicated video card so I don't see myself using that option.

About the fan issue, it is not even an issue; it is not at all noisy. It gets on and off repeatedly but is not by any means annoying. The DVD drive does get noisy when reading some data DVDs but then again, it is not annoying.

The keyboard is just perfect sized, you won't have any trouble using it, the computer is really fast and the screen is awesome, very bright, I usually use it in brightness 6 when on AC power and in 3 when on battery to extend battery life. The laptop size is very convenient; I just get it in my backpack and I'm gone. It weights less than the books I used to carry around and it looks really sleek and fancy. I'm getting around 3 hours 30 min of battery life, maybe not the best around, but it is ok for my needs. The only thing that bothered me was to create my own recovery kit, sony should include recovery discs with the laptop.

So, it is a very fast, sleek and eye catching little machine, and I would definitely buy it again if I had to buy another laptop.
I see from the reviews here that one or two persons do not have a problem with the heat on the right side of the machine.  You must have gotten the two machines in the world that do not have the heat problem, so consider yourselves lucky.  I read the Amazon reviews, but thought "How hot can it really be?"  Well, the answer is "too hot."

I purchased mine July 15 and plan to return it.  I've used it on a flat surface so the vents have full access to air.  When typing and resting my hand on the machine, my hand can feel the heat from the right side.  It is warmer than any machine I've had (about 10).  I could get used to it I suspect -- especially on those cold winter days!  However, the underside of the machine is extremely and unacceptably hot.  It is much too hot to place on my lap.  I can only imagine how hot it becomes if used on a bed or some other way that reduces air flow.

So, traveling with it seems to be out of the question.  I like it otherwise, especially because I got such a good deal on it.  But, I'm forced to take it back.

In short, I wouldn't buy it unless you plan on never putting it on your lap and you plan to use a USB keyboard with it.  I'm going to try a Toshiba or Acer instead.

UPDATE:
I exchanged it for the earlier VAIO model S360 and the heat is not nearly as bad.  The only big thing I had to sacrifice in the exchange was the DVD burner; the S360 only has a player.
I thought I had researched this machine very carefully, but the one source I missed was Amazon. Big mistake as the reviews here predicted how I would react after buying. In most ways it's a terrific machine at its weight and price point. Unparalleled screen, fast enough, etc. But I feel "burned" in more than one way and will probably return it. First is the literal "burned" part. How anyone can find the heat level this produces acceptable is beyond me. I've measured temperatures of over 130 (one hundred thirty) degrees, more than others have reported. Heat builds rapidly when its resting on a lap or, for example, on the comforter in bed when I use it late at night. It gets so hot as to be unsafe. But once lifted and the vents on the bottom are able to get more air, the case disspates heat rapidly. Thus, it often gives a misleading sense of how hot it got while sitting on your lap. Someone with delicate skin could be burned by this thing and I think Sony owes us a recall. I suspect it must violate some consumer safety standard. Where's Underwriter's Laboratories when you need them.

The other way I feel burned was pointed out by a few other reviewers. Battery life is disappointing. In this day and age, under 3 hours is pathetic. Disk space is less than Sony claims. And the wonderful screen qualities are only present when running at full speed, heat be damned.

I really wanted to love this machine and I'm very disappointed to have to make these complaints. Maybe the heat is a product of the fast processor and slim design, but do other ultralights with similar power (and even slimmer cases) have the same problem? I haven't seen these complaints about other machines. I don't know what else to buy though.
After visiting my local Best Buy store we had narrowed it down to the Sony Vaio and had placed the order. I'm a very inpatient person so we had it send overnight. I came home only to be disappointed by some of the reviews I found online. Everyone rates this machine bad because it runs hot and the fan is annoying.

The reviews from consumers were quite distasteful in my mouth and I almost wanted to cancel my order for the Vaio. I must say I'm glad I did not cancel my order.

I love my new Vaio. As far as the notebook running hot; it doesn't run any warmer than my previous HP Pavilion notebook. Per the annoying fan; it turns on and off a lot but it's almost silent.

Other reviewers criticized Sony marketing this notebook as a notebook verse a laptop. What are they smoking? I use this notebook as a laptop on my legs for hours at a time and it doesn't cause me any discomfort.

I've never written a review before but I felt the Vaio received an unjust review by several consumers. Installing the 2GB memory upgrades only took about five minutes. Best-looking LCD notebook screen I've ever seen. Neat options and slick design.
Although I did not buy one from amazon, I have personal experience working with over a hundred T22's. This was a popular model among many corporations during the past five years, and now is being replaced with the newer T43 which has the P3-M/Centrino chipset. So many of these you are seeing for sale now are being retired from corporate use. One nationwide chain had a contract with IBM which would amount to at least 14,000 T22 Thinkpads in just their local offices across the US. My opinion of this laptop is that they are dependable and extremely well-made. Their biggest advantage, though, is their size which makes them great for travel. They each weigh in at around 5.5 pounds but seem much more compact than that number would describe. That being said, there are a few things to watch for and take note of.

Build quality of these models is excellent. I have a new Dell Inspiron 6000 that has many more features and a great LCD screen, but just feels cheap in comparison. The lid (screen half) on the Inspiron does not seem to latch evenly onto the base. So when closed, it wobbles a bit by perhaps a few millimeters. Every single one of the used T22's I examined did not have this problem. The Dell also has a flimsy CD/DVD tray while the T22's seems much more solid and heavy. All the compartments underneath, such as the battery and memory covers, seem to fit well and are easily removed.

The main thing to watch for on the T22 is pressure marks on the TFT screen, which will leave white or lightened spots on darker backgrounds. The screen can be replaced and is not terribly complex if you're skilled at taking things apart. The spec components can be upgraded easily and the CardBUS/PCMCIA will accept new WIFI cards, etc. A VGA-out is on the back so connecting a second monitor is easy, along with 10/100 Ethernet, modem, USB, keyboard and mouse ports. It also has microphone/headphone jacks, S-Video out, serial, parallel and infrared ports.

One point of interest on these laptops is that they do not have touchpads, only an eraser-nub pointer in the middle of the keyboard. Some users won't mind this at all and in fact you might get used to it quickly. The best option is a wireless notebook mouse like the one Microsoft makes which you can get here on amazon. The reason I prefer that model is you can fit the USB receiver into the underside of the mouse for traveling.

As far as Windows, I have not tested 2000 next to XP. Both will probably be fine. Make sure you look on Lenovo-IBM's website for a range of drivers/utilities if you want all the nice features originally built in to the Thinkpad. This includes the on-screen volume/screen brightness controls and the "battery maximiser" (yes, there's no Z). What that does is gives you details about the battery's performance, how many times it's been cycled and how healthy it is. Expect at least 3 hours from a good battery.

In summary, buy the T22 or spend 2-3 times as much on a slightly faster notebook that's of lower quality. Unless, of course, it's a new Thinkpad.
Hi, I am a 15 year old girl who enjoys spending her time on the computer learning about the latest technologies.

Right now I am typing on the very computer to whom I am writing the review. I have had this laptop for 3 weeks now. It is amazing. Since I am just a student I do not need any heavy duty power consuming software, everything I tell it to do it does with percision and exellence. Iam so happy I waited and researched this for a year and a half. Time surely paid off.

Everything I have is sony, so my computer works perfectly with my other gadgets. Sony overall is a great company and I certainly hope to purchase from them sometime soon.

This is an excellent laptop for students.
Great laptop.  Very pricy, obviously intended for people willing to shell out a few extra hundred dollars for a good looking brand name laptop.  It has shortcomings such as no built in mic, no external volume control, and lack of S-Video out.

However, I need this laptop for school, and those features mean little to me.  Battery life (I have the X-brite ECO technology, not X-brite) is 2.5-2.75 hours on full brightness, with wireless on, doing word processing and internet browsing.  I'd assume with wireless off and low brightness the battery goes beyond 3 hours easily.  I have the standard battery.

I'd attribute the extended battery life to the X-brite ECO v. the X-brite technology, it prob drains less battery life, and the screen is just beautiful, very vivid.  The laptop also looks great, why not get something that is pleasing to the eye when shellin out so many hard earned dollars?

I have 512 X 1 stick of Ram, so can easily upgrade to 1 Gb for smooth performance...you shouldn't need more than that.

Keyboard is phenomenal, no bounce, low depth of keystroke...trackpad is simple and responsive.  External USB mouse is a must...any good old USB mouse will do, nothing fancy needed.  I like the position of the three USB slots (good for right handed persons), they are on the right hand side...great for that USB mouse.

Speakers...not sure how they mach up to Toshiba's Harmon-Kardons...but they reproduce sound failry well, not hollow...but not too loud either.

Should be noted the FS series at the back has a gap between the screen and the base to make it looks nicer...I doubt this will break..but just be forewarned...it does add to its looks though.

I would recommend this product.  Try to get the X-brite ECO screen for the sake of battery life.
I've had this laptop now for 2 months.  Burns, cds and dvds with no problem.  Comes with lots of useful software and some not so useful software.  I love Sonic Stage for my music library.  Plays games like EVE Online, Lineage II, City of Heroes, and a list of others just great.  Nice thing is you can build your recovery disc set using cds and dvds then rebuild the laptop with just the software you want on it to relieve some of the initial clutter. I've heard some people say the battery life isn't what it claims to be but I've gotten 2.5 hours out of it, maybe longer. You must use the ultimate battery setting from the sony battery control panel to get this.  The only problem I've had with this was when I tried to run Windows XP Pro on it. Everything installed just fine except the onboard sound card wouldn't run under XP Pro and I couldn't find a driver that worked for it so I went back to XP Home edition that came with it.  I've had no issues whatsoever with its wireless setup.  I've traveled quite a bit since I've had it and have connected to dozens of different networks with no hassle whatsoever. I'd recommend this laptop to anybody looking for great performance and flexibility.
it is thin,light and has a quite sleek design, it is attractive.

I immediately replace the default 4200rpm toshiba hard drive with a 5400rpm 8mb cahce samsung. and the speed

is %50 up. The new 5400 drive is more silent than the old 4200 toshiba!

i also replace the default hynix brand ddr333 ram with ddr400 ones. default battery lasts max. 2 hours. I don't go mobile so no problem for me. but the others who are looking for something mobile you should buy the optional VGP-BPL2 extended battery. I had read some reviews of people who are mad about the default battery life. in my opinion, if this is a fact that reduces the price of this awesome notebook, it is a good option for a user to own a sony VAIO.

I also have a Toshiba M35X-S349 which is same with all specifications except the dothan CPU and 4x dvd-rw speed. and this sonoma 1.73 cpu is a little faster than dothan. xbrite screen technology is quite same with toshiba's trubrite screen tech. trubrite is a bit brighter than xbrite but xbrite view is a bit smooth than trubrite.

result: very good product for the price, awesome design and color, thin and light, fast and cool. don't think go and buy it.
This laptop is a good laptop for gamers like myself and for business purposes. The Wireless reception on this laptop is great. I own a linksys wireless access point and the signal from the laptop is strong even if i am outside the house. The only problem i have with this laptop is that the burning the recovery cds for the laptop was not successful. The burning process failed twice for me when i attempted create backp cds. This is serious since the laptop does not come with cds but all the software is backed up on 5 gigs of your harddrive. What good is it if it cant be burn on to DVDs. But other than that the laptop is GREAT!!!!!!!!!!

PS. Sony's tech support is excellent
I love teh look of it and the functions like teh s buttons made it easy and entertaining to use. it has all that i need but I would have like it more if i could upgrade it more.
Compared to the other Sony series, it is unbeatable. It has the perfect screen, keyboard, and weight. The S Series has too many cons including heat dissipation and the fan noise. If you want to buy a Sony laptop for a student or home use, get the FS660. The T Series is perfect for business but PLEASE stay away from the Sony S460. The S360 is better for heat reasons but lacks essential features such as dual-layer dvd burner.
SMALL, FASTER , EFECTIVE, I USE 4 ARCHITECTURE SKETCHES , DIGITAL EDITIONS, HOME MOVIES , AND EVERYTHING,HAVE NO TROUBLE TO "DRIVE" THIS SPECTACULAR "FERRARI" , SO BUY IT.

TNKS.
There are a few major drawbacks in this notebook:

1. The battery lasts for only 1.5 hour configured with the highest battery

  saving option (Lowest Screen Brightness etc.) while using only internet (no heavy apps) !!!

  I have tested it with many options but you don't go above 1.5 hours.

  The life span for these type of batteries are 500 cycles charge/dishcharge.

2. The Intel 2200BG Wireless Card which comes with this laptop and also other laptops

  such as DELL, have a major problem of a "Lost connection" where you get disconnected

  every 1 minute for a 10-30 seconds. You can search for this problem on GOOGLE and see

  that lots of people have this unsolved issue !!!

  Sony support was unable to solve this issue, Intel and Sony blame each other.

  I managed somehow to solve this problem after 3 Days, non-stop sitting with the laptop.

  The only way is to uninsatll the 9.0 version and download the 8.0 version from Intel

  and install both Software and Drivers from Intel and let Intel's software manage your

  Wireless instead of Windows XP.

3. The maximum RAM which can be installed is up to 1GB.

The bottom line, we are paying a lot of money for Mobile computing when we don't

actually get it in this notebook (both battery life and wireless).

Although I like very much the Design and the Display I have decided

I am returning this notebook !!!
Fantastic screen, weighs just over 6 pounds, good keyboard and fast!  The usual crappy touch pad (sorry, but I prefer a mouse) but any wireless mouse makes this the perfect desktop replacement machine. The only complaint I have is that all of the connections (USB, ethernet, etc) are on the sides of the machine. I would have preferred them in the back of the machine. All in all though - an excellent laptop for people who need high performance!
I did not buy this computer but I bought two VAIO PCG-NV before. Both computers became very sick (memory slot problem, dvd-rom problem, lcd problem, etc) just after the warranty expired. There is a sony service center in my city but I was not allowed to drop my laptops there. I had to pay the shipping fee plus more than $250 for each computer to be repaired. A few months ago, one latop suffered from the "motherboard" disease. I decided that it is not worthwhile to save its life. The Worst purchase I even made.
Just paid $40 for the recovery CD that should have come in the box. Come on , no user makes the recovery CD. Ever. Computer companies need to create the recovery CD. Put it in the box. Print a Manual. Put it in the box. The E-machine in the corner of the office came w/ a recovery CD. An E-machine. Thats a $400 dollar computer people. This VAIO is $1000 machine. No recovery CD.  But thats enough complaining. This VAIO Machine is very nice looking an the hardware is very nice. Hard drive can be removed easily for upgrade ,etc. Screen is excellent. Very thin but does not seem fragile. If you touch type, the area in front of the keyboard is a handy wristrest. Keyboard - eh, its a laptop keyboard. "B" key seems to be damaged. Sony's "download Taxi" is a decent way to get updates. Only Occasional issues w/ wireless dropping connection. Not a major issue. Sound isn't loud enough for me. It comes with XP Home. Should come with Xp Pro, upgrade it if you buy it. It is a fast laptop when set to "performance " settings. Turned off the powersave mode on the wireless. Personally I would not buy sony or toshiba. If you have this kind of money buy an IBM. INMHO , of course. The VAIO's price should come down soon and you may be able to pick it up cheap. Not a must buy but - try it at the store & you may like it.
saben me falta mis discos de instalacion de mi computadora nesesito el sistema operativo

I have had this laptop for about a year now, and I love it. Great performance, everything is great except for the battery. I sent it in to sony, they didn't fix it but gave me the extended battery for free, which is a 300 dollar value. Now I have 2 batteries, which is great, but I would rather have one that lasts for 5 hrs. If you need a good laptop, go with this, if you don't mind battery life :)
I didn't buy this laptop, but did buy a Vaio Laptop 2 years ago and have to say that their quality just isn't worth what you're paying for. I spent $3000 on my laptop and now  have to spend another $500 to get it fixed after only 2 years. The only authorized sony service center is over 100 miles away from me and I live in Los Angeles! And if it's that far from where you live you have spend money to ship it to them to get it fixed and their service prices are so expensive, you're better off buying a new laptop from someone else. So be very wary of buying a Sony Laptop. I've found it's really not worth it. I believe it's just the name you're paying for, nothing else. I think it's better to buy a $1000 laptop and then dump it if it has any real problems, which will probably save you money than to spend top dollar on a Sony and have to spend top dollar on repairs.

I'm a disgusted Ex-Customer of Sony.
I bought the 675PH model direct from Sony.

Sony should attach a letter of appology to every one of these computers. While it's beautiful, elegant and the screen is superb, the wireless on these machines is a complete joke. I have applied all of the updates to eliminate dropping connections (why should I even have to do this??), and this thing still performs like a pig. Slow doesn't begin to describe it.

I have a Dell 610 with identical Centrino and it is spectacularly fast. It's ugly, poor keyboard, but it works perfectly.

This Sony runs very well on wired connection, but can't a company of this size get serious about what customers think of their products and test them before shipping?
This laptop is very user friendly, and an enjoyable peice of equipment. The battery life is
great, as well as memory capability; however the price is too expensive. (...)
Before you buy a Sony PC you had best ask yourself the following question:

"If Sony is willing to distribute malware on their CDs, could they have done the same thing to the PCs that they sell?"

I would suggest not buying anything from Sony that has the ability to harbor or distribute any malware that they might call copy protection.  From their actions with the CDs it's obvious in my opinion that Sony is more interested in their content business (i.e. music, movies, etc.) than they are in protecting the good name of their equipment business.

There is an inherent conflict of interest here between the content part of the business, which appears to be willing to do anything at all in order to protect their content including putting spyware/malware onto their customer's PCs without their knowledge or consent, and the equipment side of the business whose goal should be to provide the best possible piece of equipment to the customer for the money.  Sony's actions, again in my opinion, have demonstrated that the content side of the business has the upper hand, and that I believe makes it dangerous to buy any equipment from Sony which could potentially be deliberately infected with the content side's malware.
The shipping was quick. I got it before the estimated arrival date. I'm very happy with the laptop.
IF YOU SERIOUSLY WANT MY OPINION ON BUYING THE FS-660,..I WOULD SAY , BUY IT,...(HOWEVER ..DO NOT GO FOR THE FS-640 )

I first bought the FS-640,.. but had problems with it,..like the speakers were bad, the processor speed was slow  the battery lasted only for about 60-70 mins,.and worst of all I had problems even playing CueClub,....

  I immediately exchanged it for FS-660,...and i'm glad i did it,..this is a great laptop ,..specially for students,..it is stylish( nobody can beat SONY,..). it has the nVIDIA graphics card to support your ram,(it may not aid an avid game lover,...but does a great job,)also...it has a better processor..

  however i feel SONY should have done a better job with the battery,...it barely gives an hour & half ,... and a lil more quality on the speakers would give a perfect 5.0

  ..on the whole i can give it a 4.5 on a scle of 5.0
For the price of this laptop it's unbeatable. It actually came with Windows 7 installed and not XP. I was a little concerned at first that it might have trouble running Windows 7 but so far so good. This is really just a back up for me and all I really need to do is surf the net, send emails maybe watch an occasional video. It's running great, surfs the net with good speed, boots up pretty quickly. The only thing that seems a little lacking is the battery life. I usually have it plugged in anyway so it's not a big deal for me, but I used it for a while last night running on the battery just to test out the life. Not terrible but not great. It lasted a couple hours before I had to plug it back in. All things considered, I am very happy with this laptop. If you are looking for something to use for simple applications and surfing the web then you really can't go wrong here.
Excellent product received very quickly.  I would buy this or similar products again from this vendor.  The software worked great.  Vendor even provide extra memory and larger drive.
Great product in (almost) mint condition, everything is functioning well so far and i'm more than glad l bought it. It was at a very cheap price so l didn't know what to expect, but l can't even find a flaw to point out; Even the delivery came earlier that it should have. I will definitely enjoy this laptop for a long time.
I have a T43 hooked up to my old school stereo. Playing music is it's job.
The T43p is faster. A lot of laptop for the price and a nice little work horse.
Thanks.
This computer does everything I need--surf the web, write E-mails, watch movies, create backup DVDs of data, and synchronize with my smartphone. The keyboard is great, screen is good and overall quality is very good.
Data sales co. is great.  They are very helpful and sell quality computers.  They are wiling to answer your questions if you will e-mail them.  The computer was received in new condition.  Everything worked well.  I am very pleased with this purchase.
I did upgrade the memory and replaced the hard drive although they were in good working order.  The 2668 is capable of running video for presenations with a good video output with memory.  It is a very nice computer.  Light and easy to use.
Getting ready to upgrade to Windows 7!
The item arrived super-fast, so I have no quarrels with that. However, the laptop was in worse condition than described by the seller: on the outside everything was nice and shiny, but I guess nobody bothered to dust the inside of the poor thing. It took me about 20 minute and two cans of compressed air to make it look "normal"; the laptop came with a few missing screws, so I had to buy those as well; it coms with Windows XP Pro, SP1, so you'll need to do ALL the updates in the past 5 years. Loads of fun...
All in all, the laptop runs great (once cleaned) and it was definitely worth its price.
I have bought several computers off of ebay. This blew them away. I needed a computer that ran xp for some old machine control programs I have. When I got this one, I was floored.  It looked like it was brand new.  Out of a 16 year old box, but brand new.

Trully impressive. I  will never waste my time or money on "Take a Chance" Ebay.

Thanks
Does what I need(Internet and e-mail).
The items description said it had a dvd burner and it didn't.
excellent product
I loved it but the battery life....well, HAD NO LIFE...RETURNED IT!
Bad..The laptop always is freezen..I could not sell it..
not bad
I love my thinkpad!  Bought it a year ago and still going strong.  It was a rebuild and they did a great job on it!
The fan makes noise. No spread sheet.
did not work
It was an affordable laptop for me. It worked ok for 7 months Unfortunately, the technology is out of date so that when it got a virus a few monts ago I've had a hard time getting it fixed. Someone is presently trying to repair it. I gave it to friend's ex wife to fix, but she never did anything with it so I had to see if I could get it repaired somewhere else. Had to go out and get a new one.
I love this laptop! I purchased it for work and it runs great, it does everything that I need it to do. The only thing I don't like is it is a little noisy at times. However for the awesome deal I got...I can ignore that.
I purchased this laptop in march 2010 refurbished from Datasales company. It is now 4 years later. After surviving more than a dozen falls  the Thinkpad keeps on Chugging along. I finally am replacing it because it was loaded with XP and microsoft quit supporting it. I have bought a newer model from the same company  with GREAT EXPECTATIONS.
Very good laptop works really good. Very fast no buffs or scratches looks like a brand new computer. Money was well worth it for this computer.
Found that using this notebook is very frustrating - freezes up frequently, very slow in processing anything. I guess I shall never buy refurbished/used due to this experience. I don't believe I've even saved money since there are brand new laptops out there for the same price, bummer :(
it good ok. but it didnot have xp pro on it. it has linux os.i just wish it was xp. like it said.
I ordered two of these and they both work great.  It's a good deal as the price was only around $150.  I recommend this product.
I love xp and bought this because that was the OS it has. It's a great little computer, actually. Cosmetically, it was perfect and operationally, although the hard drive size is pretty small and it's not the quickest system on the planet, it does its job just fine and now I can watch movies in bed on it. I'm a happy camper.
Laptop is broken, disc tray doesn't go in so I can't use the laptop for school as intensed, I am not happy
This laptop is amazing . If your looking for a good and cheap deal on a computer this laptops for you. With so upgrades and adjustments its amazing
the computer works as well as you would think a $88 computer would work, the cd player stays open on the side, so it is of no use. but otherwise I am very happy with my purchase.
The condition was good and the order arrived on time... the notebook had  plenty of storage. Fair graphics... Clear and big display.
I did not have any good affection for this item because since I received it I did not use it, it was full of virus and low memory, I requested a return label from the seller for replacement they replied me that they're sorry they can not send me a replacement because the laptop was fixed and setup good before they ship it to me. I am not very happy because it is like I trashed my money away, how can I buy something that I did not use and for the seller to replace to me and keep a customer they said no, I did not ask for a refound but it is ok, I will dump the laptop and God will be in charge. Thanks
I won't buy any other computers but Dell and IBM now.  HP's are junk.  So are Toshiba, Compaq, and that garbage Walmart sells (can't think of the name).  People look at it and say, "Time for a new computer, eh?"  I say, "Why?  This one hasn't let me down yet."  And except for when it has contracted a virus (ok, probably my own fault), this thing has been rock solid.
I purchased for a customer to use as a labeling system. Perfect for the use: relatively fast, everything worked and delivery was quick. I'm looking to buy more.
I will use this laptop as a information storage and retrieval system.  It is still powerful to do presentations.  Surprisingly enough It comes with win office, albeit ,an older version, but it works.  I.m impressed  .
only last 3 months, but not surprise since it was an old computer, hard disk needs to replace it + technical fees, i will just buy a new one
Hey for your money you just can't go wrong! This was a gift, and it so rocks! just do it!
every thing about this lap top was great the shipping was fast , it was packed very well,and it worked great right out of box and price was less than the cheapest tablet
the computer would not turn on even with a new battery and everything else. i was not happy with it!
This is a great product. Very light,can fit in my work bag. Worked perfectly and it came it as new. Sadly it was stolen at school but I will recommend it to anyone. I actually miss it.
I don't care if it isn't the most up to date. It does the job and does it well. It was sent professionally and worth every dollar. thank you!
Nice looking machine, but obviously nobody even looked to see if it worked before sending it to me.  #1 - It would not boot up in XP, just froze at every attempt.  #2 - the battery would not charge, as clearly shown by the indicator light.  I was able to fix the boot-up by going to Safe mode and running Defrag and Scandisk.  The battery problem was not fixable - It is simply defective.  Despite all the trouble, I'd still like to keep the machine, but there is no option to replace the battery only.  There's no "Contact Seller" button available for this transaction and all I am left to do is return it.  Whole effort - Waste of Time.  I Hate Wastes of Time!
I bought this for my two grade-school children to play educational mathematics games on line. I did simultaneously order a 1-gb memory card to increase memory size, which was easy enough to install (remove 512 mg chip by unscrewing hatch on bottom of computer; insert replacement chip. Done). That only added $12 to the total.
 It works fine for the limited tasks I want it to do. Cosmetically in perfect condition. Screen is in good shape.
 The one odd thing that caught my attention had to do with one software program that was installed, which I had not expected to be installed: PowerPoint. I was glad to have it, but there were a few fragments of old PowerPoint presentations still on the machine, from some business that had owned the computer before. It wasn't much, but usually refurbished computers won't have anyone's old data at all.
 Keep in mind that by current standards, the disk drive is small and the processor is slow. Still, my two kids love it. They had wanted a "real computer" of their own, and now they have one.
I was taken aback by the very good condition of the think pad. I will be purchasing more items in the near future
Wonderful laptop, works beautifully for me. I'm online all the time and its strong and takes it. I love the extra mouse option. Fast. And the touch sense mouse is perfect. I have tiny hands and the keypad is perfect. My only complaint is I wish I could download skype without it bluescreening. But I could always by softwear to help with that. :)
I've had this laptop for a while now and all I can say is "Wow!" It is a spectacular piece of machinery, it can take a hit and STILL operate with no problems. Never been through a hard drive with this thing, always reliable and ready. Best laptop that money can buy!
This device was a let down due to the problems in upgrading the hard drive. Do to buy this type in the future.
Jason at datasales.com demonstrated the best customer service available. We ordered this laptop, and had it for about a week before we realized there is no sound. So I called him, and without blinking an eye, he offered to send another laptop -- that he wanted to make sure there wasn't a problem, and that the best solution would be to send us another machine. He did this within two days, and now is paying for the shipment of the first machine back to him. A good guy. Totally recommend. the laptop is nice. chunky keys. love it. Not a lot of memory (which doesn't matter because we store things on an external drive), but fast enough for us. And for less than $150!
This is great it fits my office space perfectly and has more disk storage than I'm used to...This was a good buy
OMG!! this is the best computer for the price.  If you have children that need a starter computer this is it.  I mean it works great t for everything but is doesnt have the newest operating system.  It is also a great computer to give to your older parents that are not computer users.  It is a great deal.
This is a good laptop for school.  I doesn't come with any Microsoft office items or games, but was easy to install. Short battery life though.
I ordered this so some of my older programs would continue to work.  I have ancestry program (2006) that I find is very user friendly with XP and is not supported by windows 7 and I am sure not 8.  (Although it works on 7.)  I was going to send back, but changed my mine.  I wanted the challenge to get it to work etc. The hard drive was working but needed to be replaced, so I installed a new one.  Had the entire machine checked out, and everything else checked out fine.  The place I took it to re-installed the OS system and I did the rest and was good to go.  All in all it was less than $200 for a back-up computer for my research.  I love it.
What a great deal! Although this older model runs slower, you can install up to 2gb of ram, its perfect if your a student and don't care too much for watching you tube or netflix! You have to install microsoft office on it, it only comes with word pad.
This suck I purchase mines and when I try to use it it says operating system not found it be nice to know that I am real disappointed with this purchase I think I want my money back
I would give this IBM ThinkPad T43 a 10 Star if they were to give it to me! Using it now. I immediately upgraded to 2 GB Ram.

I also bought more Caddys and 3 more hard drives. I have purchased about everything that is available for this ThinkPad/

Do Not buy the cheaper UltraBay hard drive sled - JUNK!! and you'll fight with it going in and out. Buy the IBM, do yourself a real favor!

You can go to the IBM website for this ThinkPad and download all of the software and BIOS Upgrades for this laptop.
Originally the BIOS is Version 1.0 or 1.09  There is a Version 1.29 which upgrades the BIOS to  a 2009 model year.

The last year for this laptop was 12/2005

Would I buy one again? you Betcha! Mine has the 128MB Video and is the 15 Inch monitor! I use this laptop more than my three Desktop PC's which are way more powerful than this laptop. But the Laptop is so Handy!

I paid I thin $130. and is worth every bit of it - this one is an Off-Lease. I don't think it was used much by the Leaser. It looked new when I got it.

I have been running a 40 GB hard drive with Linux Mint 14 and love it! Ubuntu is okay, but there are a lot of not well thought out stuff and some things don't work where as Linux Mint, it does! I have found a few other Linux distros that work very well with the Laptop too.

I am looking at buying another T43, yea! I love it that much!
I'm tempted to award five stars, but there are a few issues with this very good and affordable laptop.

First, don't believe the Technical Details data on the 802.11 Wifi. I got mine from U.S. Micro and couldn't get the wifi working. An email from their tech support stated that they check their machines for wifi card being installed before they ship, but sometimes they forget. I got one without the wifi circuit card, and they promptly replaced the laptop with another that did. Just remember, Amazon's T43 web page indicates wifi as being a built-in feature, but it is NOT. You need to check with the seller before you buy. Also need to make sure it comes with the correct driver installed, otherwise you'll need another computer to download it. (note: according to U.S. Micro, there are two possible wifi cards, the IBM and the Intel. You need to install the correct driver for your particular wifi circuit card)

Who knows what else might be listed as a standard feature, but isn't really? I can't tell yet; everything else seems to work okay so far on my machine. The T43 can come in various configurations, and it comes in two different screen sizes (14.1 inch and 15 inch).

This laptop gets pretty hot after 30 minutes or so.

Two USB ports is a little skimpy for some people. Consider a USB hub, or the T60/T61 which has three USB ports. Other than USB, has oodles of I/O ports, even a good old-fashioned IrDA for hotsyncing my Clie and Handera PDAs.

Otherwise, this is a reliable and solidly built computer. Good performance even being some 7 years old. A champ! (never imagined I'd be calling myself an IBMer 30 years after the 5150 PC displaced my beloved TRS-80 Model 4 as the reigning Best Computer In The World)
I love this hardy little computer. Now, if you're looking for something sleek and futuristic this laptop is not for you, but if you want to listen to music, stream videos, do some word-processing and browse the web this computer is perfect. The wireless also works great. I can't believe it was under $200. It was worth every penny. I bought this when my HP laptop crapped out. It was a little over three years old. I can't afford a new computer right now and needed something just for those basic functions I listed above. The computer's old so the battery doesn't really hold a charge. It's also not the lightest so I don't leave home with it very often. It runs Windows XP, so you can't install some recent and complicated software (ex. I couldn't install the software for my Zune mp3 player, but I had no problem with Spotify). These are the only minor complaints that I have. The only thing that I wish it had is a webcam, but that's not a big deal. I don't really Skype that much anyway. This laptop gives you more than enough bang for your buck. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a cheap and simple machine that they're going to mostly keep in the house.
I received the laptop in a short period of time. The unit was in great shape and works just as I would expect. I am very pleased with the purchase and would suggest it to anyone.
Received with an extra gig of memory and worked great except the cd/dvd combo drive which the seller sent me a new one that worked fine. The cpu fan cut out sometimes so the seller sent me a new one. The screen is excellent for web browsing and playing games. Very fast for an older computer. Highly recccommend.
Product arrived quickly and works as guaranteed. I almost spent $400 on a piece of junk from a box store. For $130 I got a better laptop, and the thing is built like a tank. Fantastic -- one of the best purchases I've ever made on Amazon.
I can't find enough technical details to base a decision to buy the product.  Have Tech's write the specs, not sales geeks.
I use this laptop for my weather station software, so it runs 24/7 and it is on Wi-Fi Network.  I did  place cooling  pad under the unit to keep cool for 24 hr operation. My unit came with extended battery which worked great after suffering two 45 minute power outages. A refurbished unit that is well worth the cost.
So it isn't sleek and streamlined like your modern laptops.  Not like I plan on racing the thing.  I do find the black matte metal case incredibly appealing, like I could run over it and it would still work, or perhaps use it to bash apart a fancy new laptop.

The main reason I bought this computer was because I needed to free up some hard drive space on my PC so the games had to go.  I got a free memory/hard drive upgrade with my ThinkPad so I've been merrily cramming it with resource-hog games and they play loads better than I'd expected.  I may load a few graphics programs to see how well they work.

Like older laptops it does get quite hot which makes the DVD/CD drive a bit cranky sometimes but my last desktop PC did the same thing so I can deal with it.  The fan is a bit loud but not distracting.  I probably have the original battery because it's only good for about two hours but since I normally use the power cord anyhow it hasn't been a problem.  I may order a new battery if I start carrying it around.

Big "meh" on the nipple mouse.  I haven't gotten the hang of it and for the moment it's disabled but I'll give it another go since it is staring at me with that baleful red eye.
IBM Thinkpad was purchased for emailing and surfing the Web.  But there is so much more that it does.  The price was unbeatable and the purchaser was very good.  I had a question and I called the support line they provided and they were very responsive and helpful..  Definetly worth the money and more
This is a great laptop for the price! I got it for my music and to watch movies on and it works great for both. I also like that the keyboard keys aren't stiff like other laptops i've used; it makes it much easier to type :)
had it for a week now, for less than 200$, it worked great.i installed windows 7, arrived with 1.5gb ram, so it operates all tasks as net, office and movies. everything works well
1st, let me start by saying, I've never really been the biggest fan of laptops in general but for this I have to make an exception. Windows XP will always be BETTER than all other operating systems. Yeah I said it! From my experience with the more advanced windows such as windows 7/Vista they have always been too faulty with all sorts of random errors: Slow starting up, Trouble/Slow connecting, freezing, blank outs screens, the list just goes on & on. So random, Its annoying. I find that they over-do it with the more advanced systems, I really don't think most laptops are designed to handle all that. I much prefer this in Windows XP(Pro)! I find its more concrete, more sturdy, & I can turn them on with no surprises waiting for me. I have had very few troubles with it so far: Its fast, large screen, nice to look at, reliable, easy to customize. It even connected to my wireless internet right away & with no prompt. The battery life is decent as well though I always keep it plugged anyway. The only problem is this tea kettle whistling noise the battery occasionally makes when plugged but I hardly notice it most of the time. This is a win win for me in terms of price & quality esp since I find this better than any of the more expensive brands. What a Steal. Ofcourse the RAM, Free space & Memory is pretty small but that doesn't matter for me since I don't plan on downloading or saving much of anything at all. I'm sure I'll have to be very careful with this thing. I just hope the computer never crashes on me, that's my only concern.  But good so far. Highly Recommended it. :)
The laptop was an used, dusty computer. It is working. I did not returned it, but it was not what the vendor offered.
I REALLY LIKE THIS COMPUTER. VERY INEXPENSIVE AND DOES AS WELL AS MORE EXPENSIVE COMPUTERS. I HAVE APPLE iMAC COMPUTER AND EVER SINCE I RECEIVED THE IBM THINKPAD 14 INCH NOTEBOOK COMPUTER I USE THIS COMPUTER MORE THAN MY 20 INCH APPLE COMPUTER. IT IS VERY EASY TO USE. I THINK IT WORKS FASTER THAN MY APPLE COMPUTER. THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE IS I CANNOT GET TO WORK WIRELESS,MAYBE IT IS ME. I WOULD SAY THIS COMPUTER IS A VERY GOOD BUY!!
Stable, fast and well designed. The iBook is a bit more money than the Windows based laptops, but, Apple stands behind their products with good support. This is being used for my daughter in high school and she loves it. Airport network connection was a snap. This is a great product.
This is my third Apple laptop and am pleased by the ease of use and the features included on this computer.
After having my Dell laptop replaced 3 times in 2 years I decided to ditch the PC and switch to a Mac. Its been three weeks, and I could not be happier. This is an amazing computer, easy to use, well built with quality parts, and really cool looking to boot. There is no comparison between any other computer manufacturer, the iBook looks and feels sturdy. In addition when you call tech support you actually speak to someone who speaks English. Buying a Mac is worth that little perk alone. No more waiting on hold for two hours only to speak with someone who doesn't understand you and cannot even help you.

Switching to a mac from a PC was not as bad as I thought it was going to be. If you live near a Mac store go poke around and speak with the employees, they are a lot of help and can ease your transition from a PC. The only drawback is the lack of a two-button trackpad, but that is a small price to pay for a computer that you know will turn on every time you press the power button, plus the new might mouse has two buttons. No more blue screens of death telling you that your computer is doing a system memory dump.

If you are looking for a computer that just works and works well, get a mac.
Now that I know that we (I) are stuck with OS X for better (mostly) then a new Mac is the only way to go. There are many things this low-tech Mac pilot likes about all things Mac, but the loss of some really fine features by the intro of OS X is hard to take. NOt being able to just go into a "Control Panel" and uncheck an unwanted program for example, or knowing how much you are dumping in the trash for another. The idea of "crash proofing" the system IS a good trade off I will admit, but sometimes I wish the programmers hadn't been so quick to do away with the easy to use stuff just to create a NEW AND BETTER SYSTEM!!!! Sometimes the price of progress is a bit steep. That said, I wouldn't touch a PC with a ten foot firewire cord, so I'm happy to have a SuperDrive and all the other goodies the iBook has, though I really doubt I will use half of them. iPhoto is a cute gimmick, but I prefer Photoshop, iTunes are nice to have, but with a dial-up causing all things like this to load slowly and often, I'm just not going to get into it. And there's not that much worth listening to on radio......and etc., etc., etc. STILL! even a curmudgion will like an iBook. This one does.
I had mixed thoughts about buying a IBOOK.  Apple computers have always had a great reputation, but do they live up to expectations?  Are they as good and as compatible as they claim to be?

I bought my IBOOK 14" in Mexico City, but it is the same model as the U.S.A. model.

Technical specifications:

- iBOOK 14"

- 1.42 GHz PowerPC G4 Processor

- 1 Gb of RAM (I added 512Mb)

- 60 Gb Hard Drive

- Super Drive (DVD & CD burner)

- English keyboard

- Bluetooth and Wireless Internet (Airport Extreme) included

- MAC OS TIGER 10.4.2

OPERATING SYSTEM

It's a breeze to use.  You take a bit of time (about 3 days) to get used to it, especially a ONE button mouse and the shortcuts with the keyboard, but it is very nice, very stable.  I've had the computer for a week, no problems in that time.  No freezing, no crashing, but a lot of rebooting for new or updated software.

SPOTLIGHT, and instant finder of files anywhere in your hard drive, DVD/CD bay, IPOD or connected devices is fantastic and easy to use.  On the other hand, the very celebrated DASHBOARD (widgets in your desktop like clocks and maps and calculators) feels and looks very cheap.  Yahoo! Widgets are much better and are available for APPLE and PC computers.

SCREEN

It's bright, bright, bright !  Looking at it from different angles does not give you a very sharp and contrasted image, but right in front of you, it has incredible colors.  TIGER OS, also has incredible and elegant wallpapers and icons that are a joy to see through your screen.  14" is good enough for me.  If you read something about "fuzzy text" in other reviews, it is true; compared to my previous laptop (Sony VAIO 15" monitor) it is fuzzy, but it isn't too much and won't notice it in a couple of days.

Best of all, the screen came with no dead pixels.  Excellent quality.

KEYBOARD

It has a very nice feel to it.  It is soft but yet sturdy.  I have it configured in Spanish and can type the characters "" and the accents "'" easily, no need for silly "apple+n+n" combinations or "apple+e+vocal".  Underneath the keyboard you will find the extra space for an additional RAM memory module.

HARD DISK

Announced as a 60Gb disk, it really has a 55.5Gb capacity minus the pre-installed TIGER OS, which leaves around 42 - 43 Gb of free space.  FORTUNATELY, I have seen that Apple software (Office, Adobe, Macromedia, etc) are made in VERY small files (Office 2004 is only around 250Mb big), so you will have PLENTY of space (30 - 35 Gb) free when you have done installing quite a lot of programs.

Games, on the other hand, do take a lot of space.

RAM MEMORY

I heard that 512Mb were enough, but several people got me convinced on getting an additional 512 which cost $170 USD here in Mexico.  It does better performance and allows multitasking (I use Excel, Fire Instant Messenger, Safari Web-browser, Itunes and posibly Adoble at the same time with no lag).

The instalation of the RAM can be do-it-yourself and it is easy (I was very frightened at first, but found it easy enough).  The computer recognized the new RAM memory right away.

CD/DVD

I have been able to read copied DVDs in this driver which I haven't been able to play elsewhere (I'm sorry, it was a present, but say NO to piracy).

I have only burned data disks so far, but with TOAST 6.0 Software (not included out of the box) it was a breeze and the burn rate was very fast (around 600Mb in 4 min).

DVDs look OK, but they lack a LOT of crispiness and contrast.

CDs sound great !

SPEAKERS

They are small, have no bass, but sound good overall.

AIRPORT EXTREME

Thank goodness this is standard now.  I picked up wireless hotspots easily and manage to connect in a few seconds.  I have not found it to be as powerful as some people say.  It still can't get a decent signal through to concrete walls, but one wall  gets you a nice signal.

BLUETOOTH

This thing is awesome, if you have a cel phone with camera and bluetooth connectivity, you certainly want to check this out !  It connects easily and fast.  I had my strange format videos from my phone in the my hard drive in no time and playing in Quicktime (format .gp3, who knew?)

BATTERY

Just as promised.  If you use non-demanding software and no CD drive, you will have around 4.5 - 5.5 hours of battery, which is GREAT.  They other day I installed software using the CD drive and had it in "maximum performance" and still the battery lasted for about 3 hours.

The option of adjusting the energy consumption through processor performance is great, so you can set it to "low consumption" if you are doing internet only or "high performance" if you are doing heavier stuff.  Also dimming your screen brightness and deactivating Bluetooth and Airport Extreme will result in longer battery life.

PROCESS0R

It's not lightning speed, it seems quite as fast as my old Celeron 2.4GHz (aprox. Pentium IV 1.7 Ghz), but it does the job.

VIDEO MEMORY

I have seen no problems with this.  Although I do not do image rendering or design, my Astronomical software has had no problems with this.

CASE

It is a beautiful case, the white is astonoshing and the lit up Apple behind the screen is just way too cool.

Yet, NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO, it will sooner or later get scratched.  It is up to you how much you take care of it and how deep and common will your scratches be.

OVERALL:

I have used the computer for too little, only one week, yet I believe that going back to Windows is a big NO NO.  This system rocks, it's easy to use and stable.

The goodies offered are great and at a fantastic value.

The battery life is awesome, yet the disk space could be bigger.

2 USB ports, 1 FireWire 400, 1 DVI video (strange format) seem to be enough considering that you have bluetooth for new-generation mouses, printers and extra keyboards.

Office's Excel in spanish has proved to be quite annoying.  The decimal point separator is a "," instead of a "."  This is the way Spain uses it, but not the rest of LatinAmerica and there is NO WAY OF CHANGING THIS PREFERENCE.

Tiger Operating System has proved to be compatible with (almost) everything, why not switch now when the price and the hardware are correct?
I am a recent PC/linux user who got sick of linux and wanted something UNIX-like that offered more real support for hardware/video/etc. than linux did (LINUX doesn't quite work right on a lot of different hardware configurations), as well as an easier interface.  So I decided to get an apple computer, and the next question was should I get an iMac G5 or an iBook G4 -- both are about the same price.  I was initially leaning towards the G5 because I was afraid the G4 1.42 GhZ would be wimpy performancewise, but on the end decided I really wanted a notebook.  I must say I'm quite happy with the performance of the G4.  I wouldn't recommend trying to run something like Madden 2006 (yes, I know it doesn't/won't for a long time exist on MacOS, but you know what I'm getting at) on here,  but it does well on games that aren't quite so cutting edge (eg. Warcraft III, or SimCity 4).  The OS is quite stable and the battery lasts a nice long time for me on here.

If you're a PC user, you'll find that you'll have to shift your thinking as to what meta keys (i.e. keys like shift, option, control) you need for a given task, but this is only a minor obstacle.  Unless you are really into high-end gaming and graphics, more important than obsessing over processor speed is to have a good, solid OS that doesn't crash on you and that is easy to use, and the iBook fits both bills.  Things like more memory and HD space are easy to add later to extend the useful life of your machine.  If you do want really high-end gaming and graphics, then even the Powerbook (which isn't all *that* much better than the iBook, but is a lot more expensive) won't be good enough, and if you want a Mac, you'd have to get one of the G5 desktops.  Also cool is the built-in microphone, and a chess program that allows you to give moves verbally.

I only have two complaints: 1) The SuperDrive seems a bit too finicky about scratches on DVDs -- the iBook complains vigorously about a DVD (to the point where it gives up altogether) at a given point, where, on my other computers (including other laptops) pause for a second, figure out what to do, and keep playing.  2) Trying to do system-config tasks seems a bit harder than it needs to be -- for example, if I add something to my "keychain" (something like a "memory" of certain settings), I can't figure out how to get it out of the keychain.
I've been a PC user all my life but decided to go Apple after hearing so many rave reviews from friends.  Keep in mind that I was a master of my PC (with all of the shortcuts and tricks), aIt may just take time.  Here are some initial comments after a few hours of playing around with my new iBook:

Pros -

Easy setup!  took minutes to get the system running and updated!

Beautiful machine - as much as I have always liked it, owning one feels different

Cons -

The screen does not open a full 180 degrees.  Often I like to sit with my knees up and open my laptop completely flat, but this is not possible with an iBook.

ctrl+arrows do not skip you over words if you are trying to navigate through a document (I use MS Word ALOT).

Even though it comes with a 60GB, 20 GB was already full from programs and the OS

I'll continue to update and add to this review as I learn more...
First things first. I have always been a loyal apple fan. Even before the whole ipod craze began, and Steve Jobs began to drive this company out from the shadows, I was dazzled by the ease of use that all apple computers offered to users. With the purchase of this ibook, however, all of my feelings about Apple's computers were reiterated and magnified.

I feel that this review would be more meaningful if a comparison was drawn between the ibook and a similar high-end laptop offered by Dell (the Inspiron 600M Celeron) Please note that this is not a true comparison because the Dell Inspiron 600M has a 1.3ghz processor while the ibook (14") has a 1.42ghz processor.

The Dell Inspiron 600M at a price of $1,623:
1. Processor: Celeron M Processor 350(1.30 GHz)
2. Memory: 768MB DDR SDRAM
3. Hard Drive: 80GB
4. Optical: 8x CD/DVD burner
5. Monitor/Video: 14.1-inch XGA 32MB video memory
6. Wireless: Dell Wireless 1470 Internal Wireless (802.11a/b/g, 54 mbps), bluetooth technology
7. Software: Windows XP home edition, Microsoft Office Small Business (including outlook, word, excel, and powerpoint) *note: office is an add-on and does not come pre-installed
8. Service: 3 year limited warranty

The Apple Ibook at a price of (vis-a-vis my parameters) $1,653:
1. Processor: PowerPC G4 1.42 GHz
2. Memory: 768MB DDR SDRAM
3. Hard Drive: 80GB
4. Optical: Superdrive (DVDRW/CD-RW)
5. Monitor/Video: 14.1-inch TFT 32MB video memory
6. Wireless: Airport extreme card (802.11 b, 54 mbps) built-in bluetooth technology.
7. Software: Mac OS X Tiger, ilife (including itunes, iphoto, imovie, garageband, appleworks and more) iwork (including pages and keynote) *note: the full version of iwork does not come pre-installed; you only get a 30-day trial version.
8. Service: Applecare warranty and service/support

So there it is. I know what you are probably going to say: "Oh. The Dell is cheaper and it has more memory." What about the processor speed? I know that 1.42 isn't much better than 1.30, but this is dell's low-end 600M. Even the low-end ibook has a faster processor (the 12-inch with 1.33 ghz) Also, the price difference is mainly due to shipping, which dell offers for free on top of the 34% discount that you get on the laptop.

Another thing about the dell 600M is that you have to add-on all of the software, security and wireless capabilities.

Looking at the software, you have to purchase Microsoft office in order to attain the same degree of productivity that you can get with ilife on the ibook. (Which comes pre-installed by the way). Iwork, however, is not pre-installed but I would suggest that you purchase it ($49 extra) if not for keynote. Keynote (apple's version of Powerpoint) blows it's opponent right out of the water. Here's just a quick summary: with keynote you can enhance slides with animated text, layered images, and transcending builds and transitions. In short, it makes Powerpoint look like freeware.

Turning to wireless and networking capabilities, the ramifications of both the systems are basically the same. But the set-up is not. To begin with, the specified dell system doesn't come pre-installed with a wireless card like the ibook does. You have to add those on. Second, the ibook comes pre-installed with bluetooth wireless technology, while the 600M doesn't.

Networking and Security: AirPort let's you take off

Security is another feature that comes standard with apple (considering that Tiger is a much more secure operating system than windows). Right out of the box, the apple ibook offers configuration while with the 600M, you have to get tons of software to protect you from spyware and other potential security breaches. The apple airport extreme system features a built-in firewall to protect the end-user from hackers and potential thieves offering password protection and encryption technologies.

Another great feature of the apple ibook is that Mac OS X has a network autosensing feature which detects the fastest network available to you, all the while automatically configuring your computer for network activity. Wave good-bye to manually setting your wireless settings.

ITunes
Of course the whole driving force behind apple's success as of late has been the ipod, itunes team. With the purchase of an airport express (sold separately) you can use your built in AirPort card to wirelessly play your music through a home theatre system or any other audio device in your home. All you have to do is plug your speakers into the AirPort Express Base Station and the rest is music to the ears.

Widgets
Another handy feature of Mac OS X tiger, "the most sophisticated operating system in the world", is the ability to use mini-applications called widgets. There are over a thousand of them and each are unique. My favorite one is the "Gas Finder" which, true to it's name, finds the cheapest gas in a specified area. Along with their basic albeit necessary purposes, widgets simplify so many things and take the place of the internet in some cases.

If you're truly interested, I would recommend doing some more personal research about apple's ibook. There are so many features (many that I did not cover) that propel this laptop past many of it's competitors. I am truly impressed with this laptop's performance and would recommend that anybody who is uncertain about apple definitely suspend any negative judgment or advice that they may have received from other PC addicts. The fact is, Microsoft has been working on their new operating system Longhorn for quite sometime now. Apple has already come out with Tiger and has consistently offered updates every year (which Microsoft has not). Apple has made computing trendy.
The iBook G4 line has been incredibly successful, for Apple. Why? It combines a beautiful and sleek form factor, while at the same time being a machine capable of getting your tasks completed.

Improvements - What were the improvements in the July 2005 update to iBook?

Faster Processor - The G4 chip was increased in the 14-inch model, from 1.33 GHZ to 1.42GHZ. Big improvement? No, but it is good to always improve performance.  The system bus speed in the 14-inch iBook was also increased, from 133MHZ to 142MHZ.

More memory - The memory in the iBook has been doubled, with a now standard 512 MB DDR SDRAM, which speeds up your entire experience on the iBook, particularly, when multi-tasking. The iBook also has an open user-accessible slot, where you can add 256 MB, 512 MB, or an entire gigabyte of DDR SDRAM. However, the now standard 512 MB, allows the majority of users to fully appreciate the iBook out of the box.

Store More Stuff - The hard drive has been increased to 60 GB, from the 40 GB that was previously standard on the 14-inch. This is important, for people are constantly putting more music, photos, and applications on their systems. This hard drive will hold thousands of songs and photos, but video takes up space fast, so be careful with that.

Even More Wireless - Airport Extreme, for wireless networking, continues to be standard, but Apple has also made bluetooth technology standard, with this iBook. Bluetooth allows you to use wireless bluetooth mice, keyboards, mobile phones, etc. It is a great technology and helps to clean-up your desktop by doing away with some of the cords.

Core Image Compatible - The new IBook G4's video card is an ATI Mobility Radeon 9550, which is core-image compatible. This allows you to take advantage of Mac OS X Tiger's core-image technology, including the well-known "droplet" effect, when you open a widget.

The great iBook features that continue to shine: A buyer of the iBook will continue to enjoy Mac OS X Tiger, which is the best consumer operating system in the world. It works seamlessly with the hardware to provide a simple, fast, elegant, and reliable experience. One of the favorite descriptions of Mac fans, to describe Macs, is simply, "it just works."

The iBook continues to include iLife '05, with great applications such as iPhoto, iMovie HD, iDVD, iTunes, and Garageband. These are all included, with every iBook G4. You will be challenged to find any PC notebook that includes applications that come anywhere close to the iLife suite. Manage thousands of your digital images in iPhoto, create home movies in iMovie, and create professional music in Garageband.

Appleworks is included for simply word processing, spreadsheets, etc., but you might want to pick up Microsoft Office for Mac. A student/teacher edition is available, for just over $100.

Superdrive - The Apple SuperDrive allows you to burn music and data CDs, plus you can burn your own DVDs!  Edit home videos in iMovie, put together a beautiful DVD menu to access those home movies in iDVD, and then burn it all to DVD!  Furthermore, you can use your Superdrive to back-up important data to DVD.

Form Factor - The iBook's strong, white casing is rugged. It is, unfortunately, prone to scratching, so be careful. However, the iBook is strong, and there are many stories of it taking a beating, but kept on performing.

Drawbacks? The 14-inch iBook G4 has a drawback when it comes to video output options. The 14-inch iBook only supports mirroring to an external display, and you cannot close the iBook, while connected to an external display, or it goes to sleep. Furthermore, the iBook splits the video memory between an external display and its on built-in LCD, no matter what you do. The external display is also limited to 1024x768, since it mirrors the iBook's own display. What does this mean? If you want a notebook that works beautifully with a big external display, when you're back at your desk, then you probably do not want an iBook. However, if you're going to use the iBook as its intended, as a notebook computer, it is a fantastic choice.

Furthermore, the 14.1" display runs at a resolution of only 1024x768.  This is not a particularly high resolution.  In fact, it is the same resolution as the 12-inch iBook.  This means you will not fit anything more onto 14-inch iBook display than you would the 12-inch display.  The 14-inch display simply makes things look bigger, which is an advantage, if you have a difficult time seeing things up-close.

Overall, the July 2005 update to the iBook G4 has made Apple's consumer notebook even more competitive in the market. It is faster, has more memory, a bigger hard drive, and bluetooth technology built-in. Furthermore, you'll continue to enjoy Mac OS X Tiger, iLife '05, and the other great Macintosh applications.  The 14-inch iBook does not offer any more screen real estate than the 12-inch model, but things will appear larger, for those with poor eyesight.  Of course, a larger size and slight increase in weight are consequences of the larger screen, but you are also rewarded with a standard superdrive for burning DVDs, which is not even an option on the 12-inch iBook.  The new iBook G4 is a brilliant machine, and it is sure to find its way onto many desks in the coming months.
Wow! This laptop is absolutely amazing and gorgeous to look at.. I bought this laptop as a spare computer and to teach myself OS X. After using it for less than 15 minutes, I had already set everything up including AOL Instant Messenger,Internet Explorer, iTunes, iDVD and Microsoft Word. I bought the laptop with 1 gb of ram and a 100 gb drive which I would highly recommend! It moves at break neck speeds and still sips battery life!

Operating System Impressions:

The entire OS X interface can be intimidating at first but once you bring out the explorer from within, it's a blast to use. FOR BUSINESS USERS, I would recommend some caution when picking up an OS X laptop. The latest version of Internet Explorer is 5.2 on Mac and some of my online interfaces for work will not work on 5.2 so I still need Windows for that and some other bits of real estate software. Software (as expected) is a bit difficult to find but I'm learning that although there are fewer software programs per category with OS X, the software programs are of much higher quality than what you will find in a Windows setting.  Apple's internet browser, "Safari", is one of the best browsers I've ever used but I decided to use Mozilla Firefox (...) as my main browser because it has a very easy to use interface and tabbed browsing. Also, the animated interface of OS X is exceptional and makes using the computer blissful.

Software/Misc. Additions:

I ordered .Mac software and the AppleCare plan with the iBook and couldn't be happier. I had an issue with FedEx shipping the iBook  and it took 4 days instead of 2 days so I called Apple's sales support team and they offered to refund the shipping without any haggling! Such great customer service gives me a great deal of confidence in the company with the AppleCare plan. Regarding .Mac, I have not been disappointed yet. Outside of the most talked about features, they have online tutorials and the homepage creation process is very simple. Once I explore .Mac further, I will try to update this review.

Hardware/Quality of Product

This is probably what I have been most impressed by thus far. The speakers on this iBook are, to understate, AMAZING! They have no bass because they are laptop speakers but the clarity is wonderful.

The one button mouse was the biggest turn off to me because I thought it would make computing such a task but it's actually comfortable and makes using the laptop easier because I'm not accidentally hitting the right click button. For desktop versions where you may be doing more intensive work, I might recommend someone looking into a Logitech MX1000 (also another wonder product) but for a laptop, one button is as much as you'll ever need.

The build quality of this laptop is legendary and Apple didn't disappoint with my iBook. It is a lot more solid and creak free than my last Dell laptop.

The screen is bright and easy to read... The best part of all.. NO DEAD PIXELS! Another sign of quality from Apple.

Lastly, the keyboard is simple, spaced out well and easy to use. The keys still suffer from "laptop syndrome" because they are all shifted over to the right by one but after a few minutes, I was able to pick it up in no time.

Final Thoughts:

The iBook or any Apple computer for that matter is a MUST HAVE for just about anyone... This is how I always thought computing should be and it's nice to see Apple is making way for the future with the positively perfect OS X. For business users, I would still keep a Windows computer around for the rare instance you may need to use it but you can keep it in the closet to collect dust (It'll be our little secret). *** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! ***

--------- Updated Below : 12/8/2005 ------------------

After spending many months with this product, I still couldn't be any happier! Make sure you get the AppleCare plan though because when you are new to OS X and Apple, there are a lot of things you won't know and they are always there to help! I promised to update the review regarding .Mac and whether it is worth the price.

Since the original writing of the review, .Mac now offers 1 gb of storage as opposed to the 250mb that I started with. I would recommend .Mac 200% because it is the best suite of tools I've ever used! Shortly after getting the computer, I had to endure the hassle of switching ISPs and my emails from the old ISP to a new email address. With .Mac, I can pay a low yearly fee and keep my email account wherever I choose to go! Also, the homepage features are stunning and the way it is integrated into Apple's suite of iLife software (iPhoto in particular) is nothing short of a programming miracle shaped by the creative people of Apple. iDisk is also useful because it allows you to create pages where others can download files from your iDisk, serves as a safe backup for items on your computer and it makes great general storage space! I haven't used the other features so I won't rate them. Highly recommended that you pick up .Mac when buying an iBook!

Long term use of the iBook makes me understand WHY everyone loves Apple computers so much! I've had so many obnoxious people that poke the LCD screen for whatever reason and still no dead pixels or any damage! To keep the screen and laptop clean, you REALLY need to pick up some iKlear. It's a product that should be married to all Apple computers! The one downside to the screen is that it DOES get pretty washed out in direct sunlight so if you plan to sit on campus in the grass or elsewhere with direct sunlight, make sure you do it within the return policy allowed by Apple (providing you opted not to customize your laptop) to avoid disappointment. It is still usable outside but I do wish the screen was a lot brighter [and yes, it is at maximum brightness! ;)].

The battery life on this thing just goes and goes and goes like I've never seen on an electronic device in my life! I can be at a company meeting and while my manager is trying to find an outlet to plug his juggernaut Toshiba into, my computer happily motors on with 3+ hours of battery life to go!

Lastly, it's been said before and I'll say it again! With OS X, everything just WORKS! lol.. it's so hard to believe that something just works without problems and long talks to the technical support team but this thing does it. When I am in a cafe or wireless network zone, all I do is open the computer and wake it up. Within a minute, it will detect any wireless networks and ask if you would like to connect to it. Imagine my delight when my manager can't get online and keeps fussing with his notebook for 15+ minutes while I just open up and have internet access!

The one thing I didn't know would happen before buying an iBook is how much I would actually love to use it... Now that I use it 99% of the time (that poor Windows machine must get lonely), I have managed to hit the speed limitations of this computer. It's not a bad thing but if you are anything like me and plan to use this for A LOT of stuff, make sure you save up and opt for the Powerbook instead. All in all, Apple has a runaway hit on their hands yet again! Buy it and you won't regret it!
Long live Mac!  It easy to use; the software is pragmatic and fun; I hook it up to my printer and e-Mac without any problems.  I'm now using a wireless router for e-mail and internet and it's great.  I'm already preparing presentations for school in the fall.

My only complaint is that some of the software that was  bundled for a free-trial offer has already expired.

I've used both Mac and PC and all I've got to say is, Why would anyone want a PC when they couldf have a Mac?
The apple ibook is the best computer that i've ever had.. not only is it beautiful but its very efficient and  easy to use.  I have not had any problems with it in the 2 months that ive owned it,  unlike other computers I have.  I have an hp desktop that I purchased last year and  ive already had to get a new monitor and the tower turns off on its own.  Hp gave me the run around about fixing it, even though I was still in warranty.  After countless hours on the phone with a foreign country I gave up and purchased this ibook.  The programs that are preinstalled are wonderful  and the customer service specialist are friendly and easy to understand.  If your in the market to buy a computer i would definitely recommend that you purchase an ibook.
Finally this just came through and i am honestly amazed by this machine.  Let me discuss dirst why i went for this machine: (i have 3 XP desktops and 1 notebook from the office)

1. I just enrolled in a distance learning course and wanted an independent light machine to work on for school only

2. This was perfectly priced for my budget

3. Needed to easliy connect in my apartment's wireless network

4. I love the zoom feature in Mac (i have vision problems looking @ small fonts. in windows this is not a standard featre and u cant enlarge eveything on all applications)

4. Mac is still virus free!

i honestly don't care what they say about the viruses situation. Let the truth be told: so even if Mac viruses picked up in the last few months, it can never compare to the ongoing agony on XP machines (if anyone is counting on numbers of spy-wear, viruses, registry corrupters etc on XP. please check the stats with NSA!)

i frankly just want a PC that works and doesn't require infamous:

DLL error fixers!

buying more registry cleaning programs

buying more antivirus junk

buying more anti spy wear junk

etc

this little machine is perfect for anyone who wants to work on internet/word processing/presentations/spreadsheets  (although u might want to pickup an MS OFFICE For Mac.)
I will be attending law school in August, and I needed a laptop, something I've never researched before. When I began looking both online and in stores, this Apple iBook came back with every option I required. Let me be honest: I was a Windows elitist. If it wasn't hacked up from the bowels of Microsoft, I had no interest in it. Macs were just computers with training wheels. How wrong I was.

  I finally, after much internal debate as well as research into cross-compatibility with my desktop PC (it is fully compatible) bought this iBook. I was especially attracted to the reputation Macs have for relaibility, which is a must for me. Also, the external casing feels so much more solid than the Toshibas and Hp's I was looking at. So I took the plunge. I've used Mac products before, so OS navigation wasn't too bad of a transition. I should say that if you are concerned about learning a new OS, don't be. OS X Tiger falls over itself to be easy to use and intuitive.

  What do I mean by intuitive? Your files end up where you think they should. They are always in easy reach. The interface (or GUI) is a work of art both asthetically and functionally. Don't buy a Mac if you want to play the latest videogames. DO buy a Mac if you want a computer that will do anything a Windows will do with a minimum of fuss that makes usage actually enjoyable.

  When I first got this baby home and turned it on, it automatically detected my Linksys-G wireless router and connected to the internet. It then updated all of the programs on the hard drive, and had me enter a password (which was the same as my iTunes account, making things simpler. That was it. Seriously. It took ten minutes tops, and I was up and running. No need to worry about virus protection or third party software working on my computer. I was ready to roll! That's the simplicity that makes me recommend this machine to whoever is reading this. Do yourself a favor: poney up the extra money for a Mac; Once you're up and running, you may never look back at Windows again (except, of course, for games!)
Mostly I love my new iBook.  I have had a few connection error message problems which my ISP and Apple repair person cannot figure out.  Still happens once in awhile.  I am still learning and can't blame the machine.  It is very fast even though I have a slow dialup connection.  I tried a web accelerator and it didn't make much difference.  That's how fast it is.  Almost like DSL or cable but slow to download as expected with a dialup.  Surfing much faster which is what I wanted.  Would recommend, definitely.  Oh, also mac help hardly ever works.  Though I found out this is a known problem and Apple has neglected to fix it.  It has to be fixed manually or with Onyx.  I am learning to use Applescript to make it less of a chore.
great performance, great look and a mind blowing interface like apple technology can provide
Exellent computer;light,good layout,well designed. I would recommend the purchase a wireless mouse instead of the using the  touch pad. Up time on the batteries is quite good and the recharge time is reasonably short.

OSX is much simpler operating system to teach to a non-computer type of person when compared to Windows.  Fewer bad things happen to a novice when mistakes are made.  There are several good books in the market place that can act as reference manuals
nice, pretty, light, very fast. Being old fashioned I hope that the plastic case of the G4 has more strength then it looks.  It looks like you had better not drop, bang, or verbally insult the G4. Time will tell. I would rather worry about more weight then a fragil machine. We'll see.
I have owned various computers since 1991:

Mac 128k

Calssic II

LC 520

Mac Portable

PowerBook 160

Duo 2300c

PowerBook 5300c

iBook Tangerine

PowerBook G4 12 in

Dell desktop-my only mistake...:-(

After developing somne vision problems, I finally decided it was time to retire "Little Al," my PowerBook G4 12 inch model. The purchase of this iBook would qualify as the best purchase of a computer in my long and illustrious computer career. It spanks the Dells I have to use at school, both in terms of usability and in terms of raw power. I would recommend getting the biggest HD you can afford. Also, since memory is relatively cheap, max it out. I do the web ppage for the school where I teach, and I usually have the following apps open simultaneously: Netscape, Safari, Firefox, Interarchy, Word, Graphic Converter, and Preview.

All in all, a great purchase.

Ted
I love this laptop.  I am blown away by its speed, agility and ease of use.  As someone who now uses a computer mainly to manage email and family photos/movies, there is now better system than a Mac.  I bought mine at the Apple Store, [...]
A+ to the Apple.
My old G3 ibook died (which I had bought second hand) due to a defective motherboard. I sent the computer to Apple for repair, but supplies were on back order and would take more than a month to arrive. Apple subsequently sent me a brand new ibook G4 "14 as a replacement, free of charge. Not only was my original G3 3 years old, but I was not even the original owner. It didn't matter. Apple treated me like a valuable customer. The ibook G4 is a great computer, and it's nice to have a company backing their products up with great customer service.  Though I only used PCs before I got my original G3, I am now a lifelong Apple user.
My recent purchase of the Apple iBook Notebook with superdrive is very usier friendly.  I am not a genius when it comes to computers and the iBook was the perfect fit for me.  It was easy to setup and in my opinion an excellant value.
What can I say. I have been a mac user for years, and they just keep getting better and cheaper. This laptop is an excellent value, and you will not be dissapointed. I am writing this review on my iBook, as I use it every day for school and work. I am a graphic artist besides being a Computer Science student, and this machine has enough power to do anything I can throw at it. I upgraded to 1.5 GB of ram, and I definately recommend that. Other than that my iBook is stock.

I daily use photoshop, in design, and illustrator, as well as XCode for programming. I have composed tens of hours of digital video on this machine as well. The 60gb hard drive, with all my software installed (about 15 gigs) will still hold 3-4 hours of DV quality video (25mb/second).

AirPort (wireless) performance is awesome. The antenna is located at the top of the screen, instead of in the base of the laptop like cheaper intel based PCs. The wireless performance is even better compared to power books. I can get a signal when none of my friends pc laptops can.

If you use unix / linux, and are looking for an alternative to running windows and / or linux, you will be excited to learn that Mac OS X is based on BSD unix. With the click of a button, you get a full terminal, with all the power you are looking for. If you want to compile and run your own programs, install the include XCode tools, which comes with gcc compilers and X11 ( xwindows server ). I run and maintain tens of unix servers, as well as a unix powered supercomputer, and I use my iBook to access these machines from anywhere in the world, securely and effeciently. Try that with a windows pc. Sure, you can get windows applications to do so (and I have used them), but OS X comes with them BUILT IN, and integrated into the operating system. Want to connect to a secure FTP server (sFTP), no problem. Just type in sftp:// into the network browser, and you are connected, like that!

Highly Highly HIGHLY recommend. 10 stars!
The 14" iBook gets four stars from me.  I feel I need to say that, since the Amazon system is not working properly now -- every time I preview this review, the rating comes up as one star.  Having tried to correct the star rating at least five times to no avail, I'm just going to hit the submit button now.

I'm giving my impressions as a new iBook owner rather than waiting several months to do so because the current iBook models will most likely be discontinued this calendar year.  You can expect the successor models to use an Intel chip.

I bought an iBook (my first laptop) with full knowledge that it will not be around in its current iteration much longer.

Why?  iBooks get pretty good reviews for laptop reliability.  I'm of the school that wants the dust to settle on a newly introduced product before I buy it.  New models are generally more prone to having problems than a design which has been around long enough to have the glitches sorted out.  Also, I'd always been curious about the Apple operating system, having always used a Windows product.

So, how does OS X stack up against Windows?  Sorry, Apple zealots, I'm not going to completely trash the competition. I have been running XP Pro (64 bit version) on my desktop for around seven months now and like it.  It works pretty well -- I've had no crashes, no blue screens of death, etc. like I was used to getting with Windows 95 and 98.  It is however, still prone to the things that plague Windows:  spyware and viruses.  According to the log on my spyware software, I've run 295 scans that picked up over 2000 tracking cookies and have eliminated the Ibis toolbar twice in seven months.  I really enjoy not having to scan for spyware at all with my new notebook.

So far as the Windows vs. Apple debate goes, -- yes, Mac OS X is an extremely stable system.  It blows away Windows 98 and the home versions of XP.  XP Pro comes pretty close to matching it in terms of stability, from my experience.  So, I give the edge to Apple.  The tradeoff for buying OS X over Windows is in software availability.

As far as the iBook itself is concerned, I like it so far.  It only took a few minutes to set up and get on the Internet.  The operating system seems a bit more intuitive than Windows.  What, as a complete novice to OS X, I expect to happen is usually what does happen.  Don't be afraid to switch due to fear of not being able to operate the computer:  things fall into place nicely.

Any dislikes?  Yes, a couple of things.  First, believe all the comments you read in the reviews about the screen on the 14" model not being overly sharp.  It isn't.  Being a presbyopic middle-ager,I bought a 14" model for the larger screen size over a 12" iBook (with which it shares the same native screen resolution).  You get a bigger, but less sharp screen.  Apple does seem to be a bit behind with screen resolution on the iBook compared to competitively priced notebooks from other manufacturers.  On the upside, the fairly low contrast viewing screen is easy on the eyes.  A high contrast screen may initially seem more appealing, but eye fatigue usually sets in much sooner.  I have yet to get eye fatigue with the iBook.

The keyboard could be better.  It does not have the nice tactile feel that the Apple Powerbooks and the better Windows notebooks possess.  The feel does not bother me that much, but be aware the difference does exist.

Also, if you use memory-hungry applications at all (Photoshop or doing a lot of video editing), go ahead and max out the memory of the iBook to its 1.5 gigabyte capacity.  It will run noticeably faster than the stock version.

Anything else bad?  Nothing pops into mind.  Would I buy the iBook if I got to start all over again?  So far, yes.  So long as it holds up over time, I will not regret my decision to buy one.
The iBook just works.  The OS X software is uncrashable and so easy to use.  This computer leaves me wondering why I ever tolerated PC's.  The iBook is a must have for any student or home user.
All I can say is that this is the perfect laptop, my track record along with all the

positive reviews here must say something. I must make note of the one reviewer

who couldn't understand why his hard drive had 20GB's filled up. This goes

to show that Apple offers plenty of extras loaded on the HD and the fact

that trouble free OSX uses a little more space than Windows. Plug in almost

any camera, printer, scaner or anything and chances are your iBook will load

without adding software, all these drivers save much time and frustration

and well worth the little space on the HD. Yes, if your picky about this or that

anyone can find fault with anything but try to find a better laptop for the

money you'll be hard pressed to come close to the iBook.

PC users with an open mind will soon discover why Mac's are loved

around the world, join the Family of HAPPY iBook owners and Enjoy!
I am a senior in high school, and I have been using Apple my whole life.  I received this laptop for christmas, and i haven't put it down since.  within 5 minutes of openning the box, all of my files were off of my old computer, all of the software was updated, the computer had restarted, and my itunes library was full.  not to mention i was already online watching videos.  I got the extra 512 MB of ram, and it was well worth it.  i love being able to lay in bed and watch dvds, and sitting down for a few rounds of army ops.  the 2 finger scrolling is awesome, and the keyboard feels very durable under your fingers.

the tiger operating system is quite possibly the easiest operating system to use.  the dashboard is an awesome feature.  it allows you to download "widgets," which are mini applications that pop up when you click on the dashboard, and they show you different things, such as weather, flight times, or even the cheapest gas in your area.  all in all this is a great laptop for anyone.
First, let me begin by saying that I have been computing since I was two years old. I started on an old DOS system, but soon moved to an Apple Performa. I have used an Apple ever since. I currently own three other computers: two Apples and one PC.

The iBook comes with iLife and AppleWorks pre-installed. iLife is a suite of applications including the following: GarageBand (an application for recording music), iMovie (for editing movies), iTunes (for music), iPhoto (for photo sorting), and iDVD (for burning DVDs). AppleWorks is Apple's version of Microsoft Office, similar to iWork, Apple's newest application suite.

I received the iBook in September, amid much anticipation. When it arrived I immediately opened it. I fired it up and started the set-up process. After about five minutes I was ready to use the computer. I then plugged in my Apple AirPort Express and was configured to surf the web after another five minutes. The five minutes included setting up the AirPort to recognize my DSL modem, the computer immediately recognized the AirPort.

I then plugged in my Sony and Canon camcorders and they were instantly recognized by iMovie. I used iMovie to edit the footage I had of Formula One United States Grand Prix footage I had recorded. Within a week I had edited all my 2005 footage, some old Formula One footage on 8mm cassettes (from my pre-DV Sony camcorder) I converted, and burned them to DVDs. I also created another DVD of some more footage of other events. I have also used the iBook to convert some of my mom's old LPs to CDs.

I have used GarageBand for some music creation and it is quite easy to use. iTunes is real easy, as well. I have added many CDs to my iTunes library. (Hopefully I can get an iPod so I'll have my tunes no matter where I am.) I use iPhoto, as well. I use it in conjunction with Adobe Photoshop to edit the images when needed. QuickTime Pro (not included) is also a wonderful investment. I have converted Macintosh formatted video files to AVI files my dad can use on his PC at work.

One note, however; I would suggest upgrading to 1 GB of RAM and an 80 GB Hard Drive. I did that and I am very pleased at the performance of the iBook.

Apple's products have always been wonderful and this is no exception. Mac OS X Tiger (10.4) is very wonderful and stable. I love "Spotlight" and "Dashboard" as well as Expos.  "Spotlight" lets the user search for files, or keywords, for every file on anything that stores files connected to the iBook. "Dashboard" contains little "mini apps" that give you very important, or interesting, information. Finally, Expos shows all the open files at once, allowing you to select the one needed.

Overall the iBook is the most complete computer (besides the other Apple products) on the market. It has to be good if other companies wish to imitate Apple's lead.
This laptop is very user friendly, and has a lot of unique capabilities. The screen is thin, and wide for a fantastic crisp looking screen display; however, the price is the biggest downfall of this product. In fact I got my laptop for free!! Just paste this site in your address bar, and have fun with it!  [...]
I admit that I don't know a lot about computers, so this review will be all about my FEELINGS!

I have never owned any type of computer other than a Mac, although at school I sometimes am required to use a PC. Using the PC is always depressing and counter-intuitive to me and I am always happy when I am back on a Mac. I have owned Apple computers since 1990 or so, and I can truthfully say that I HAVE NEVER NEEDED TO GET ANY OF THEM REPAIRED OR SERVICED! Isn't that amazing! I've never had a virus. I've never had a crash. These are experiences I have read and heard about, like unicorns and UFOs, but never experienced for myself.

Sometimes, however, I need to know how to do something obscure and I can't quite figure it out. In such cases I call the Apple-Care Hotline. Now anyone who has ever called, say, the Microsoft Hotline knows how awful calling a computer-related support number can be...you're on hold forever right? And then you end up saying your name 20 times to someone in Bangladesh who doesn't really know the product, right? Well, if this sounds like something you would like to avoid with a computer product, get a Mac. I have never been on hold more than 5 minutes and then I get a friendly, knowledgeable and often funny person who is located in the US! I know! Impossible right?!? But it's true!!! It is a real joy!

And I very much love Tiger OSX and on this computer in particular. It is so fast and you can have 20 programs open with no problems at all! You can burn DVDs and CDs on it with such ease. I have never had to read a manual to use a Mac. Most of the time I think "How would I design the computer to work if it were up to me?" And guess what? It works the way you would think it would.

Also, I don't know if this is the case for all computers now, but I love the search feature where I can type in the most obscure word or term from an undergraduate paper I wrote 5 years ago, like "teleological suspension of the ethical" and it will show me every single thing on my computer what has that sentence *anywhere* in it. In a 20 page paper I didn't even remember writing! That's amazing.

I am very much an Apple advocate. It is the one product I can think of that I will actually tout the merits of, and defend against lame PC advocates in public. I just think the Mac is one of the last well-made products in this sorry, war-ridden and weary world of ours.
-------Six Months Later------

I have upgraded to 1 GB ram.  Still works flawless.  I have maybe had to restart it 2 or 3 times in 6 months.  I cannot wait to upgrade my home computer to a new mac.

-------old review----------
Like other reviewers, this is my first Mac.  I got turned on to the Mac brand with the 20GB Ipod I bought 6 months ago.  Within a month of buying my Ipod, I knew my next computer would be a Mac.

I was amazed at the simplicity of the intial boot process.  I was impressed with the ease of conectivity to my wireless network, and to the pc's on my network.  This machine has not consumed my time like new windows boxes do.  I struggled with "hot-keys" on my pc's, here they are a cinch and a joy to use.  I also bought the MS office for this, and I love it!  The Quicken that came with this machine is not some cheap 3 month "demo", but a full on version.  The super-drive rules, making CD burns simple.  The 512 MB is enough for me, although I likely will add more.  Many of my friends are mac fans, and I have made fun of them for years.  I have eaten my words.
This is definitely one of the best notebook computers on the market.  I really like the long battery life and how quickly it goes in and out of sleep mode.  It's very fast and intuitive, and best of all it comes with just about all of the software that you'd ever need so you don't need to buy any.  (I did purchase M$ office 2004 for mac and it is perfectly compatible with the PC version.  I'm a student so I need office.)  All and all I think that Apple is where it's at as far as notebook computers are concerned because it's so well designed.  On the Apple notebooks the ports are all on the side, no need to climb around the screen to plug stuff in, also the ventilation is in the back as opposed to on the bottom, no more dust in your CPU fan and no need to worry about a blocked vent when it sits in your lap.  Wonderful product!!
I am really, really happy with my iBook, after years using PCs.

I just finished a major project for work, a 7 minute video.  iMovie, iDVD, iTunes and Garageband all contributed to the project.  After doing the same thing last year on a PC, I was surprised at how easy--and fun!--it was on the iBook.  David Pogue's book iMovie HD was an invaluable helper in the project.

After using a Dell laptop for years, I am impressed by the way the iBook instantly is ready to use on opening the display, and how the iBook usually runs silently.  Too, the battery life is very pleasing.

The integration of the iLife applications, the elegance of OS X, the attention to beauty in the interface, screen savers and design of the iBook, all make it a delight to use.

When I plugged it into an external projector, it simply worked instantly, unlike the difficulties I've had with Dells and Toshibas.  I'm really impressed, and wish I had switched years ago.

I added half a gig of RAM for about $50, which improved performance considerably.  However, the iBook was quite functional with the 512 megs it comes with.

Wireless networking is really easy--our various worksites have wifi, and I just open the iBook and it logs on, easy as pie.  Battery life is such that I can do a full day of work on the battery, if need be (not 8 hours of battery life, but probably 4+ hours of use, since I'm not using the computer every minute).  I bought an extra power supply for my office work station and keep one at home as well.

The only con I'll offer is that the iBook doesn't readily support Outlook, which I used to live within in the Dell days.  The closest equivalent I've found is Entourage, which is not in the same class.  One can emulate Windows XP on the iBook (in fact, my employer has provided me with a licensed copy of the software to do so), but I've found the Palm desktop and the built-in email client to suffice.
First off, this is my first Mac. I have always been skeptical

of Macs but the iBook completely changed that. My work

is based on computers, and I have never experienced a better

system.

(+)

-Always dependable, never fails to run properly.

-Small & easy to transport.

-Interface is extremely easy, good for people new to computers.

-Display is great, pictures and videos have never looked this good.

-Widgets are really useful!! i.e. Maps, Sport scores, Weather, etc.

-iLife has great apps, iDVD, iMovie HD, etc.

-Supports: CAT5, FireWire, USB(2), Monitor-output, 56k!

(-)

-The OS takes up over 10GB of hard drive space, really

pissed me off when i discovered that.

-If you're running it with the standard 512MB of RAM, it's

probably a good idea to go up to 1GB

-fragile keys! when i went to install RAM, one of the slide-out

keys snapped off!! had to fight with Apple rep. to get fixed under

warranty :(

-gets hot pretty quickly, its a good idea to be a well-circulated

area when using.

-PC users beware, you'll discover finding some Windows apps

compatible with Macs can be quite difficult

don't be discouraged! this is a great product & if you're

looking for a laptop.. THIS IS IT!!
I hate computers, it always seems that if there is any possibility for me to do something wrong I do.  But, I am a student and had to get something mobile to work on so I picked up this lovely item and all my computer prejudices melted away.

Let others debate the Mac v. PC issues. All I have ever wanted to do is the basic computer stuff: e-mail, word processing, listen to some music, maybe load some pictures from my digital camera . . . so far this lap top has made life a breeze for this technological moron.

It arrives in an attractive box ready to go.  I literally opend up the box and was on the internet in a matter of minutes.  The small keyboard has taken some time to get used to but I cannot think of anything bad about this computer.

Additionally, once you own a Mac you are privy to the benefits of a kind of subculture . . . all kinds of people tell me that they admire my ibook's sleek design and glowing apple in the cover, or long time Mac owners volunteer info on shortcuts etc.

So in short . . . buy the ibook because it is a all around solid investment AND it'll even make you new friends.  What more can you want!?
I love my ibook so much.  Not only is it easy to use, but its really cute.  I've always been a mac user, but have had to use PCs a lot for school and can honestly say Macs make so much more sense.  Plus, my mac has never crashed on my or ate any of my papers, etc.  I have convinced some of my PC friends to switch to mac and none of them regret it.  I know the price is a little more, but the quality and constumer servies are just so much better then what you get in the PC world.  So, buy a mac and carry it around with you!
What can I say???? Best hardware and software for the price!! Sorry Microsoft but as a user since DOS, I can honestly say you are about another 20 years from matching OS X!!!! Hasn't crashed once with heavy use!! Comes with excellent software so there isn't much to buy!!!! If you don't want to deal with Windows problems or if you are sick of Windows problems, this is the machine for you!!!!!!
The itme arrived on time and the package was very well packed, no harme was done to the item.
I'm new to apple, and this is a great product. I hope to kiss Windows good bye....
Just got this speed demon last month.  It flys thru all the app's that I have thrown at it.  I purchased a 3yr all-inclusive warrenty from PC connection for $199!  Great for DVD authoring, games and the net...  Buy it you'll love it!

PS...the looks you get from anyone who sees it is worth the price of admission.
This machine had some problems with freeze-ups when it was first introduced earlier this year, but it appears that Toshiba has finally worked out most of those issues. in addition, the new 100gb 5400rpm hard drive is impressive!

Pros:

- Attractive design - thinner and more eye-pleasing than M35/M35X predecessor

- Exceptional sound from built-in speakers, though deeper bass is lacking

- Quiet keyboard with easy-to-depress keys, though see issues below

- TruBrite display produced excellent images

- Touchpad is smooth and has good tactile feel

- Sonoma platform with 533MHz FSB

- Solid WiFi performance

- Wide array of connectivity options: 3 USB 2.0 ports, FireWire, SD/MMC/xD/MS/MS Pro Media Card slot

- Very quiet and cool to the touch - fan came on rarely and made a pleasant sound when running

- Toshiba power management and system management software: Touch and Launch, Acoustic Silencer, graphical WiFi utility

- S-Video (TV Out) for connection to projectors and TVs

Cons:

- TruBrite display exhibits lots of glare, though this is common on nearly all glossy LCD's

- Lacks DVI output and Express Card

- Display exhibits too much flex and seems fragile

- Poor 3D performance due to integrated graphics and shared memory

- Below Average Battery life

- Slower 333MHz DDR memory rather than newer 533MHz DDR2 memory, though lower latency (CL 2.5) generally compensates for slower speed

- Keyboard seems slightly cramped and is shifted to the right rather than centered; dedicated Windows key is inconveniently located in upper-right area of keyboard

- Relatively low-resolution 1280 x 800 display (98 PPI), though TruBrite has good color & contrast
This laptop is very user friendly, and has a lot of unique capabilities. The screen is thin, and wide for a fantastic crisp looking screen display; however, the price is the biggest downfall of this product. (...)
I would not recommend to buy this laptop. Here are the problems I got right after I bought my Toshiba Satellite M45-S355:

1. Built-in network card freezes for 10-15 seconds every 5 seconds. Very difficult to download big files or listen to on-line radio. Techsupport recommended downloading and installing different network card driver. Did not help.

2. CD/DVD drive does not read burned on HP Laptop TDK and some other brands disks. Any other old and new computers I tried could read those disks without any problems. Techsupport recommended using only SONY blank media. This is a bad advice.

3. Sometimes, after staying idle for more than 30 minutes my laptop won't shut down normally. The only way to shut it down is just to unplug it.
im a student and i think this is a fantastic machine, easily the best you can get for the money. the screen is amazing, theres ample disk space and the ram is amazing. i don't think ou will find a 100GB 1024MB combo for any cheaper than this and most pricier models don't even come with those specs. on the downside, the speakers are terrible and i suggest you buy some external ones. i would also suggest getting a USB mouse because the touchpad one isn't too great. the graphics are ok but nothing special... overall its an excellent buy.
I wrote the review below a month after I bought this laptop. But i am back here after 7 months to edit it.

The blue screen is GONE! It doesn't appear anymore. I contacted the Toshiba guys but they said I would have to take it to the nearest dealer. I never bothered but fortunately it doesn't show up anymore.

One thing that I want to add now is the keys being cheap. THe keypad is not very nice and few days ago, one of the keys got stuck to the pad and I tried taking it out. Guess what, the key jumped out ! So now I am living without the 'control' key because the WARRANTY DOESN'T ALLOW FOR COSMETIC CHANGES.

MY REVIEW A MONTH AFTER I BOUGHT IT ----

I bought Toshiba Satellite M45 more than a month ago from amazon. Its a beauty. Everyone's who's seen it says it looks great with wide screen and fantastic wireless card.

But there's one glitch. Its looks like an MS-DOS blue screen which comes on from nowhere. It asks me to uninstall any new software that I might have installed or contact the manufacturer. Its scary ! I did contact amazon guys (coz I bought it from them) and they said that I should reinstall the softwares. I did that and it helped for like a week but the 'blues' are back again.
I generally reboot the notebook but obviously it doesn't eliminate the problem.

I suggested a friend of mine to buy the same laptop before I ever saw the blue screen but she's is also experiencing the same problem.

Now when I look at the reviews this machine has got, nobody has mentioned this problem so perhaps its with few machines only. So in case you decide to buy it, inform Toshiba / Amazon immediately when you face this problem for the first time.

Rest of it absolutely fabulous. Great buy that way.
ladies and gentleman...this system will take ur world by storm...

nuthing in the market comes anywhere close to what this system offers...100 gb hard drive, double layer dvd burner, surround speakers, 15 inch screen, 1 gb ram  - this beauty is out of this world!!

i use it for university...and its absolutely great...it comes with onenote, which is great to take notes with...and the computer is super fast...for those concerned with battery life - rest assured, ive used this baby for 4 hours flat on batteries and thats well above industry standards!!

the wireless connects with ease...

i haven't tried the memory card readers but it seems pretty good....downside is that it dusnt support sony memory stick/pro/duo or even compact flash...but thats  not a big issue to me cuz i can connect my cam via usb anyway

all this for such a low price is awesome...this is the talk of my school...not one other person has beat my purchase interms of value for the buck....the features and the price have virtually no correlation whatsoever...take this baby home while it lasts!!!

also, my pc dint get heated up or anything...so its not an issue...also, regarding the screen glare, its a trubrite screen, so the glare is normal...but otherwise the resolution on this screen is comparable with sony's vaio and the qosmio and apple screens...its beautiful...the black border around the screen makes images bright and crisp

trust me...this is one purchase u will NOT regret!!
Hello all,
This is an O.K. notebook. Nothing special for the price. I made a couple of mistakes I would like to share with you.
I purchased this notebook through ToshibaDirect along with a NetGear router(Please see my review on the NetGear 54mbps VRG router). First of all, if you are going to buy this notebook or any other notebook PLEASE do not bother visiting any other website but make the purchase through Amazon. Amazon backs up what they sell. Trust me...if its a few dollars more it is money well spent. Secondly, after my experience with both Toshiba and NetGear customer service I would strongly urge you to look to different manufacturers for a notebook, router, or computer. I(...)
The best among other computers at the same price.

I've seen nobody having minuscule problems with Toshiba
Every notebook must be compared with "overpriced" VAIO, why? The answer is simple: VAIO is indeed the best (Apple's products not included, since it is a different world).

I was checking this Notebook that a friend bought few days ago; nothing really impressive: the battery life is less than average, the touch and feel of the keyboard is "Korean cars quality", solidness does not appear anywhere, the case is plastic, soft and lack serious resistance; the hard is noisy (with less than 10 days of interruptive work??); and my HP omnibook xe4400 (3 years old) has the same brightness and sound quality. The Toshiba too many software are complicated and absolutely useless.

This notebook is probably selling well because of the numbers: 100GB, 1MB, Intel 750..etc; but you please take a look on Sony VAIO VGN-FS630, which is cheaper and need RAM upgrade, take it in your hands, start it up .. and you will know why VAIO is the reference.
I just needed a notebook for wireless web, pics, and tunes, and this Toshiba has more than I need!  The Sony looks better, but you pay for the name and less RAM and slower processor.  The powerbook is an overpriced mac monopoly with less RAM, nuff said.  The only things lacking are bluetooth (get adapter $50) and a graphics chip (that's what PS3 is for baby).  Some complain about battery life, but I use it as a desktop replacement, so that doesn't really concern me.  Toshiba repesentin' to tha fullest son, act like you know.
I always do a lot of research when I buy a new computer.  Toshiba (and Apple) got the best rating for quality with the least amount of major repair problems.  Beyond that though, I have owned a number of Toshiba notebooks and have had almost no problems.  I considered Sony, but for the same power, I would have had to pay much more.  Beside, why would I want to pay for something with less of a quality rating?

As for this notebook. This is simply one of the most powerful notebooks for the money.  The resolution is great, fast and quiet Centrino processor, the 1 Gig of RAM makes a significant difference, the video driver is powerful, the hard drive is maybe too big, the Super DVD drive is a great bonus too.

If you are look for the best bang for the buck, buy this machine.
I purchased this laptop in August 2005 with the understanding that it came loaded with Windows XP home edition.

I found out that the software loaded was a trial version (good for 60 days)and when I attempted to enter the software's "permanent" keycode, I got an "invalid keycode" message.

According to Toshiba's tech support, I have to purchase the software at an additional cost of $200.00.

I could have saved some money and aggravation by buying a different brand.  I would not recommend the Toshiba.
I have three weeks with this computer. Up to now it has been reliable, fast and do not become hot on duty  which is very important to me. The only thing I do not like so much  is the screen size and shape, It is not square, it is kind of retangular, maybe because I am used to squared screen monitors that I find it weird.
Es la tercera toshiba que adquiero y nunca e tenido ningun problema con estas, las computadoras son ligeras y potentes y sobre todo para uno como estudiante son muy economicas.
I had my Satellite two years before it died completely, but it had problems from the beginning. It would overheat and randomly shut off. I brought it to Best Buy, where I had bought it, and they said they couldn't do anything. I later found out through an online forum (I don't remember the website, sorry), that some Satellites have had manufacturer's defects, causing them to overheat. I read reviews from many, many people who had the same problems! But Toshiba hasn't done anything to correct their problem. And when you do contact their customer service, they are unhelpful and unwilling to take responsibility.
I bought this from the local Best Buy for $1099.99 with a three year service contract for $249.99. I had to wait for a few days for a new shipment, so evidently these models are selling well. It seems like a good idea to buy from a local store so if it does need service you can carry it in rather than trust it to the mail. In the two weeeks I've had it I've tried out many applications and ran all the diagnostics I could find. There have been no problems so far. DVD movies are beautiful with this display but just remember to tilt it almost to the vertical so you are looking at it at 90 degrees.

The initial version of AOL that loads is 9.0 but without the security edition features; don't worry though it will quickly upgrade itself. Likewise the Widows XP latest upgrades will install themselves automatically in short order. All in all, I am completely satisfied so far.
I bought a Satellite laptop from ToshibaDirect, and my experience was very unpleasant. The laptop started overheated within a year, and I had to send it in for repair repeatedly (3 times so far.) Every time the laptop would work for a couple weeks and then the same problem would happen again. And the third time I sent in my laptop I had to wait about 3 weeks to get it back. But the thing I'm most angry with is that every time I call customer service or tech support, they always say "I don't know" or "we can't do anything about it."
My laptop had broken down within the one-year warranty period.

I was not getting any video output. I had received authorization from Toshiba to return it. The laptop returned from Toshiba broken!

The keys were falling off. The back of the screen had pieces missing! The case was severely damaged. Toshiba claimed that this was caused by the user, and REFUSED any service to the DAMAGE THAT THEY CAUSED. There was NO VISIBLE DAMAGE when we sent it. I am a University Professor, and had no reason to lie them (I could have just gotten another one!). Despite several phone calls from people who confirmed that there was no physical damage prior to us, sending it to them, all we got was very rude handling of the complains. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND ANY TOSHIBA LAPTOP TO ANYONE.
I found this at Best Buy for $799 after a $200 instant rebate and was generally impressed.

This machine had some problems with freeze-ups when it was first introduced earlier this year, but it appears that Toshiba has finally worked out most of those issues. in addition, the new 100gb 5400rpm hard drive is impressive!

Pros:

- Attractive design - thinner and more eye-pleasing than M35/M35X predecessor

- Exceptional sound from built-in speakers, though deeper bass is lacking

- TruBrite display produced excellent images

- Touchpad is smooth and has good tactile feel

- Display exhibits too much flex and seems fragile

- Poor 3D performance due to integrated graphics and shared memory

- Keyboard on this model feels louder and cheaper than other M45's (I compared all three at Best Buy)

- Relatively low-resolution 1280 x 800 display (98 PPI), though TruBrite has good color & contrast
I own this PC and for the price it is a great deal. If you do not need much else than a computer for business mobile use, simple DVD and music playback, and networking activity, then this is the perfect computer. The battery has a better life than the Dell that I previously owned. Dell is a nice computer if you plan to keep it in your home. But for on the go, I have been most impressed with Toshiba, the wireless networking that comes installed is great. You can pretty much find a network anywhere.

Great laptop, perfect for the college or military bound person.
This was my frst time buying a laptop, so I did a lot of research. The HP L2005US has everything that you need plus the AMD Turion 64 supports you for the future. When I finally received the laptop (after 6 days of phone calls to Amazon, but that it another story), I was amazed at how easy it was to set up my wireless network on it (less than 2 minutes) and how fast this system was. I decided to start multi tasking, trying to edit a photo, run excel, and listen to music(come with Itunesalready installed). No issues !!! Touch pad was fine, view on the screen is super. Does come with a lot of trial programs that you may or may not want. Took me about 10 minutes to clean some of these off my system. Overall, left it running for 24 hours straight, no issues - I am very happy with the laptop !!!
I come across all laptops in my profession, and lately HP's are just terrible. It really does take FOREVER to boot up, literally between 3 and 4 minutes which seems to plague all HP's nowadays. All HP's that I've seen in the past 6 months do this routinely.

The touch-pad completely sucks, Battery-life is about 45 minutes to an hour FOR A NEW BATTERY (you can bet you'll be buying that extra one if you ride airplanes). And granted you only have to do it once, but initial set-up is unusually grueling.

I'll never stray from Toshiba again.
WOW, I just recently replaced my old productivity notebook with the new HP Special Edition L2005CU notebook PC, powered by AMD's new Turion 64 Mobile Technology and I have to say it Rocks!  My unit has the added benefit of 1GB of RAM and the ML-34 Turion 64 chip which just zooms. With integrated wireless 802.11g and bluetooth I can stay connected at home or on the go.  The 3 USB 2.0 ports are nice and allow me to connect all my necessary peripherals, along with the mini IEEE 1394 firewire port. As an added bonus this unit has an S-Video port so you can hook it up to your TV and view movies, picture shows and much more. The sound quality coming from the Altec Lansing speakers is very nice too. Lastly I love the DVD+RW port my unit comes with, its very fast and it allows me to store tons of data where your typical CD-RW cannot. The brightview screen is sharp and vivid and the ATI Radeon PCIe xpress 200M display adapter handles everything I throw at it from digital content creation to movies and games, this is one fast relaible system.

All in all the LIVESTRONG notebook is a home run. I've never had any issues with Compaq or HP which is why I purchased this special unit. In fact, if you ask me, no one makes a better laptop especially when its powered by AMD processors.
This is my first PC. Coming from the Mac world, the Windows environment is taking some getting used to. I'm NOT switching. Our daughter moved back home and with three people vying for the Mac someone was always miffed. I have a wireless network for the iBook I bring home from work occassionally so getting a laptop made sense. Figured it wouldn't hurt to see how the rest of the world computes so decided to go with a PC. I did a lot of research and decided HP's Special Edition offered more for the price than any other. It has not disappointed me at all. The AMD Turion processor will allow this computer to be viable longer into the future than other processors in laptops in this price range. The wide, bright display is nicer than the iBook's. Some may find the 80gb hard drive limiting, but since this isn't our primary computer (though it is in use every single night by one of us) I don't feel that's a problem. Dual layer combo drive, wireless ready, Bluetooth, multiple ports, XP Pro, great price, rebate, free bag... I'm not sure what else I could ask for (Ok, wish it could run OS X.) The ONLY thing I would have altered is the battery, I would like to have had the 12-cell lithium over the 6-cell, but that's not a big deal.

I do have to concur with those who mentioned the free, oversized Targus bag. It's almost as large as a suitcase. Nice bag, but way too big. I'll try to sell it at our garage sale this weekend and big up one that fits better.

If you are looking for laptop in this price range, I don't think you'll do better than HP's Special Edition.
Worked for about the first 15 minutes, then started having fatal errors (aka "the blue screen of death") every time I ran more than one application at the same time. Could've spent time troubleshooting, but a computer should perform better than this straight out of the box. If I had known it was really a Compaq in HP clothes I would have never bought it (you don't find this out until you turn it on and look around - I guess that explains the low price). The only bright spot is the fact that I got a full refund including the cost of shipping it back to Amazon.
I ordered this laptop about 1 month ago to use for school.  I also ordered a linksys wireless router at the same time.  I had no problems whatsoever getting the laptop or the router to work.  The laptop is very nice and just the right size for someone on the go.

I have used it for downloading pictures and movies and it works great.  I also liked the free targus bag that came with it although it was a little too big for the laptop.  I am very pleased with this product and the price.
First time notebook owner. Partner, who is an IT admin, also thinks its a nice notebook, and is now shopping for one as a result of this purchase. :)

Brightscreen and display very nice. Snappy processer, battery life around 3 hours with internet and some video downloads with 6 cell standard battery. Plays Neverwinter Nights at max graphics game settings. However if you want a notebook that can play Doom 3 you may need to look elsewhere. Very easy to carry notebook around, lightweight and study case. Heat is an irritant; the fan/cpu are on the left hand side, and it can warm up your lap quite fast. Am looking at purchasing a cooling blanket to assist both lap and laptop. :). I can see that if hearing fan noise is irritating, it could be an issue.

Will also be upgrading the ram from 2 x 256 the notebook came with-however that is enough for what I use the notebook for. ( Surfing the net, dvd's, writing, emails, some light game playing ). Considering the Amazon price rebate AND the 100 mail in rebate, a great notebook. Chose the AMD 64 for " futureproofing " also with Windows Longhorn out next year. Already have a carry case so did not get the Targus.

Our pug managed to knock the laptop off a shelf on the 1st day of ownership and there's not a mark or dent, and the notebook's carried on fine since. Lance Armstrong badging quite tasteful.

Overall, would recommend this laptop with a gentle warning about the heat if using overlong on the lap or in bed.
We were looking for a laptop that would last at least 4 years for our college-bound son.  With Microsoft coming out with its 64-bit Windows operating system next year, we wanted something with a 64-bit processor.  We got this unit from Amazon, and it has worked great to date.  Some observations: people on various laptop forums complain that the unit runs hot.  The processor is below where your left palm rests, and it does feel hot, but not to the point of being uncomfortable for me. Another complaint is that the fan runs often and loud.  We have not experienced this at all. The screen clarity is very nice, and the it has a good solid feel to it. The 80 GB hard drive runs at 5400 rpm, which gives a performance boost over 4200 rpm drives on other units. We recommend this unit.  If you need extra battery power, or if you need Microsoft Office, you should order the Compaq V2000Z (the same unit but without the Lance Armstrong logo) through a retailer (Circuit City) or directly from HP.  Then you can substitute the 12 cell battery for the 6 cell here, or you can get the unit pre-configured with MS Office for less than buying the software at retail.  Overall, this is a very nice deal, and the Lance Armstrong badging looks great.  The Targus case is a little too big for the unit, but it does protect the notebook well, and it has a lot of room for accessories.
Loving this notebook PC after receiving it 3 days ago.
Only change I would have made by custom ordering it would be a RAM upgrade, but that's easy to do aftermarket.
(...)Amazon has the best price I found.
Hooray for Lance!! and supporting the LAF!

The promo free Targus 17" Citygear L.A. bag is very nice, but way oversize for this notebook.  A much better choice would be the Targus citygear NY 15" model with still some room to spare.
But hey, free is free.  Still, would be better if it was the right size case in the offer.  Check the dimensions.
This is the best portable you can get for your money.

No doubts in speed, capacity and processing.
I live in Mxico and you can not get deals like this here, May be neither in the US. The price of laptops like this here start in about 1600 dlls. People wonder if AMD processors are as good as INTEL and after some reserch in internet I found out that are better or worst depending on applications your run, but are almost about the same. Remember that INTEL expends huge amounts in Media and publicity and you pay for that of course. Prevoiusly I owned intel IBM and Dell laptops without complains also.

I bought this about 6 months ago and could not be happier, not to mention the 50 bucks contribution to the Lance foundation and the livestrong graphics that people think are cool.

Other Pro's: Great chasis and nice screen. dvd's movies resoultion and audio it's great.

Cons: not really lighweight.

Hurry, Get one!!

Raul Lara.
to much to list this pc is awesome i love it lots of power light ultra portable and you are suporting lance and people with cancer what more can you ask for i use my laptop as a desktop replacement and it peforms great looks great i recomend this pc to all its one awesome machine
I did so much research before buying this laptop this past summer, by the time I got it, I was convinced I would hate it. But, you know, people exagerate. Especially about the heat and fan issues. It's really not that bad. In fact, I'm often sitting in my classroom, freezing, wishing the thing gave off more heat. But even if the room is really warm, it doesn't get annoyingly hot.

The only problems I've had so far seem to not necessarily be the laptop's fault. Mostly a strange disk reading issue I've discovered recently where it has no problems reading/writing anything except for my Sims2 University (has no problem with just the Sims2) and my Back to the Future soundtack. Still haven't figured that one out yet.

Oh and the sound, it's pretty bad in my opinion, but this is the first cheap laptop I've used, so I don't have much to compare it to. It could be much worse though. Seems only loud, higher pitched sounds are tinny.

Other than that, I love it. I take it everywhere with me and I'm a little nothing of a person. If it's not heavy for me, it won't be for you.
I've been a big fan of HP for years, so I hope you understand how disappointed I was when I bought my first L2000...

What wasn't to like?  2GHz processor, 2MB of RAM, 100GB HDD, and a LightScribe drive-- I placed my order (from hpshopping.com) and eagerly awaited my new laptop.

When it arrived, I spent 4 hours installing the software I need and configuring accounts, etc.  At just under 5 hours of ownership, it went into an infinite boot loop.  Even booting from the recovery CD, reformatting, and reinstalling everything didn't work.

After spending at least 3 hours on the phone to their call center in India, they acknowledged that I might have a problem and said that they would send me a new HDD overnight.

Two weeks later the HDD arrived. Unformatted. I again used the recovery CD to reformat and reinstall the system.  This time around, the computer crashed less that one hour into setup!

I returned the unit and was talked into buying a second one, thus resetting the free return "shot clock."  Two weeks later, my second L2000 arrived and all seemed well until THEY VERY LAST DAY of the 30 day return period, when the motherboard died-- the BIOS wouldn't even load!

Needless to say, I returned it posthaste and have not purchased a third unit, despite their offer of $75 off of any other laptop.

BTW, HP has shortened their return period from 30 days to 21.  I strongly recommend that if you buy one, load a program that will keep the processor and disk busy (calculating Pi to a million digits is a viable suggestion), and "burn it in" for at least a week to make sure it doesn't suffer from what HP described as "infant mortality."
This is the first time that I have an AMD processor, and the overall performance is great.  All applications run smoothly.

Also, for the price that I paid, I got:

80GB disk space

DVD burner

Bluetooth connection

Multi card reader

If I wanted all of the above in other equipment, it would cost almost 50% more!

It was a great deal.
This is my first notebook computer - and I picked a WINNER!!! Very light to carry and loaded with features to make on the go computing easy. Built-in wireless is extremely convenient and easy to use. 3 USB ports, 1 S-Video port, pci card slot, mult-format card reader, 80 GB hard drive, dual layer DVD+/-RW drive, great sound and the BrightView screen all serve to make this notebook all I need for my small business and play on the go.

No complaints at all.

I've read other reviews which mentioned that the notebook ran hot. I have not noticed that myself. I'm usually on for up to 2 hours at a time and never did notice it get very hot. I did purchase a Targus Chill Pad and Mini Optical Retractable Mouse, but have not had to use the Chill Pad yet. Overall - I'm very pleased with the versatility and power this notebook provides.

I'm also a Huge Armstrong fan, and appreciate HP and AMD for the contribution to the Lance Armstrong Foundation.
I love this laptop. It is lightweight, portable, and high powered. It isn't the lightest, most portable, or most powerful; but gets the job done in quick and stylish fashion. The display is awsome, the DVD+_RW is outstanding, the 64 bit mobile processor works very well, the combination of Wi-Fi, bluetooth, USB 2, and firewire is incredible in such a small package. The battery life has been wonderful. I am a professional IT person. I do "heavy lifting" with computers. I am not a gammer, and wouldn't recommend this laptop for that purpose (not that it would do poorly mind you... I'd just get something with a larger screen and dedicated RAM based video card), but for just about everything else it is wonderful. I have mine dual booting with XP Pro (shipped) and Linux Fedora. Drivers all seem to be working well for Linux which isn't the case for every laptop. If there is anything I would like to be different, it would be that the screen be SWXGA instead of just WXGA, but we can't have everything can we. This is a great buy!
This is my first experience with a laptop and so far I am very pleased. I have had this until for almost a year and I still love it.

It has been reliable and has more memory than I even need for what I am using it for.

I love the 14" screen - it seems much bigger than it is.

It is compact and light - easy to carry with you.

It is loaded with all the software you need to get started.

Excellent machine.
I have this Notebook 2 weeks ago, I tested all features from it, WiFi works fine, bluetooth connectivity to cel phone works fine, I like the widescreen n' don't forget the multiple cards reader it works pretty good

I have purchased in 1099$ is  very fine to me this price, I hope that this offers come back again, some partners of mine need this item.

Pros:

Price 1099$ (two weeks ago)

Multiple card reader

DVD Burner

LCD widescreen

Firewire port

Wireless tech

cons:

dont have IR

Battery duration

I cant play Doom 3 with a good fps frame rate ;)
With less than a month with this product, I already have problems. Don't get it. Hp didn't even send an Operating System disc. I got problems with this product.....
I highly recommend this machine. I primarily use it for programming industrial equipment and it handles their unique software easily without locking-up. The screen is bright, the various ports available on all sides is handy and the battery life is OK.
The HP Lance Armstrong Special Edition Notebook is a lot of computer for the price. It has every feature and capacity that I wanted, including an onboard Bluetooth modem.  It has WiFi too.  The HP L2005US is a good looking laptop and is light in weight.  The wide rectangle shape and BriteView Screen gives the computer a modern appearance.  The AMD Turion 64 processor seemed as functional as any Intel product.  The hard drive was large by laptop standards and there was plenty of RAM.  The machine has more ports and slots than I have ever seen on a mid-range laptop-including a 6-in-1 digital Media Reader for memory cards.  The Lance Armstrong Special Edition has Windows XP Professional Edition system installed.  All of these pluses influenced my decision, but the main thing I wanted to find in a new laptop was a top of the line CD/DVD drive that both read and would burn DVDs-- more about this later.

Although this Lance Armstrong laptop is sold as a Hewlett Packard machine it is probably a Compaq in disguise.  I have no idea how much of this machine is simply Compaq equipment and systems with HP badges on the surface, but I ran into a number of indications (help feature, startup logo, and etc.) that made me suspicious.

The battery in the laptop is a six cell unit, but a twelve cell is available.  The HyperTransport feature found in the AMD technology is supposed to enable longer battery life and to reduce heat generation.  I am not sure what the battery life and heat generation would be without that HyperTransport thing, but this computer heats up a lot and the battery life seemed about average to me.

The bundled software includes the usual junk and promotional versions of programs like Microsoft Office 2003 Student and Teacher Edition trial version and Adobe PhotoShop Album and Microsoft Muvee AutoProducer, but there is some good stuff in there too.  The laptop includes WinDVD Player, Microsoft Money and Windows Media Player 10.  The Sonic RecordNow CD RW program that Hewlett Packard seems to load in its laptops has never been one of my favorites.

The Lance Armstrong Special Edition is packaged with a number of items related to the Lance Armstrong (cancer) Foundation and Armstrong's bicycling fame.  The price of the computer includes a fifty dollar donation to the foundation and is Income Tax deductible.  There are yellow earbud headphones, a yellow Lance Armstrong Foundation rubber bracelet and a little black bag packed in the box.  The laptop itself has a big LiveStrong logo on the lid and the keyboard has a Lance Armstrong autograph (simulation) in the lower right hand corner.  I should say in all honesty, none of this influenced my final decision to buy the computer.  I bought the HPL2005US because it had the features I wanted and the price was right.

Now for the bad news:  I spent three days configuring my new laptop and loading some software I wanted to use.  The installations went OK, but I thought some of the set up was sort of twitchy.  Finally, I was ready to try out the DVD+RW drive to burn a practice DVD.  Much to my disappointment the drive was apparently defective.  The drive would never read/right or even recognize a DVD disc.  It wouldn't even play a "store bought" DVD movie.  I tried everything including three different disc brands and formats.  After two days of this I concluded the Lance Armstrong Special Edition laptop had arrived with a broken CD/DVD drive.

I decided to send the machine back to amazon.com and hoped to get a refund.  This turned out to be an easy and satisfactory process.  I packed up the computer as best I could.  I then followed the instructions on the Amazon.com Web site, printed out a mailing label and took the boxed up computer to a United Parcel Service drop store, as instructed, where they stuck the label on and sent it away.  There was no charge at the UPS store and I was able to track my package back to amazon.com via the UPS Web site.  After a week or so I received an e-mail from amazon.com telling me my credit card account was being credited for the full price that I had paid for the computer.  I was not out a penny.  Frankly, I was surprised that this all went so smoothly.

The return process with amazon.com was my first encounter with that service.  It went perfectly and I considered this experience one of the better parts of my involvement with the Lance Armstrong Special Edition laptop.

I would recommend the Lance Armstrong laptop computer on the assumption the faulty CD/DVD drive in the one I bought was an anomaly.  I would also recommend amazon.com without reservation.  I have been an amazon.com customer for many years and my somewhat complicated experience with this laptop computer has made me even happier with the company.
Have had L2005US for about a 6 weeks, bought for my daughters use in collage.  Came with 512MB 256+256 1.8Ghz CPU, 80GB Disk; I purchased 1GB DIMM to upgrade to 1280MB, wish HP would offer preconfigured versions with an empty memory slot!  That said, after adding full MSOFFICE systems works great.  Also using DELL 20.1' wide screen monitor 2005PFW (1680x1050).  Had some trouble getting dual monitors with this resolution configured, but all did work when Dell monitor was configured as 2nd monitor not primary.  XP (+ATI X200M) did not show 1680x1050 resolution as being available until monitor was configured as second display w/extended desktop.  Purchased through Amazon @1099 w/$100 rebate, this just about covered the 1GB memory upgrade.  Also purchsed 12 cell battery pack from CompUSA @$99.  Standand 6 cell lasted just over 2.5 hrs, with 12 cell life is over 5.5 but not quite 6 hrs. Sound quality from internal speakers is good but no substitute for good external speakers (using JBL Creature 1 - awesome for size). Except for wasting a 256MB DIMM, I (we) are very happy with purchase.
Me gusta muchoel producto , su peso es genial, lo mejor es la pantalla, la memoria es compartida con el video eso quiere decire que es de 512 - 128 eso es un defecto pero es muy rapido,

lo tengo en una red inalambrica y funciana perfecto la velocidad es buena. El peso del equipo es adecuado y se puede trabsportar facilmente. En pocas palabras es un a buena compra
Two reasons why this unit does not get five stars:

  1. It's a Compaq.  HP should have the Lance Armstrong Special Edition be it's most powerful and robust model....as Lance is...

  2. The case material shows every fingerprint that touches it and must be cleaned daily...

Otherwise this is a good little laptop and for less than $1K, a good buy...Lynn Stubblefield, Nashville, TN
I love this notbook.  I've wanted one for a while but really didn't need a second computer.  It has everthing and more, wireless is the best thing ever.  The main reason I got this though was the fact that it's a "LIVESTRONG" special edition.
Nice and light and shows good performance.

Hard Drive (80 GB) is a big above the average on the market. Good to have XP Pro also.

I don't like so much the sound, but that's not so relevant to me. The design looks fine, but the material seems fragile.

Has very good features for it's price.

The case with comes with the notebook is oversized but useful....and free.

Glad to contribute with Lance Amstrong's fundation.

I'm very satisfied.
Amazon.com has the Best Deal for HP Special Edition L2005US. Let me put this way

1. Very Good Low Price for Turion ML-30 64 bit AMD Processor which is very Fast compare to Centrino especially when you do Graphics and this is because it has fast Processor and fast graphics chip which is ATI RADEON XPRESS 200M w/productivity ports.

2. Has everything from Wifi 802.11 B/G, Bluetooth, USB, Firewire. Svideo Output, Multimedia Slots for SD/CF. Microphone/Speaker Connections, Dual Layer DVD Writer. Nice and Sharp Wide Screen. Setting up Wifi and Bluetooth was a breeze. Besides that Wifi range is good and signal strength excellent.

3. I already burned couple of CD's DVD's burns pretty fast. Also Burning S/W is very easy to work with.[Sonic Digital Media]

4. Not to mention Fast and Free Shipping

5. Bag is good but little Big in size. But you can put other stuff. like Mini Mouse or Tools or CD Case etc...

6. Battery Life according  to my test give almost 3 hr i would say around 2hr 50 min. with normal use and Brightness lowered. Screen looks preety good even at lower bightness. So battery life not the best but its good enough. You always have a choice of buying 12 Cell Extra Battery and still price would be cheapter then similar Centrino Laptop.

Compare to Other Laptop i recommend this laptop for the Price and features you get for this price. Overall Laptop have very good look. Comes with Lance Armstrong Autograph and Band, Small Bag etc.

Software CD includes Windows XP Prof with SP2 CD and Driver DVD. Plus other two CD's.

I am very satisfied with this Laptop and recommend it.
I own a PowerBook G4 Aluminum and an Athlon 64 Notebook before I purchased this HP Special Edition L2005US 14" Notebook PC. When I first saw this notebook at computer store, I immediately took notice. First, it's the AMD Turion 64 processor. Second, it is the Lance Armstrong tie-in. I have always been a fan of Lance Armstrong, and it influenced my decision to buy this notebook.

Even though this notebook has a graphic cards that shares the memory with the system, the performance of Radeon XPress 200 is adequate for the many 3D graphics. Not the best, but much better than some other integrated graphic processors.

Love the wireless connectivity (Wireless Network and Bluetooth).

Love the fact that it has DVDR/RW/CD-RW Combo Drive.

The only thing that I added after I got this notebook is RAM. Get a 1GB DDR333 (PC2700) and install it when you can spare some cash if not immediately.

There is also the Compaq counterpart of this notebook (Compaq Presario V2311US Notebook) but I'd rather get this HP Special Edition L2005US 14" Notebook PC. Buying this notebook also means donating minimum of $50 to the Lance Armstrong Foundation, a foundation that helps people living with Cancer.

I have shopped around for this particular model, and Amazon has the best price for the feature.

If you're looking for an affordable PC notebook, Get this HP Special Edition L2005US 14" Notebook PC.
I've been living with this laptop for about 5 months and am finally ready to write a review.

First off, this amazing machine is not made for portability or business (on the go) use. Its main function is a desktop replacement. It's large, heavy, hot and has crappy battery life. If you're looking for a notebook that is going to be constantly on the road with you, this is not the one.

Now that that's out of the way....here's the positives. What stands out the most is its value. I paid approx $1500.00 from Best Buy after rebates. Now 5 months later I bet you can get it even cheaper! And that $1500.00 got me the following:

17" Widescreen Xbrite Display / Full Size Keyboard

2.8ghz P4 HT

1gb PC3300 RAM

80gb Hard Drive

128mb ATI X600

16x DL +/- RW / DVD

Integrated Bluetooth, IR, and Wireless Wifi B/G

4 USB 2.0

Windows XP Media Center W/ External Tuner Box

Now, I defy anybody to find a laptop this stacked for that price. If you price up a Dell or Sony....or pretty much any brand with the same hardware, I guarantee the price will be WELL OVER 2gs. Most I have configured are over the $2000 mark WITHOUT my system specs. Too bad Cnet never seems to mention that in all its laptop comparisons.

The 17" screen looks great and have absolutely no complaints about it. The 2.8ghz HT P4 and the 1gb ram make any project a breeze. It's 128mb ATI card gets the job done when it comes to gaming also. I'm able to play games like FEAR and Battlefield 2 at 1027*768 with details set to medium. However, if you're able to find or afford the optional 256mb card, I suggest springing for it...just for that added punch.

The DVD drive also works like a dream. It rips and burns DVDs like a champ, plus I love the dual layer option...I just wish the price would come down on the media.

And it goes without saying all the wireless functions work great. I get connectivity with the B/G in a lot of places my desktop cant. The reception seems above average.

An added extra which I love that came with media edition is the external tuner box. It plugs in via a USB 2.0 port and connects up to 3 video devices using coax/S video and component, PLUS has extra inputs for FM antenna. I've tinkered around with the box and software, all of which are easy to use and reliable. I just might have to retire the Tivo soon!

In closing, if your looking for a desktop replacement or don't plan on moving the laptop out of the house often, you simply cant beat the value and hardware with this machine!
I get told by HP sales that the unit has a 12 month international warranty.

So after the laptop dies in another country I get told I will have to return it to the US (at my own cost) for any repair.

Does anyone want to buy a useless paperweight?
I have had several of these machines --- with them typically moving once a day. All of them have the middle pin of the power connector breakoff within a year. The only authorized repair is to replace the ENTIRE mother board (some $700 is out of warranty).

If you buy one, make sure you get an extended warranty for any of this line of PCs -- and be prepare to have it in repair for 2 weeks a year (and be prepared for it).
HP laptops are not sturdy. I purchased one a year ago and after very light usage to complement a desktop PC and about half a dozen road trips, the AC power connector is unreliable and the left button on the trackpad/mouse is almost unusable.

The power connector -- the port on the laptop itself, not the adapter accessory -- intermittently fails if I move the computer at all, and it gets ever harder to remove the power plug from the port. From what I read online I can expect it to eventually fail completely, rendering the computer useless.

If you search the web for "HP laptop power connector," you'll find a cottage industry devoted to fixing power connectors in these models for two-to-three hundred dollars apiece. You'll also find numerous complaints by customers who've also been disappointed by this poor workmanship and design and HP's deaf ear to complaints about same. If you expect high quality based on the HP name, rest assured that this does not apply to their laptops.
This is a really fine piece of equipment.  I have been using mine for heavy-duty document management, word processing, and yes, pressing CDs for my car and boat CD players.  This one does everything well.

The screen on this unit is bright and beautiful.  It is a pleasure to do work on, or watch DVDs.  I purchased the unit for use with certain trial management software, which is memory and graphics intensive.  The 8230 has performed flawlessly with no crashes, freezes, or other problems.  The 3.4 Ghz Pentium 4 is blazingly fast, which makes this machine a pleasure to use.

This is not a small computer.  It is a large notebook computer that is in every way as capable as a full-blown desktop.  If you are looking for a little machine, this is not the unit of choice.  If you are looking for a portable notebook computer that is very powerful and capable, and size is not a major criterion, then you cannot do better than this machine.

I particularly love the Lightscribe DVD player.  It is the solution to a longstanding problem to be able to flip the CDs over and etch a very professional label onto the front without messing with sticky paper labels.  Nice to get rid of the unprofessional magic marker labelling of disks.  Once you experience Lightscribe there is no going back!

In my opinion the main accessory most users will want with this machine is a Kensington Bluetooth Optical Mouse.  I have never liked the touchpad mice of the type that this unit comes equipped with.  I went with the Kensington Bluetooth Optical Mouse, it installed in seconds, and has worked flawlessly ever since.

The HP zd8230us is a home run.  It has become my essential tool for heavy duty trial presentations, document management, music management, and wordprocessing on the go.  A powerful and effective tool that is great fun to boot!
I have only had this for a few days, but the features are incredible!  The ability to watch and record tv, consolidate my pictures easily and having wi-fi & bluetooth has been awesome!  I have already used the pvr to record my favorite shows and the digital media slot to download my pictures from my camera.  It was so simple and easy to use, right out of the box. Having all the capabilities of my desktop and then some in a smaller package is a definite plus. Although the price is somewhat steep, it was a worthwhile purchase in my opinion.  I will never have a desktop again!
This is one of my favortie things of all time, this computer is with me all of the time and i can use it wherever i go including to get a lot of this college school work i need to get done, thanks to this seller and amazon i will be set for the rest of my college life, thanks again
I ordered my HP Pavilion 6130US refurbished (like new) for $820.00.  It came as described above except that it included Windows XP Professional instead of the Home edition.

While I am seeing laptop deals coming down in price, I remain  satisfied with my choice.  It is fast and beautiful.

The extra weight is, for me, a good trade off for the larger screen and increased functionality.

The zv6130US is not today's state of the art for sure, but it is all I need - and as much computer as I could hope for at this price.

Actually, I am astonished.  In 1982 I spent $1,000. for a 64 Kilobyte Radio Shack Model 100 laptop that used 16 kilobytes for B.A.S.I.C.  And I had to write my own software.
I'm a full time student and working professional.  Six months after plopping down the full retail value for this box, here's the pros, and here's the kinks:

Pros-

Great screen. No dull spots.  Does video and even some high end games really well.  Sometimes we just put it on top of the TV and watch videos straight off the box.

Sound system rocks.  I've completely abandoned any portable speakers. There's no need.  It will fill a room by itself.  The bass is low in these circumstances, but I mean, it works.

Keyboard and layout works well.  Sometimes you accidentally brush the touch pad, but you can turn it off with a thumb.  You don't even have to stop the keystrokes.

Processing capability turns back flips.  I do media editing on it regularly.  Handles Photoshop, Illustrator, and Dreamweaver like a pro.

The wireless assistant is probably the best stock wireless searching program ever.  This is probably on all the new XP installs, but it's worth talking about.

It looks really cool and it fits everywhere.

Side mounted everything is really convenient.  My brother got a Gateway at about the same time and is really jealous of those.

Cons:

It's a chunk.  This sucker gets heavy hauling it around all day.

The trim along the lower right corner busted off about three weeks after I got it.

It's loud.  Almost too loud to use in class.  Also, the CD drive rattles.

I've gotten several CD's stuck in mine.

The batteries are crap.  Even on max battery, I only got about 2 hours battery life.

It gets too hot.  Sometimes it even shuts down.  It straight up needs more heat sinks.

The harddrive is slow and it slows down the rest of the machine when you're hitting it hard.

It's too big to use on an airplane.

The sticky keys function annoys me sometimes.

Overall:

Ass kicking box.  Great value, great performance.  I don't see how you could be disappointed.  The core components of the system are all first rate.
I'm very pleased with the product and the price.

Thanks
This laptop is a great laptop. I recently graduated for InterActive Media Design. And it's been a great help for me. I'm using Adobe softwares and Dreamweaver softwares and the processor speed is pretty faast. Although the battery life doesnt last that long, it's still pretty good for design softwares and for movies too because of its widescreen. And its not bad for playing games too. It has a lot of hard drive. Great graphics. great laptop.
For the price, this laptop was a steal. Of course it doesn't have the features of a $2000 laptop, but it fits my needs perfectly. I mainly watch videos and listen to music with it, and these speakers and the monitor are probably the best around. I have not had a single problem or complaint about this computer and would highly recommend it to anyone who wants a powerful computer and not break the bank at the same time.
Excellent product, as evidenced by its short supply. This is the ideal desktop replacement. You get a lot of bang for your buck. I purchased three already for friends and am going to get a fourth one next week.
I've found this to be a great notebook. It's completely replaced my desktop for work and for play, except for the most intensive 3D games.

Pros:

Easily fits in my normal sized backpack.

Very nice and bright display.

Great audio quality compared to most notebooks I've tried.

Resumes quickly from standby and hibernation, even with upgraded RAM.

Touchpad can be easily disabled, handy in cases where your wrist may brush against it while typing.

Very reasonably priced.

Quiet, except for when the CDROM spins at full speed.

Cons:

Comes with two 256MB sticks. One is under the keyboard and requires significant work to get out. Documentation on the process is poor.

Pricing is hidden on Amazon, without going through hoops.
I bought this notebook when it was available locally with $250 in rebates....it was an amazingly good buy.  Great screen, very quick for office work/internet. The ATI graphics xpress 200 doesn't impress me, however....don't expect much performance for games unless you run at low resolution.  Card reader is a great feature.  I use this computer usually plugged in so I haven't really tested battery life. Very pleased with my purchase for under seven hundred bucks!
This laptop is good for teens / college students, as you can do most basic functions like taking notes in class or watching movies in the dorm. However, the battery time is minimal and it only has 256mb memory - pathetic for a laptop - very slow boot time, and only one or to activities can be run - not simultaneously...

Lack of more memory makes it not so good buy for the price, as you can get a Gateway 512mb at $379
I am a convert. Last December I made the switch from a Dell X300 PC laptop to my first Apple computer, a Powerbook G4 12". The one thing I knew I was giving up on was weight: The Powerbook 12"'s weight is acceptable but not great. This was -the- deciding factor against a larger Powerbook.

Overall, I was super-happy with it, except that I had a couple of hardware problems: Within 60 days of my purchase my hard drive died and had to be replaced. Later on, I started to have system crashes intermittently when connecting the computer to an external DVI monitor while in sleep mode and then bringing it up from sleep. (I have yet to find a web thread addressing this issue, but I do know other people with this problem.)

The one thing that kept disappointing me was the screen. Even though I have 19" flat panel displays both at home and at work, I do use the laptop standalone often, and 12" just wasn't cutting it for me. Another thing I regretted was not getting a SuperDrive, which would have allowed me to make family DVDs for example. Yet another thing was the fact that in low light conditions (e.g., in bed) I just couldn't see the keyboard. Some Thinkpads have a very cool blue light coming out of the top of the display that illuminates the keyboard but the Powerbook 12" didn't have any such thing. Finally, I felt the disk was too slow to allow efficient use of FileVault (on-the-fly encryption/decryption of your files which I find extremely important to feel good about traveling everywhere with sensitive job information).

Then a grad student of mine showed me the 15" he had just bought. As I lifted it, I was surprised that the extra 1lb was barely noticeable.

Shortly after, when Apple released the new wave of Powerbooks, I grabbed this baby. I did order a couple of upgrades: 1GB on a single DIMM (now I think two DIMMs would have worked just fine) and a 7200rpm disk to help with FileVault. I transferred all my data from the 12" (this was a breeze by the way) and have been using it ever since (disclaimer: ever since = 1 week).

All I can say is that this is an awesome machine. The display is so bright, contrasty, colorful, wide! The keyboard is comfortable (softer keys, though, which I initially resented) and is automatically backlit when ambient light is poor. (The display's brightness is adjusted as well.) The full-size DVI connector also gets rid of that ridiculous dongle I had to endure with the 12" (a VGA monitor/projector still requires an adapter). I am also surprised at the duration of the battery for such a "powerhouse," I suppose it has to do mainly with the fact that the processor is under 2GHz but I have no data to back this up. I am assuming my 7200rpm is eating up some battery time but it still is quite decent.

Overall, I highly recommend this computer.
In October 2005, Apple updated its Powerbook G4 15 & 17 inch models, for the first time, since late January 2005.  Unfortunately, a faster processor was not included in the update.  However, it was still a worthy update!

From when you first take this Powerbook out of the box, you are immediately impressed by its size, texture, sleekness, and overall clean design.  The packaging is beautiful too, with the Powerbook comfortably nestled in, with all the accessories, and a packaging cover, which reads "Designed by Apple in California."  If you've anxiously awaited the arrival of your Powerbook, you will not be disappointed, when you start to open it up! When you turn it on, you're quickly greeted my OS X, and the Powerbook experience continues...

Processor - The 15-inch Powerbook continues to be ran by a PowerPC G4 processor running at 1.67 GHZ.  This processor is more than acceptable, for the vast majority of customers.  It does a great job at daily computer tasks, and it is even very capable, for pretty intense photo work, and light video work.  It is only unfortunate that we could not have seen a small boost to the processors, however, it was evidently not something feasible in this update, so Apple made up for it, with updates to other areas!

Screen Resolution - The biggest improvement to the 15-inch Powerbook is an increase in screen resolution.  Simply, a higher resolution allows you to fit more data, onto your display, making you more productive.  The display now sports a 1440x960 resolution display allowing you to fit more windows or more of your photograph, on the screen.  A valuable asset.

Double Layer Superdrive - The Powerbook G4 now has superdrives (DVD burning capable) across the line.  However, the 15 & 17 inch Powerbooks now sport double-layer super drives, which allows you to fit up to 8.5GB of data, on a single double layer disk.  The drive's speed is still marketed as 8x.

Memory - The Powerbook continues to come standard, with 512 MB of memory, but new system architecture now makes use of DDR2 memory.  The 15 & 17 inch Powerbooks can be user upgraded, to have a maximum of 2 GB of memory.  If you're going to be using your Powerbook, for more than basic consumer tasks, you will want to add more memory.

Graphics - The 15-inch Powerbook now features 128MB of video memory standard, and the ATI Mobility Radeon 9700 card allows you to connect your 15-inch Powerbook to beautiful, big, displays such as the Apple 30-inch cinema display.

Ports - The 15 inch Powerbooks have a great array of ports.  Some of the very best in the industry.  S-Video output, DVI output (plus a VGA adapter), Firewire 800, Firewire 400, Gigabit Ethernet, 2 USB 2.0 ports, audio in, audio out, and a PC card slot.  Whatever it is, you'll probably find a way to connect it to your Powerbook G4.

Mac OS X - If you're considering Macintosh for the first time, you're going to love the Mac operating system, Mac OS X Tiger. It is incredibly user friendly, and you'll quickly find the interface and design is saving you time. Furthermore, Mac OS X is much more secure than Windows, so you can put your mind at rest.

iLife - Although many power and professional users of a Powerbook are going to be using his or her Mac, for a lot of professional work, with professional applications, Apple still includes iLife with every Mac. iLife is a great way to manage your personal digital life. Store and manage your digital images in iPhoto, jam to music in iTunes, create music in Garageband, and create simple movies in iMovie.

Furthermore, there are convenient applications built right into the operating system such as Dashboard, iCal (a great calendar that syncs up with your external devices including iPod), Dictionary, Expose, Stickies, DVD Player, and more.

Appearance - The Aluminium enclosed Powerbook G4 may very well be the most beautiful notebook computer line ever made.  It is an easy case to argue, for the sleek lines, and beautiful finish catches the eye of all who see it.  Furthermore, it comes in light at 5.6 pounds.

Battery Life - In ideal conditions, the 15-inch Powerbook G4 now sports longer battery life, with up to 5.5 hours.

Wireless - Your 15-inch Powerbook will come standard, with an Airport Extreme card, for wireless networking.  Furthermore, a bluetooth module is included, allowing you to use wireless devices, such as keyboards and mice, plus sync devices such as a mobile phone.

Value - The increased value of this updated Powerbook G4 is one of the things that make it very appealing.  Apple previously offered two 15-inch models: one, for approximately two-thousand dollars, and one for approximately three-hundred more.  The higher end had more features.  Those features have now been made standard on the 15-inch model (improved in some areas), but yet the price now starts at where the low-end used to be.  That makes this Powerbook a great value.

Overall, Apple has put great new features, in this update to the 15-inch Powerbook G4.  You'll find yourself more productive with its high-resolution display, double layer superdrive, and fantastic video output options, with its capable video card.  The Powerbook G4 15-inch is a fully-capable and feature-rich professional notebook computer.  If you choose it as your notebook computer, you will no doubt benefit from its performance, reliability, and simplicity of design.
This laptop had a dead battery on arrival and it would not charge. However, it worked from the power adaptor. Seems it was a bad battery, there was a batch of them apparently. Of course this would not have happened if I had purchased from the Apple Store or other retail place but I would have paid more and amazon.com had a $200.00 rebate for this model. Anyway the day it arrived I called Apple and after they checked the serial numbers and ok'd it, a new battery arrived the next day. Other that, it has performed above expectations. I would suggest you add more RAM as that will speed things up. This machine is a work of art.
I was a Windows home user and now I'm a very happy Mac user. I'm still getting to know the Mac OS features, but the Powerbook is working pretty well until now. The screen is excellent!!

It's very thin, light and has a very nice design.

It comes with 512Mb but I bought an additional 1Gb memory from Transcend (excellent price!).

The only problem I have until now (I've been using since Jan 14, 2006) it that after a sleep due to battery ending it seens to freeze the keyboard and trackpad and I need to turn it off and on, but this I still don't know if it's a hardware problem or a software bug.

I'd recommend it!
Bottom Line: Don't buy this iteration of the PowerBook - (...). On paper the specs are great. But, as several posters have said there are two huge problems with this PowerBook which Apple refuses to acknowledge let alone fix!

First, there are profound issues with the audio. The audio skips and stutters randomly. I know I'm not the only one experiencing this difficulty. Apple has issued a Knowledgebase document on this issue [...]  But the solution - if one can call it that - doesn't work and essentially implies this machine is seriously crippled in its ability to multitask. When I've called AppleCare they either deny the existence of the problem or have no solution.

Second, there are profound issues with the screen. Apparently, there is horizontal banding of every second or third pixel row over the entire screen. Each pixel row is darker or lighter than it's neighboring pixel rows. This is a well documented seemingly ubiquitous issue over the entire line of new 15" PowerBooks and again a problem that Apple does not acknowledge.

It appears some people have sent the computer in to AppleCare for repair for this issue and it was returned without any repair done the technicians claiming that the problem is "WITHIN SPEC" meaning that the screen is within the model specifications and that it is not a problem or they are shipped a replacement which exhibits the same problem.

If you still feel like gambling on one the good news is Amazon has a great return policy so if you have one or both of these problems Amazon will take it back.
Although I recently had trouble with my previous generation Powerbook, I contacted apple and was able to send the old laptop back and received this one a few days later.  My previous powerbook had 1.5ghz, Combo drive, the slower DDR Ram, and less screen resolution.  This Powerbook is already much quicker, even after loading all the things back on to it. I love the higher screen resolution and the added battery life.  It really does make a difference!!!  Although I do see the lines on the screen when up close to the panelb ,but I mean you have to be REAL close to see it.  Needless to say, it doesn't bother me one bit.  I had no battery problems (with either powerbook) and would recomend this computer to anyone.  My sister recieved a Toshiba for Christmas and is already on the search for an extra battery to extend her short 1 hr and 7 min life. Although I was upset about my first computer, it eventually got me a brand new upgrade at no cost and I could never be happier!
I decided to go for the laptop despite reading negative reviews. As a result I am sitting on a couch and typing this review.  Everything is good for the exception of one thing:  I have to sit close to the outlet because the battery that was shipped with this $2,000 computer was dead!  After paying a good sum for the machine, I expected to work this without problems; I guess I was wrong.

The problem with the screen is blown out of proportion.  The lines on the screen are as normal as any pixelation that one may see.  I have been doing digital photography for quite some time and after looking at my screen I did not find any problems with it.  The quality of the images is the same. Sure, if I use a 10x magnifying glass I will see some lines; that is expected.

I am not 100% sure, but I think that I am going to return this latop back to Amazon for a full refund.  If it were a cheap Dell, I would try to get a replacement part; however, for an expensive latop this is simply unacceptable.  It should work right out of the box.

Thank you.
Do not buy this laptop if you have any intention of watching DVDs, playing music, or playing any sort of presentation that has audio. All new 15" and 17" powerbooks are exhibiting an intermittent audio looping problem. Apple Support says they know nothing of the issue, yet Apple has released a Technical Support Note ([...]) that offers this solution: "To avoid this [audio problem], run only one audio application at a time".

I have the problem with iTunes, Mail, iChat, DVDPlayer, and Finder. All of these applications output audio.

A detailed thread on the problem can be found here: [...]

Additionally, I have had faulty batteries and a sticky trackpad button. The quality is just not there.

Until Apple offers a fix for the audio issue, I strongly suggest not buying this product.
Sadly, I have to add my voice to other customers who have received a defective Powerbook. Apple puts incredible thought and sophistication into design and form factors, but judging by my experience and what others have posted, something has gone wrong with their QC.

When I opened Apple's beautiful packaging, I found that the finish on the laptop's lid suffered from several small imperfections (the aluminum was pitted in one spot and in another place had an uneven, almost scratched look.

This was annoying, to say the least. But I decided I'd overlook these small flaws, as they were purely cosmetic. What I couldn't overlook was that the battery wouldn't charge! Others in this forum have noted that their new machine came with a dead battery and flawed screens. My screen was gorgeous, with no dead pixels or other flaws. But the combination of the flawed lid and dead battery was too much for a $2,000 purchase, so I'm (sadly) returning the Powerbook to Amazon.
My PowerBook G4 15 incher suffered a processor board failure after a mere two months of use. It had to be shipped out to an Apple repair facility and I have been without it for almost two weeks. No, Apple did not offer me a "loaner" while the PowerBook was in the shop.

Sure I have backed up my files and got by with my old computer but the PowerBook is marketed as a professional's computer and I find this failure inexcuseable for a $2,000+ top-of-the-line laptop.

Do not buy this product until Apple gets its quality assurance act together!
I love this computer and it is one of the best purchases I made this year. Everything about it is great- that is once I got a machine that actually worked properly. I first ordered the 12" PowerBook from Amazon and it arrived DOA- the ethernet port was defective and it would not connect to the Internet. I returned the 12" to Amazon and then decided to get the 15". This time around I received a computer that would not work on battery power. Worked great when it was plugged in, but the battery would not charge so I had to send this one back too. I guess the third time really is the  charm because when I got my 3rd PowerBook it finally worked. I've had it for several months now and it works great. I couldn't imagine life without it.
It's really disappointing and annoying this issue with horizontal lines that plagues the new Apple Powerbooks, especially the models with a 15" screen.
The new Apple Powerbook is a great, if not, an almost-perfect machine. It could be perfectly use as a desktop replacement, being powerful enough for most people to do their work and their normal everyday tasks.

The horizontal lines are barely noticeable under normal work, web browsing, emailing and word processing. When you get into graphics, picture editing or video editing, you do really see the lines, especially running across faces if you're working with pictures. This problem is a major problem for those of us who take our display seriously. If you're a professional photographer who relies on their Powerbook to work and make money, you will find that your job will be greatly obstructed and you will become frustrated with this growing problem. Heck, you don't even have to be a professional photographer or a graphics or web designer. Even the average Joe who uses their Powerbook for photo editing for his own family picture will notice these lines, supposing Mr. Joe has at least a bit of attention for detail.

I believe Apple should fix this problem as quickly as possible, and so do think many, many other unhappy new Powerbook owners. When you're paying almost $2,000 for a notebook computer, you expect a great, non-defective, quality product. You don't expect to have problems with the most important part of the notebook - the screen. The screen is what you use the most on a laptop, isn't it?

Some people claim that they do not have the lines. Please, look a little closer, look at different pictures and shades of color. I've noticed that full colors don't display the horizontal lines. I did not seem them in dark colors, like red, blue or black, but do appear on gray, light blue (Tiger's default wallpaper), and earth-like colors. Other people argue that the lines are barely noticeable - Yes, this is exactly what I thought, until I did something different than web browsing and emailing on it. Try looking at family pictures or editing some video - Then you will notice a difference if you have a flawed display.

Other than the horizontal screen problem, the Powerbook is an excellent computer. Having owned one for nearly a week and being this my first laptop, I'll say I'm mostly pleased with it. I really like the display resolution, the widescreen, the backlit keyboard. The speakers also sound pretty decent compared to other notebooks on the market. The computer feels fast enough for most of my everyday tasks, which are web browsing, emailing, light photo editing, some gaming, some video editing and listening to music. Another minor annoyance is the strength of the Airport Express card. I have compared my reception to my girlfriend's Dell, and where she gets 5 full bars, I get 4 and sometimes oscillates between 3 and 4.

The battery on my PowerBook was also dead on arrival when I received it. It wouldn't charge at all. A quick call to Apple and the customer service representative acknowledged the problem and quickly set me up to send me a replacement battery. Within 48 hours of that call, I had a new, working battery in my doorstep. I sent back my dead battery in the pre-paid box and didn't even have to step out of my house because it was picked up.

I hope the horizontal screen problem is as easy as a software update or firmware update. If it's a hardware issue, I hope Apple recognizes fault for shipping a defective display and offers a replacement display, free of charge, to affected users.

It's not a perfect computer, at least not yet, but a very nice computer compared to what's in the market now.
I received my 15" powerbook thursday evening. Plugged it in.  In the morning I opened my mac to find the battery had not charged.

Called Apple Care and opened a ticket.  went to Apple Store which was a complete waste of time.  Apparently, apple care means different things based on point of purchase.  I patiently waited 40 minutes watching the "Genius" work on 5 ipods.  All but the HP ipod was attached to a store computer for troubleshooting.  My amazon purchased laptop got zero attention.

Yes, there are horizontal lines which appear to fluctuate based on saturation and luminence, Its not acceptable.

Apple knows they have a faulty product, which is too bad since when its plugged in its a great computer.

I'm not sure what's up at Apple but they have slipped up on QC for their new 15.2" powerbooks.  I'm now packing up the second replacement for return to Amazon.  And am going to have to wait another three weeks for what I suspect is another defective 15."  The first arrived with a partially defective hard drive.  The second had a dead battery that refused to charge (Apple is sending out another).  But what instigated the return is that I cannot get the ethernet cable to detach from the computer.  (I've got a PhD in bioinformatics and have rigged my house with custom cat 5 ethernet cable so I pretty sure I'm doing the obvious).  What's up Apple?  Your operating system is awesome but your QC seems quite poor.  Any chance you'll allow us to install Tiger on a T43 Thinkpad? On a second note, I have seen the horizontal lines but for both machines it's not been a big issue.
I really wanted to like this Powerbook, but these latest models have been particularly troublesome.

The first unit I received had a completely dead battery (wouldn't hold any charge), horizontal lines running across the screen (see other reviews), and several stuck keys.

The second unit has a working battery (lasts 3:30 on a charge) and perfect keyboard, but there are STILL horizontal lines visible on the screen.

My advice is to wait until Apple fixes these problems before spending $2k on a Powerbook.
I bought this laptop after being so impressed by the new iMac that I purchased.  I'm not one for spending lots of money on computers, but these computers are worth every penny.

The last laptop I owned was a Toshiba Satellite, and the laptop I owned before that was a Sony.  I ended up having major problems with them both.  Software problems, and hardware problems.  I have had my powerbook for a month now and smile everytime I use it.

But if you do buy one I recommend buying a protective case for it as well.  The casing gets finger prints on it very easily, and though mine has not gotten any scratches because I keep it in its case when I'm not using it, I could imagine it's finish getting scuffed.

The only other complaint that I have about this computer, and its a minor one, is it doesn't get the wi-fi range that my last laptop did.  It doesn't have horrible range, but there were places I could get reception with my last laptop that I cannot with this one.  But I guess it doesn't matter if you can get a signal if your laptop only works half the time.  I'll deal with the mediocre reception if I can have a computer that runs as good as an apple does.
I have owned this computer for a month now. Please research carefully before purchasing. Mine has faint lines on the display, of two types: diagonal ones (scrolling), and horizontal ones every other line of pixels or so. Seeing them depends on the calibration of the screen, the angle under which you look at the screen, how much you care and how good your eyesight is, but it's not subjective, the lines are there. I didn't notice them right away, I did think that the display was a little muddy compared to the previous 15" model with lower resolution I had used just before though, but I did also notice the lines after a few days and was shocked to find so many people describing the exact same behaviour when making a simple search on google for the keywords 'powerbook 15" horizontal lines'.

What is worse is that after a month, Applecare still acts like the issue is unheard of, urges me to send mine in for repair, but to the best of my knowledge, nobody, on any forums where users describe the issue,  has said they had sent their computer in for repair and it came back without the problem.

It is to wonder whether every PowerBook is affected, casual users might not care but based on 1) friends 2) visits to the local Appe store 3) online forums, it seems quasi general. The problem is obvious on mine, I have a good eyesight - and depend on my PowerBook for graphical work, and earn a living... so scrolling diagonal lines on light grey backgrounds behind text, scanline texture surimposed to any graphic, is not an option for me and is giving me headaches literally as well as figuratively (pun intended) and I sincerely don't know what to do as refund, resale, switching to a 17" is not exactly what I want to do if it is even an option with Apple for me at this point.

And contrarily to what some say no, I don't need to be two inches from the screen to see them, and I am looking at the monitor perpendicularly.

Other than that, small problems with the USB, it seems that I need to unplug and plug my external mouse for it to be recognised when the computer wakes up from sleep. I can live with that. Otherwise, great little machine...
First, the complaints, which are minor: The trackpad sucks. It's "jumpy" and when you drag the cursor diagonally it wiggles in a staircase pattern. Plus OS X doesn't provide a way to adjust its speed, only its acceleration curve. But even if you get some third party utility to increase the pixels per inch (like Sidetrack), it only emphasizes the defects in the trackpad. Fortunately I'll always be using a mouse with the thing.

My only other complaint is battery life seems a little shorter than advertised. I'm getting better than the miserable hour or less that others have mentioned, but still only in the 2-3 hour range. Of course, I keep my screen set pretty bright.

Now the good stuff: The higher density display is great because OS X's widgets are a bit oversized to begin with. So it makes them seem more normal. And I don't see the horizontal lines others have, maybe I just lucked out and got a good one.

I am a fan of the latest PC laptops and their glossy screens, I hope Apple offers that as an option at some point. But I prefer the widescreen aspect ratio of the Powerbook to the 4:3 of most PC laptops. And the Radeon 9700 in the Powerbook is way way better than the crummy 9200 in my Mac Mini. That thing has weird driver issues and doesn't support the latest OpenGL features.

The "two fingered scroll" is fine I guess on the trackpad, but would prefer the "single finger on the edge of the trackpad" scheme of my Fujitsu laptop. But since I'm not using the trackpad anyway I guess it doesn't matter.

Overall, I'm quite satisfied with the performance and usability of this my first Mac laptop.
I returned my first new 15" Powerbook (M9969LL/A) within three weeks because the battery literally only ran for 10 minutes on a full charge at that point. Now the second unit is only 3 days old and I'm only seeing a 1-hour battery life on a full charge! I'm obviously hoping (like others) that Apple will address this issue, because other than the battery problem I love this laptop. My 2-year old Thinkpad T42 still runs 2-3 hours on a full charge with full screen-brightness and no battery saving features turned on. I have not experienced any problems with the screen like other users.
I've been a loyal Apple user for about 15 years now.  Everything about Apple has always been cutting edge and way ahead of its time.  GUI, the iMac, the iPod.  As things like the iMac and iBook and iPod and anything else with "i" preceeding it has brought the Mac more and more mainstream, their quality has begun to slip.  iPods delievered DOA, G5's with cracked cases.  But Apple has always made good on these problems.  Now however, they have commited a horrible offense with this new Powerbook.

Apple claims these new Powerbooks have higher resolution screens.  And this is true, the screens resolutions are higher.  However, the 15" Powerbook has a major screen problem.  If you go into an Apple Store and look at all 3 laptops in the Powerbook family, you'll notice the 12" and 17" books have gorgeous displays.  However, the 15" screen has lines running across it.  The lines are very small and are very visible on Apple's default blue background.  Look for yourself and you will see.  Especially next to a 17" or 12".  However, this is not the greatest offense.

Many who have bought the new 15" powerbook have sent them back to Apple for repair or replacement only to be told their laptops are "within spec."  Apple is ignoring the problem.  Some people say they don't mind the lines.  And that's fine for those people.  But would you want to drop $2,000 on a top of the line laptop, only to get a screen you would normally see on a $700 laptop?  When you buy an Apple, you expect the best.  Now, they are delivering a substandard product and still charging top of the line prices.  And it gets better.

Some who have bought these new units have found responses to the problem quite comical. In Apple Stores they have been told such things as:

"What, it's a beautiful display.  I don't know what you're talking about."

"It's within spec." A personal favorite of mine.  But the best is:

"It's a new battery saving feature."  To which people respond,"How do I turn it off?"  "You can't."  "Well if it saves battery, why isn't it a feature on the new 17" or 12"." To which the so-called Mac Geniuses at the stores have no response.

I would never buy this product.  Not only that, but even if you have no plans on getting one, but are a loyal Mac user, you should let Apple know by calling them.  The more they hear from users, the more they will consider fixing the problem.  Even if you have one, see the lines, but accept dealing with them, just call Apple to let them know of the problem.
I have been an avid Mac user for quite some time.  In the course of the last 18 months I have owned the 12" Powerbook, 17" Powerbook and now the latest incarnation of the Powerbook, the 15" HD.  And I agree with Goldilocks, this one is just right!

What makes this just right?  The size and proportion are perfect, as is the weight.  And to make things even better, the features of the 17" have finally drifted down to the 15".  Primarily the increased screen resolution for higher definition, the 128 MB VRAM with dual DVI and the optical audio In/Out.  (You may not think this is huge, but hook this up to your stereo through the optical and you will hear a major difference.  It is also significant if you will be using this laptop for digital recording or playback with Garage Band, iMovie or other editing software.)  All-in-all, the 15" Powerbook has become the best value in the line-up.

With a 15" Powerbook only $500 more than the 12" Powerbook, the features are worth the extra money.

Features added to 15" Powerbook over the 12" Powerbook include; backlit keyboard, Firewire 800, 10/100/1000 Ethernet, 1.67 Processor, 128MB VRAM (vs 64MB VRAM in the 12") S-Video out, optical audio in/out, dual layer SuperDrive and a PCMIA Card Slot (Type I & II).  Break it down & each added feature cost about $45 each.  An excellent value indeed!

But the bigger question is whether the 17", for $500 more is worth the extra 2", 40GB hard drive and slightly higher screen resolution.  From my experience, most people use their laptop hooked up to an external display while at home, so the question of screen size might be a moot point, and above that make the 17" impractical.

if you need one more reason to buy the 15" Powerbook, here it is.  It is a piece of art.  Look at any Windows-based laptop and they are all plastic with lots of buttons and annoying stickers proclaiming the processor and other hardware inside.  Take a look at the Powerbook and you realize this is a excellent piece of functional minimalism.  Beauty and brains.  What a combination.

After using 13 laptops in the past 5 years, I can promise you that the 15" Powerbook is the best laptop you will ever buy.
This is a simply superb machine.  It's a Porsche of laptops, vastly classier and more sophisticated than Windows machines.  I'm a long-time Windows user, but am in the process of switching over to the Mac for all personal & most business use.

Tiger with its Searchlight function is a fantastic op system - at least a decade ahead of Windows XP Pro.  Yes, the machine is expensive, and no, it's not a gamer's machine, but for anyone who is creative, intelligent, and adult, there is no better choice.

Get the PowerBook.  Like me, you'll never look back.
Standard sony style display, good software comparing with the prior laptop models. Very poor battery life so if you are planning to use it while on travel ready to spare $300 for a new battery. Light weight, nice slick shape than the A150 model, great keyboard, nice looks.
THIS IS A GREAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT NOTEBOOK..

AFTER I ORDERED THIS THERE WERE ABOUT 20  PPL WHO ORDERED IT..
product died in 20 days. they have defective range of vaio products made in cheap contract assembly factories in China.

Their LCD HAS SHORTEST LIFE AND ILLUMINATION PROBLEM WITH CHINESE COMPONENTS.

THEIR FIRST SUPPORT OR CUSTOMER SERVICE COMES IN FORM OF AUTOMATED MESSAGES (RANTING) ONLY AFTER 7 DAYS TO 30 DAYS.REST ALL LOOPING TOLL FREE PHONES ONLY WITH RECOREDED VOICE. SONY DO NOT BELIEVE IN HUMAN INTERACTION AND THEY DO NOT GUARANTEE FOR ANY PROTECTION FOR THE COMPUTER THEY SERVICE, EVEN WHEN THEY WAKE UP AFTER A MONTH/S OF LOOPING CALLS. TEHY WOULD JUST FORMAT WHOLE HARD DISK, IRRESPECTIVE OF ANY RELEVANT PROBLEMS. I LOST MY LIFE'S MAJOR PROJECT DUE TO THEIR CHEAP PRODUCT.
I purchased my laptop about a week after this model came out.  I immediately swapped out a 256 stick of memory for a 1GB that I purchased online (as this laptop only has 2 slots).  I can't say I experienced a HUGE performance difference, but I do notice that it gets less bogged down when I have 3 or more programs open that hog system resources.

Processing Performance:  Boots up most programs in a flash.  Processing power is all relative to your usage, but I use this for web development (MX Studio) and there are no hiccups in performance.

Screen:  The screen was the kicker.  I have not seen a laptop screen so bright which comes in handy when I am viewing with ambient daylight.  It is crystal clear and a joy to work with spreadsheets and graphic manipulation programs alike.

Form Factor:  Very thin and well balanced.

Keyboard:  Excellent keys.  2nd only to my MacAlly IceKey that I use with my PC (that I have used).  There is a slight wiggle about the keys in their upright position that is better that most keyboards I've used.  It has a soft travel, not as crisp as mac/certain IBM notebooks I've used.  Still more than acceptable performance.

Speakers:  The only major downfall of this laptop.  The sound is average to slightly below, but volume sucks.  The location of the speakers (above keyboard) is not such a good idea when it seems as thought the speakers are aimed toward outerspace.  The stereo imaging is lacking as a result.  If you are a music enthusiast, this is a hard call.  Either get some good headphones, external speakers, or find another solution.  My 1999 Dell had the speakers on the sides and were aimed toward the user which created great stereo imagery and the tiny speakers were crystal clear.  With all the attention to detail the Japanese are notorious for, I'm surprised this got overlooked.  Good for your occasional background music nevertheless.

Build Quality:  On par for a 1k laptop.  Nothing to beat up, but will do well without any droppage.

Wifi:  Excellent range/performance.  Discard the preinstalled Sony junk software and use the built-in windows utility.

Mouse:  Do yourself a favor and buy a wireless notebook mouse for $20.  Well worth it.  I am proficient on touchpad, but I'ts inevitably cumbersome for most programs.

Everything else:  Pretty much not worth mentioning.  Everything else is trivial to me and works well for what it does.

Overall Recommendation:  Although they could have thrown in an integrated webcam, this is an excellent value for a laptop on the cheap.  If you are an audiophile, go look at this at Circuit City and evaulate from there.  Don't expect this machine to last 5 years with normal wear and tear, but do expect to be dazzled by the bang for your buck value.  Stay away from the XBRITE-ECO which is in the model below this as it only has half the lumens (screen brightness).
Bought one on the advise of a sales person. Nice screen. Excellent speed. Lightwight, and battery lasts about 2 hours.

However, audio is extreamly low. Screen is not as bright as I would like it to be.

Yesterday It took a 3 foot tumble while shut off. I turned it on and it ran great..

Then I went to work and returned home and it ran great. Then after sitting there over night, I turned it on  this morning and got "operating system not found".

Sure glad I bought a service agreement. On the other hand, I needed this for a chrismas vacation, and now don't have a laptop. Next time, Im going with a HP Pavalon.

The viao case, while plastic and light weight, doesn't allow for much bouncing, I suppose.
I bought a Vaio laptop in June 2003 with a 1-yr warranty. I loved it. Product died in month 13 due to failed memory socket.  Did a search on internet and found many users with similar story. I offer the advice to do your research before you buy a high priced item like the Vaio.  I'm sorry I got carried away by the glitz and glamour of this beautiful but troublesome laptop.
I ordered accessories for the product that came with no documention on how to use them (the AV docking station).

Really, no documentation to start it up.  Box had seals brocken.  Sony support told me that I would have to go to their web site and read the documentation.  They then informed me that said documentation was what I had.  A 1 page documentation on the ports in the back.  None of this was specified in the 1 sheet documentation I got with the accessories.

Next day I powered up the laptop and it couldn't find the hard drive.

So, Sony will contact me within three days to set up an appointment within the next 7 days to look at the latop which is now unusable.  It does not recognize that there is a harddrive in the system.  A PC 38 days old.

The total time I have spent on resolving this is over five hours and many calls on my cell phone.

My take on Sony products is that the documentation is abysmal.  There are other products out there with better documentation and support.

And this is coming from someone who used to love Sony products.

I am off now to pick up a new notebook.  I need to have a laptop for a Monday presentation for my new business.  I know the laptop will not be a Sony.
This laptop is very user friendly, and an enjoyable peice of equipment. The battery life is
great, as well as memory capability; however the price is too expensive. (...)
I bought my Sony Vaio Fs742 from a bricks and mortar store (BB)

I fell in love instantly! Great DISPLAY. It's awesome, very bright and crisp, better than my TV. I found the speed to be a bit unimpressive. I've had a DELL (hate that company) Inspiron 1100 that I've had for two years and the speed seemed about the same. The styling is great on the Sony and gets a lot of compliments. I found the buttons on the mouse pad thing awkwardly small. I had this machine two weeks, to the day, and the screen went out. I was very dissapointed. I ALMOST bought another one, but I've heard several other stories about the screens acting up from the Geek Squad. I think next time I will buyer a cheaper, more utilitarian machine. I am very dissapointed that the Sony wasn't a better machine, I loved everything else about it, other than it's lack of an S-Video port. If you buy one good luck and get an extended warranty, you'll end up using it.

It's also too expensive for what you get. It's like my Motorola Razor, looks good, but not practical.
I finally got the FS742/W after pondering over it for more than a month. I was looking forward to the new FJ170/80 series that just came out last month with a smaller footprint and a slightly faster hard drive.

However based on a lot of reading I did over the web, the FS700 series seemed to give the best value for money. From reviews and personal observation, the build quality is great, the screen is genuine X-Brite (and not the eco-Brites as on the FJ170s) and the difference is so obvious when compared to my older Sony LCD lying next to this notebook. The keys are great in addition to general peripherals lay-out. I would have preffered one of the USB inputs to be on the other side, and not all 3 together to the right side - just a personal preference.

I did however get additional memory (bought one 1 gig module to replace the 2 X 256 mb that comes with it). The current drive at 4200 rpm is OK and not a major concern (I have read the faster drives make more noise). Also formatted the notebook (REMEMBER to create the restore DVDs first) and then re-installed Windows OS using the first restore DVD. I then manually installed most of the needed drivers using the second DVD and un-installed anything in there I did not find useful. I still need to clean it up a bit and get the 2 Function buttons to work again (when I get some time). I watched a 2.5 hour DVD movie on it last night and the battery was completely drained by then.

In addition to the extra memory, bought myself a Silver corded optical VAIO mouse that goes very well with the silver/white exterior of the notebook. I have ordered the VAIO notebook AMC3 sleeve just incase I want to pop it into a messenger bag. I am not a serious gamer so the integrated video is not an issue for me. I've had it for a week now and am glad I made the right decision ( based on price and also comparing it looks wise to all the other notebooks on display at retail stores).
This is my second notebook. last one I bought in summer 2004 was toshiba A45-s250. this one is nice and stylish. however nothing is perfect and so is this machine. sony fills up every notebook with there crappy and buggy software which eats up your RAM and keep on sitting there until you don't uninstall 90% of the junk. I think a message needs to be send to all notebook assemblers that please do not install crap on notebook and let the user decide what he/she wants.

anyway as far as machine is concerned after uninstalling lot of junk this is working great. I wish it'd have bluetooth though and double layer dvd writer should have supported dvd-r DL as well since nowadays it is becoming common. another issue is sony does not provide restoration disks so you have to make one yourself.

as far as display is concerned its pretty impressive. I tried playing quicktime HD trailers and even though the playback was bit jerky you can easily make out the depth of display.

another thing which I think sony should have given apart from all the software is direct transfer of videos to PSP in avc/h. 264 format as bundled mpeg4-sp is not very impressive.

anyways machine is a good perfomer after tweaking.
I was reluctant to spend the premium you pay for the Sony name, but now I have no regrets. I tried Toshiba and HP machines in the same price range that had better specs, but the build quality (especially the keyboards) and looks weren't in the same league as the Sony Vaio. The keyboard is solid with a good feel. The touchpad is great. The screen is bright, the colors are brilliant, and it feels sturdy when opening and closing it. I mostly use it for wireless internet surfing, email, office tools and some games, and it's great for that. I don't rely on the battery much, so I can't comment on battery life, but I do know it's better than my IBM Thinkpad I use at work. All in all, I'm very happy with my Sony.
I was hesitant to buy a laptop that had as many bad reviews as good ones, but now I couldn't be happier with my laptop!  It runs more smoothly, reliably, and faster than my best friend's Dell laptop.  I admit that I paid a little more for this baby than my best friend paid for hers, but not by much.  The battery life was for only about an hour, but it said that in the product specs, so I wasn't worried about it.

I would imagine that there are plenty of people who have purchased this laptop and are perfectly happy with it who haven't left a review.  Normally, I am one of those people.
I've had my notebook for a while now and haven't had any problems with it. The dvd burner feature is pretty fast and the sound is pretty good as well. The performance is just as good as mid-low desktop pc's. Don't know why the people below have had problems, maybe they're just beginners with comps (by the looks of their problems, lol). I'd recommend a toshiba satellite for others.
My brand new Toshiba M45-S169 laptop has a battery life of <1 hour!  If I had known that Toshiba was selling the M45-S169 with a substandard battery, I would have selected a different computer.  Toshiba fooled me.  Shame on them.  I'll never buy another Toshiba product.
This is my second Satellite and I can see it has improved from the last one. It is pretty fun to play around with, but it is hard to say anything bad when you get something for free, (...),i know it looks like a scam but my friend did it and his actually came, I sat there and played with it and said wow, and gave it a shot and  now I am happy I did.
This is a nice notebook -- when it works.  Like many people with Toshiba laptops, this model has a problem where it shuts off when it feels like it.  Sometimes it restarts, sometimes not.  Within two months of having it, it had to be sent away for repair, and now, after being back for about 3 days, it is still shutting off for no reason.

Research indicates there could be a cooling problem or a static problem.  Toshiba is aware of these issues, and supposedly there is a lawsuit being brought against them because they refuse to address the issue.

I'm going to try to get my money back, but I'm not hopeful.
Did you get scared from some of the previous reviews? I had mine for over a year with tons of software, many external drives, carried it back and forth, bumped it a few times, installed many non-compatible drives and programs, upgraded it a few times and so on and so foth... Why did somebody have problems with it? I have no idea... I think some people spill coffee on it in the first few days and them say: I don't know why... or I don't know what happened... I also don't understand why such a good piece of Japanese electronics gets such low marks. For me it works just perfect. No flaws, screen is great.
Maybe it's just me.  I think a $1000 machine should be able to make it at least a few months of gentle use without dying on you.  For the general user, this machine has a great combination of features, and it worked well and fast for the month it actually worked; the screen was beautiful.  One day I shut it off and the next time, beep beep beep.  It is now on its way to the service center.  Maybe it will resuscitate, maybe not.  Generally, when a machine eats dust this quickly it doesn't bode well for the long term.  Customer service was very good and efficient -- Toshiba has warranty contracts with UPS Stores to pack & ship them back at their expense, so it was an easy process.  Much better than HP, where I had to pack my own box and wait at home for pickup (slower though).  I'm beginning to think that to buy a laptop you need about $5000 -- enough to go through 4 or 5 of them until you get one that lasts. I had an HP and the Toshiba both turn belly up, and the little generic cheap-o laptop at work just keeps humming along... go figure.

(later adddition ...) Well, the repair held and this machine continues to perform perfectly.  I know it is no longer available, but I'm adding this just to be fair to Toshiba.
I was buy this great notebooks, with Wide Screen is perfect for today notebook.

The Screen is very cleary, the sound is amazing for notebook.

But I have some litle trouble. Is about hybernation. Everytime I close lid my Notebook. It go to hybernate, but sometimes this notebook Turn ON it self without I do something. This notebook Turn ON. What happen whit this?

So if I don't want this notebook AUTO ON, I give my notebook belt after I close lid, and the problem solved. Does anyone else have this trouble? and how to fix it?
My husband is a computer consultant, and we have had it with these computers.  They seemed to be the best deal each time we were in the market for a new laptop, but don't waste your money.  I have one that is 2 years old, and it shuts down from over heating about every hour.  My husband gave me that one after giving up on it and buying a new one, and it over heats, and about twice a day when he puts his hands back on it to start working again, it dies.  And it REALLY dies, it takes a lot of time to get it going again, and a couple of times (including yesterday) it died and took all day to get it going again normally.  Don't buy these computers.  They really suck.  We gave it a second shot, and it is just not worth it.  It has cost us a fortune in missed work because of its faults.  We called Toshiba about his current laptop issues, they said they were aware of the problem, and just bring it to a local Toshiba technician, and they will fix it for free, but will have it for 2 weeks!  2 weeks!  That is crazy!  Hope this saves you the hassles these computers have caused us.
I received my order today and the seal was broken! Having read the reviews I asked Amazon twice before buying about the seal and they did not give a straight answer, just said that " they will take full responsibility if something is wrong". I asked them to let me know if they ship open boxes, to avoid having to return the item.

I reported the issue to Sony, they will investigate with Amazon.

As far as I know it is illegal to advertize and sell open boxes as a new product.
mine was sealed. no problem. amazon is always a 5-star in my book!  this notebook is great!
Iam writing this review not because the laptop didn't function properly etc but because THE SEAL ON THE SONY BOX WAS ****BROKEN**** and yes, I did read other reviewers comments but I guess I was overoptimistic. The computer looks, feels new but how does it matter?? I know for a fact that it was opened before it got to me so who knows how long this is going to run??

I bought this peice as a gift for someone and I don't have time to do the returns and exchanges. But I would feel very frustrated if there is a defect with the laptop and it stops working for that reason. What would be pathetic would be if amazon knew that these laptops are returns and may have a problem but are still selling them. That sucks..
I love the computer, but had the exact same problem buying from Circuit City. I ordered online and went and picked it up and did not inspect it close enough. when I got home and went to open it, I noticed the seal had been broken on the box! The computer had not been turned on or set up and everything looked and performed perfectly and like new but I fould it strange, especially after reading the open-box comments here.
I met the same problems as the other did. The seal  of SONY on the box was broken. Obviously, some people returned it to Amazon. After checking all the items in box, nothing wrong. I decided to keep it and not return to Armazon. After running it fot two days, the machine works fine. I like it. Of course, the Amazon price is still very competitive and attractive. But if you would not like to take the risk, just try other shops.
I 'm staying away from Amazon on this Laptop unless they can post an explanation to the customers below !!
I ordered this laptop from Amazon despite reading the warning in the review below and indeed received an OPEN BOX!!

I am sending it back too and am not sure if I will receive an NEW unopened laptop if I was to reorder.

I wonder if any one in customer service can assure me this?
Generally, I like this laptop.  Everything is perfect such as display, weight, and heat release.  But don't buy it here.  Why?  because I got an openbox laptop.  Need to ship it back and exchange for a unopen one.
I almost bought this computer, but decided to go to Best Buy to actually see it. I am very glad I did: the Best Buy's floor sample had many glass cracks on the LCD panel. I wondered why, and the answer is actually simple: the screen is made very thin and while the "polycarbonate" cover touted by Sony is strong in terms that the cover itself does not break, at the same time it is very flexible and unfortunately the glass inside the screen is not flexible, so the LCD glass cracks when the screen is bent a little.

So, I imagine the glass would often break if you put your computer inside a bag with something else that could bend-in the cover or if you drop it or you are not handling this thing like a baby. None of the other computers I saw in Best Buy had the cracks on LCD panels. So, if you ever decide to buy it, I would highly recommend buying an accidental damage protection, which adds $300-$500 to the price depending on where you buy it.

I also looked at Portege R200 from Toshiba. The battery life of this computer is not as impressive as Sony's and it lacks the optical drive. On the plus side it weights the same and has a much better protection of its Polysilicon screen - it does not bend and the Polysilicon screens are known to outlast the regular screens by many years. Sony might also use polysilicon screens, but unlike Toshiba they refuse to tell which components they use, which is unfortunate because you don't really know what you are buying and how long will it last. One of the reasons I looked at Sony's TX is that it might use the polysilicon screen from Toshiba, based on Toshiba's announcement of mass production of LED powered 11.1 screens with the same resolution as in TX. That screen would work very well if not the critical design flaw with the screen cover that bends easily.

The Portege's hard drive also seems to be very well protected:  they used a smart sensor that detects abrupt laptop movements and parks the hard drive's head to avoid damage to the disk. Not only that, it is also installed in a shock absorbing material. The hard disk and the screen are the two components that break sooner or later 99% of the time and Toshiba wins the durability test against Sony hands down. So, regretfully, while Sony's TX looks great, I just can't waste my time and money on something that would break in a few months.

As far as the WAN option goes, the Cingular's web site sells the PCMCIA cards for free when you sign up, so having the WAN option built-in does not make much of a difference pricewise.
I just bought a TX690, which I believe is the same as this model except with a blue cover and a half a gig more RAM.

Light, thrifty with the juice, and just as powerful as some of its larger cousins, I am very happy with this purchase overall. I can see no reason to go back to a bigger notebook for any reason.  It fits in a backpack with the rest of my gear; no need for a separate laptop bag.

The connectivity is superb, and once you get the hang of it, the VAIO connections manager software makes it incredibly easy to switch from one internet connection to another.

The Cingular EDGE feature is extraordinary.  You can pluck broadband out of the sky across wide stretches of the USA--no more searching for Starbucks or other hotspots. And if the EDGE network doesn't reach where you are, the Bluetooth feature makes it easy to do dial up via your mobile phone.

Just a couple of gripes that bust my rating from a 5 to a 4.

Sony has integrated the EDGE system into the software, so you can't switch telcos.  And with the most common plan at $80 a month, it's a bit pricy.

The screen is exceptional for its size, and the keyboard works as well as can be expected in such a small space.  But Sony could have improved the array of outside controls.  There's a set of buttons above the keyboard which is supposed to let you operate the machine as a dumb-terminal personal DVD player without booting up the whole system, but it's never worked 100% properly for me.  The touch-pad is, if you'll pardon the expression, touchy.  And the volume and mute buttons are fiddly.

The tight packing of so many components does cause a little interference in the built-in speaker--this disappears when connected to external speakers, but it kind of makes it useless as a personal DVD.

That said, if you really want a full functioned office that you can operate from anywhere, you can't go past the new TX series.
This is my first Sony notebook and I love it. I have always had Thinkpads. This is the pefect size and weight for a business traveller like me.
Sony Vaio's are a defective product and should not be sold.  Once you have a problem customer service/repairs/refunds are non existant and they repeatedly get you off the phone telling you that they will have someone call you back.  Never yet a call back! DON'T buy the Sony  Vaio and if you do or have please file a complaint with the BBB online.
I recently purchased this from Amazon.  They offered an OK price, but also gave a $150 rebate, so the net price was about $60 less than any other vendor (online or brick-and-mortar).  Filling out the rebate form on-line was easy.

I purchased it to replace a Fujitsu p1120 sub-sub-notebook.  The LCD on the Fujitsu died just outside of the 1-year warranty.  I expect the Sony LCD will last longer, given the quality I usually find in Sony products.  The Sony is much faster (as one would expect comparing a Pentium M 1.2 GHz processor to a Transmeta 0.8 GHz processor), and has a much nicer screen.  It comes with the usual Windows/MS junk such as MS Works, MS Office Evaluation Copy, etc.  I deleted these to make room for OpenOffice for Windows and Cygwin.

Regarding recovery disks, they can be made easily by following the instructions that appear after you first log in.  It is true that 6 GB of disk space is devoted to a Windows Recovery Partition.  This partition can probably be deleted after making recovery disks, but this would likely require a re-install of Windows.  I have not done this.  I did shrink the Windows partition using Knoppix and installed Fedora Core 4.  It works well with Linux, including screen, touchpad, sound, and wireless.  I am told power management works under Linux, but haven't yet tried it.

I do not believe the screen is as fragile as some reviewers fear.  A co-worker has 2 of these (for herself and her husband) and says she and her kids have treated it quite roughly without any screen damage.  Moreover, I went down to the local CompUSA and saw the screen on one of their demo models torqued significantly without damage to it.

I am so far happy with this notebook.  If I had not yet purchased this notebook, I would also look at the Panasonic Toughbooks.
I have had my TX for 2 months and had the pleasure to travel with it. Battery life is excellent. I did add 1 gig of ram. Dragon Naturally speaking works well desopite the low power processor. The Cingular connection works but after using a broadband connection, it just a little bettter than dial up, but you do have a much expanded area of internet connectivity. The fan is a bit noisey. The bluetooth works well with my Dell Axim.

If you want to watch a movie on a plane, the volume is better in the windows mode than the AV mode. Over a very delightfull travel companion.
I've had my TX-650 for about 3 weeks. The first thing I did was put a 1GB RAM card in to boost the total RAM to 1.5GB. It's easy to do yourself and for less than $100 is worth in in better performance.

Overall I have been pretty happy with the device. The screen is very nice, the size and weight are just perfect. The keyboard is as good as you are going to get in a ultraportable. The battery life is superb. I have had occasion to use the wireless LAN a lot and the reception is excellent. I also subscribed to the Cingular EDGE WWAN plan and the speed is poor but better than nothing if you are stuck without a WLAN nearby.

I'm not happy with the lack of restore disks and the fact that a fairly large part of the HD is taken up by restore files and thus unusable.

I've also had intermittent problems with the sleep/hibernate feature causing lock-ups.

Another negative is the fan noise. Expect the fan to run at least 50% of the time if you use it for longer than 10 minutes.

Overall a great little notebook and I would buy it again.
I've had my computer for about 2 months now, and I have had to restore the system twice.  It's really frustrating to have to continuously back up and reload documents.  There is something a little unstable about the OS, but I haven't quite figured it out yet.  I'm not a real fan of Nortons and it does come with the software package, but it would be unfair to blame it on them, but...

Anyway, the computer itself, when working, is awesome.  You can't beat the size and weight.  The AV mode is great.  You can play a CD or DVD without booting Windows.  My kids love it on long car trips because they can watch movies.  The battery life is incredible and there are even a couple of games (Call of Duty) that you can play on it, which is unusual for laptops due to their less than adequate video cards.

If I were to do it all over again, I would be looking at Toshiba.  I've had a few and they never gave me any problems.  I don't know why I chose Sony, but I did and I am semi-satisfied.  Their customer service has been pretty good.  That's more than I can say for other computer companies.  Again, it's not a completely horrible system, but do your homework and know what you want it for to make sure it fits your needs.  I'm putting up with it because it's what I need... small, light and very portable, with a battery life that is incredible.
Note that there is a TX310 for $300 less if you can do with switching a DVDRW for a CDRW/DVD player. I would have purchased the TX310 myself but I was on a tight timeframe and none were in stock.

Now to the review ...

There is a lot to like about this TX line if you want ultraportable - mainly great screen, weight, and battery life.

I bought this for my wife who was very specific about what she wanted, which narrowed it to two choices as of 2/1/2006, Sony TX and Averatec 1000.

She preferred the Sony, and I understand why, but I would never pay the premium this one commands - the Averatec is 90% the same laptop at 50% of the price ... you basically loose

  - battery life (3.5 versus 5.5 hours)

  - a tiny bit of screen size (10.6 versus 11.1)

  - screen quality (though the Averatec is very good, but the Sony is excellent)

  - some weight (2.7 versus 3.4 lbs).

  - DVD burner (who cares - my desktop has one, and this is a $25-50 feature these days)

  - Bluetooth and Edge - I can add Bluetooth for $100 and use my phone as the modem, so decide if this is important to you.

Since I almost always plug into a wall and the other differences were so small, I felt I was paying $150 per ounce or $200 per 0.1 inches ...

I also slightly preferred the Averatec keyboard, though it was not a decision point.

I also thought the Averatec seemed a little sturdier, though this is highly subjective.

Also, note that I read one review (before buying) that said the Averatec had worse speakers - I listened to both side by side and disagree - they both have very little volume and while the Sony was MAYBE a little clearer, the Averatec was a little louder which I would judge more important, given how weak the volume of both were ... I don't actually care about this since I would typically use headphones if watching a DVD, but if you care then check it out and decide for yourself.

As it typical with Sony it is way overpriced. It certainly represents quality, but definitely not quality-value (e.g. it is rolls royce, not mercedes). I calculate that the extra features of the Sony are worth ~$200.

The TX line also appears easy to break, sticks you with Cingular for the highly touted EDGE connectivity (I like Cingular, but why no choice in GSM data services - more to the point, if you are going to force Cingular then why not negotiate special pricing for your users).

It has the typical crappy Sony graphics (which practically defines Sony Computer in my mind). Why does Sony think no users play games even though half of game players are solid income educated people between 25 and 45 years old ...?! The Averatec was no better on this score, but for >$1000 less I'm more forgiving.

The part I REALLY find hard to accept are little issues such as (1) does not ship it with recovery disks, which I expect in the $1150 Averatec but not the similar $2200 Sony, and (2) Sony loads it with a ton of crap software (AOL, Netscape, ...) that I have to go through and remove, which they give you no quick and easy way to do. I spent the first 4 hours cleaning up the machine and making recovery disks ... This is not what the user experience for a premium priced manufactuer should be like!

Because it is easy to break, I am trying to buy the Sony extended service plan (my retailer only sold their own plan for twice as much). So far I have not found a way to purchase the plan through Sony after the fact, but I am told they will mail me an invite to do so ...

I stopped buying Sony about 12 years ago because I thought their marketing people had screwed up a great company with overhyped overpriced products - this laptop exactly meets my expectations for Sony.

Good luck!
This is the fourth Sony mini laptop I have owned. The prior two were more impressive upgrades to their predecessors in my opinion.  I have had a VGN-TR3, and two different models from the T (not TX) series.  While I am still happy with the unit and find it to be definitely ultra-portable, I am less in awe of this upgrade than the others.

Few annoyances:

-the antenna for the Cingular access is annoying if you don't have the service (it is useless in my area, so the antenna is simply in the way).  Since this one pivots unlike the fixed to the monitor T series antenna, it is more apt to be caught on things.  Would love to be able to remove it until such time as service is available here

-the button on the DVD drive is insanely small and under the lip of the drive.  Useless without picking up the side of the laptop to see it and then pressing it with a pen or other small object.  There is another button to serve this purpose next to the DVD controls near the screen hinge which works fine, however, it is hard to re-train yourself not to look for the button on the drive

-for some reason one of the USB connections has now been put behind a cheap rubbery plastic door, which simply makes it harder to get to.  My experience with these doors is they eventually don't close properly and just hang.

Some questionable things:

-the screen is definitely much thinner on this model than those prior.  While I have never had an issue with any model having screen problems and don't expect to with this one, the hinges on it are looser and it pivots much more easily.  Not sure it would stay in place in a bumpy ride in a car or airplane

-while this current machine has more memory (1.5 versus 1.0Gb) than my most recent T series, and the memory is supposed to be faster, this machine is noticably slower than that model and probably the prior T series as well.  I actually compared the two side by side in an informal test to confirm this.  I have no explanation for this as everything but the memory is the same.

An annoyance with all the Sonys I have owned is the fact that they come pre-loaded with tons of software which I then have to remove.  Should you need to do a system recovery, you go right back to square one with all that software.  The system comes with no disks - everything is stored on a portion of the hard drive that is allocated for this purpose.

If you are in need of a protective case for this unit, the booq XXS Viper fits nicely.  I have found them to work well for these units - I regularly toss mine in a tote bag inside the case and have never had a problem with the protection provided.  Sony has very little for accessories available at this time - a battery and power cords last I knew.

Overall, this unit is a nice machine, as well all the predecessors, but I am not convinced I should have traded in my T series due to the speed issues.  If you want a small ultraportable machine with an exceptional clear screeen that is fairly powerful, however, this will do the job nicely.  I actually have SQL server running on this machine as I did with prior models with no noticable speed issues other than the fact this one is slower.  If you can find a better priced T series and don't mind a slightly smaller but thicker screen, however, that might be a better deal.  The 4 stars are a result of the annoyances in the new model.  I would give the T series 5, and would have give the TX a 5 if I hadn't owned the T.
This is Sony's new version of the T series. Unlike the T models, the TX models have a thinner screen, revamped keyboard and a cooler look. I really don't like widescreen LCD's on a laptop. Everything just makes it look squished and sometimes hard to read things. The screen is large enough to accomplish tasks that are internet and word based but not for like video editing or any kind of Photoshop stuff. This is however a perfect travel laptop with a 7.5 hr battery on HD, 4.5 running on a CD. The thinness on the screen makes it feel like its going to break if squished too tightly. The old T models had a thicker LCD which made it more carry accessible. The keyboard is great to type on (not for someone with big hands) and it has all the features you would expect in a laptop. Yes it does have a duel layer DVD burner but the button to open the tray is the smallest button I've have ever seen. You can also play DVD's without booting up windows.

Over all the laptop is great but not for everyone unless you really love small portable devices. This is great to have around if you want to draw attention to yourself. Weighing on 2.8 pounds (most of it being the battery) this laptop is great for car trips, school, plane flights and just a fast way to connect to the internet and check those normal items on the go.
It took me 2 months before deciding if i really wanted to get this. And at the end, i decided to go for it.

I went throught lots of reviews and most were very good except for a couple including the complaint about the screen and the noise/heat. As for the screen, so far, i've had it for 2 weeks and I've been moving from place to the other putting the laptop at the edge of my suit cases and it's still in perfect condition. However, the noise is really annoying and the heat is acceptable but still there. However, overall, I am still really impressed and don't regret at all buying it. The battery life and lightweight is WONDERFULL. seriously. it's like holding a small book in your hand. comparing to my old notebook this is amazing. and without the optical drive, the noise isn't as bad. I'm a student and I tend to carry my laptop with me a lot to school. So the lightweight, batterylife, and okay speed/processor was my main concern and this new buy did it all. I've like sony for a while, whether with cameras or computers and that's why I went for this (I think they are very user friendly) however there is a similar DELL one for about 400$ less and I would think your better off checking that one out too before going ahead and getting this another reason I also went for this one was that you can operate the DVD player without having to boot up the whole system which I think is really practical, esp when on long trips and wanting to watch something without having to waste all the battery.
This notebook is all about performance and portability. At under 3 lbs., I can hold it in one hand and type with the other with ease. It stays relatively cool, and the battery life is superior compared with other "travel" notebooks (buy the extended power extra battery and between the two you can work through a flight from LAX to Sydney without a jack). Its small without compromise, as it fits easily into a medium to large size tote-style purse (no bulky laptop bag) but is a true desktop replacement. If you've never owned a VAIO before, there is definite appeal to the streamlined case, solid feel, and soft touch keyboard. Sony knows how to make beautiful, high performance notebooks.

What you should know before you buy (not exactly negatives, but cautionary notes): Yes, the brilliant 11.1 in screen is wafer thin. I wouldn't call it delicate, but this is *not* a toughbook -- plan on handling with care. Its a little slow to boot because of the harddrive speed, and the memory is not as expandable as I would have guessed (I added another 512 to the 650P/B). This is *not* a gamer laptop (kind of a "duh") as the graphics card, HD speed, and memory are not suited for the newer highend game play. The TX Series is still fairly new to the market, so accessories are a little hard to come by. The only TX specific case I can find is direct from Sony, but I'm sure other vendors will catch up eventually.

If your priority is to find a true travel notebook that you can carry and use with ease, you can't do any better than this one.
Those three problems are my complaints of this product.  And it's quite likely that I will never purchase an apple laptop again after over 20 years of "apple only / mac addict / cult of mac".  I realized apple really is a cult of sorts and few of its products are worth even half their cost.

Specically of this product it was just heinously expensive.  People immersed in apple culture forget that 2 grand for a laptop is absurd.  You could get the most cutting-edge top of the line desktop pc for the same amount.

The Screen.  I do work with laptop resting up on knees while laying in bed at times, this screen clumsily doesn't stay up and collapse forward sometimes causing you to have to prop it up!

Finally, I lugged this behemoth piece of rubbish to two continents and it was basically a 6 pound brick I carried in my bags because of such short battery life and heavy physical weight.

The CPU performance is okay, but I'm not interested in apple OS anymore.

That anti-apple rant said, I do think their music products (like the shuffle and ipod touch) are very practically priced and lightweight and don't suffer from these problems (although the app store is too insular).  The ipad seems like a clunky-overpriced piece of rubbish as well.  So basically, I'm only likely buying apple music hardware products if any apple products from now on.  I realized what I was paying for was "cult membership", something I that doesn't interest me.

But that's a bit of a tirade, the main issues were INSANELY over-priced, collapsing screen, physically heavy, and dismal battery life.  I do not recommend this product unless you keep it on a desk and never travel with it, but then why spend money on a laptop?  This clunky piece of junk's software operates fine but if it's a massive burden on the pocketbook and travel's back, causing weight and battery and screen hassles, it's definitely not worth it and not a likeable product at all.
Two weeks ago my Dell died and I purchased the Apple MacBook Pro.  I honestly did not think that there would be such a major difference in the two, but boy oh boy do I feel like a kid in the candy store.  I am sold!  I have officially joined the Apple Bandwagon.
Well, since it says "How do you rate this item", I would give it a 5 star - Just for the sake of this laptop.

But no. I'm, uhm, slightly disappointed.

Where should I start? Disregarding the usefulness of this MacBook Pro, I'm currently having a little problem with it. Don't get me wrong, I fell in love with it right away (and I was a PC user until today.) Everything seems so enjoyable and delightful... And suddenly the number 4 key dropped off.

Imagine one of those "WTF!" moments. Yes, you know what I mean.

I have only been using this MBP for no more than 5 hours since I got it this morning, and this key fell off. Now I'm starting to wonder would the rest do the same, or should I just get an external keyboard? I saved almost 70 bucks buying this laptop on Amazon, and if I use this much money to get some instant glues, I can get more than a dozen.

(Instant glue helps, trust me..)

Now I'm going to talk to the Apple Support... And let's see what they say.
Laptop computer can't get any better than this. Mucho power in a small and gorgeous package!

This computer is fast. Very very fast. A AVI-MP4 video conversion took 34 minutes in my old MBP (duo 2 core) now take less than 10 minutes. The fan turned on during the conversion, but shut down shortly after that, as different graphic engine was used.

Of course, the screen is beautiful. I picked the glossy version because I think color is better than the non-glare version. All laptops should be built this way, until then, Apple continues to be the king.
I couldn't be happier with this piece of art, performance and speed.
I bought the mid 2010 version in april last year and I was satisfied and happy with my first Mac. Now I'm impressed with the speed and performance of this upgrade. Of course, I sold my 2010 Macbook pro to buy this one ;)
100% recommend this product!
This is my 4th MacBook 15 inch with my first one purchased in 2001 that came with the PowerPC processor. My last MacBook Pro was the late 2008 with the Core 2 Duo and it was a great laptop. My Core 2 MBP was still running great and I didn't have any major reason to upgrade but wanted to take advantage of the quad core that comes with the 2011 model. No doubt MacBooks are pricey compared to Windows laptops but in my opinion they are well worth it. Not only are they great laptops that don't show their age like Windows laptops but they also hold their value well. I generally hold onto my MBPs for 2-3 years and I have consistently sold them for very good money with my Core 2 Duo selling for $850 on ebay. That higher resale value makes any upgrade less painful considering the higher prices on the MBP.

The laptop itself is great and feels solid. The frame is no different then my Core 2 duo model but many other things are a nice upgrade. My favorites are:

1. Intel i7 quad core- can't say enough about having a quad core on a laptop. Now I can assign more cores to virtual machines I run on my MBP and when I rip dvd's to Apple TV format the conversion completes in 1/2 the time that my core 2 could do the work in.

2. AMD graphic chip- the thing I love about the new model compared to my old is how it can automatically switch between the built in Intel graphic to the AMD graphic chip. Older version of MBP forced you to manually make the change and logoff in order for the change to take effect. Now I can take advantage of the higher capacity AMD chip without having to remember to switch and logoff/on to gain the extra performance.

3. Screen- the screen on this version seems much nicer then my Core 2 model. Don't think the specs are different but the quality of the image is much better.

4. Thunderbolt- nice addition but will wait on judgement until I have a device that can take advantage of it. When that comes it will be nice to transfer files to attached storage at the thunderbolt speed compared to usb/firewire which will seem slow in comparison.

I almost didn't buy this model in order to try and wait another year to see if Apple does a major overhaul of the MBP frame next year but with the new features of this model the upgrade seems very much worth it if you need the extra speed and don't want to wait for any long term over hauls of the MBP line.
The update to the 15-inch MacBook Pro in February 2011 was significant.  Indeed, significant is an understatement.  Quick thanks to Amazon and Apple Stores for having these immediately available at launch.

The primary upgrade to this revision?  The processor!  Intel has a brand new architecture called Sandy Bridge, and these MacBook Pros are the first Macs to feature this technology. Some have called it some of the most significant changes to Intel architecture since Pentium 4 was introduced.  These 15-inch MacBook Pros as well as its big brother, the 17-inch, not only take advantage of Sandy Bridge, but the Quad Core i7 Variant.  Quad Core processor in a notebook Mac!  Wow.

I actually chose the 13-inch model for my personal use (only Dual Core on the 13-inch), but this 15-inch is replacing an aging iMac at the office to save space and leap over its performance.  These Quad Core Chips are amazing.  Early benchmarks are showing this entry-level 15-inch, 50 percent faster than the upper end i7 15-inch MacBook pro from a year ago.  A dramatic improvement.  Furthermore, if you're still on a Core 2 Duo machine such as the iMac I am replacing, the performance is as much as 2.5 times faster.  At least in terms of the processor.  This is most beneficial in processor intensive applications, for consumers such applications are iMovie and Garageband.  Professionals will see the new processors beneficial in any professional photo editing, video, or music work.

One downside is that due to cost, the machine still comes with a spinning hard drive standard.  In this case, the standard drive is a 5400 RPM 500 GB drive.  That offers plenty of storage, but is slightly slower than a desktop 7200RPM drive and much slower than a new, solid state drive.  You do have options.  You can special order the machine from Apple with a 7200RPM drive, or Solid State Drive.  However, what I have decided to do, is simply, when I'm ready, swap out the drive myself.  Other World Computing sells solid state drives compatible.  It might not be easy for every user, but for those with some computer experience, it is a fairly easy swap.  Then I can install a faster solid state drive, when the more acceptable capacity drives come down a bit in price.  You might also choose to do the swap yourself because you can then put the hard drive that was originally in the machine, into an external enclosure, and use it as an external drive for backup.  Of course, any damage you cause to the machine would not be covered under warranty.  Therefore, if you have any concern, you might want to see if you can special order from Apple online, or in many situations, you will find the standard hard drive to be acceptable.

After the processor advancement, Thunderbolt is the other great new technology included in this revision to the MacBook Pro.  Thunderbolt looks like the Mini Displayport that was already included on the MacBook Pros.  Indeed, it will still function perfectly as a Mini Displayport, for connecting an external display.  However, Thunderbolt is more importantly a new interface to connect external devices in the future, such as, external hard drives, HD camcorders, and perhaps even iPads, iPods, or iPhones someday.  Data would then transfer many times faster to and from these devices than it does currently.  These devices were not available at the time of the MacBook Pro's launch, but we have already heard that external drives should be available later this year with Thunderbolt connectivity.

iSight camera has been upgraded to HD resolution and Face Time pre-installed on the computer.  This gives you the ability to video chat, easily, with other Macs and notably, iPhone 4s and the newest iPod Touch with front facing camera.

The consumer software you expect to be included by Apple is once again here.  The latest version of Mac OS X Snow Leopard (operating system), iLIfe 11 including iPhoto, Garageband, iMovie, iDVD, and iWeb is all here.  OS X always includes Safari web browser, iTunes, and Mail applications too.  The average user would be good to go out of the box.  You might pick up Microsoft Office for your office document needs, or simply purchase Apple's iWork applications (Pages, Numbers, and Keynote) from new Mac App Store on your computer.

The new MacBooK Pros, thanks to Sandy Bridge technology are fast.  They will save you time, when using processor intensive applications.  Time in business, saves people money and frustration.  The average consumer might see less gains with this update as physically the MacBook Pro has retained it identical appearance, size, and weight.  Nevertheless, under the unibody, improvements have certainly occurred which result in a much faster notebook.  The fact that these 15-inch and 17-inch models now include Quad Core Processors standard is really extraordinary.  This is putting recent top of the line desktop performance, into a sleek and attractive Mac Notebook.  A breakthrough.  Recommended Product!
Love my MacBook! This is an amazing product
I ordered 2 of these for Christmas presents and sent one back immediately because the display was wonky when I started it up. The other appeared to work well and I sent it to my daughter overseas. Now she tells me the screen is all green and pixelated.  I know you always are taking a chance with a used machine but the track record for this is bad.
It worked fine for the 1st six months; however before developing video projects and running media assignments the hard-drive crashed.  It literally crashed when completing Microsoft Word and Excel assignments on Blackboard.  It was purchased in July, 2016.  Since then I have replaced the hard-drive twice and LOST VERY VALUABLE DATA before being transferred to the external hard-drive !!!  It would freeze up and would be a pain with some projects.  Its now December, 2017 and Im looking at purchasing a BRAND NEW one so my senior portfolio doesnt get corrupted.  All Digial Media students use MACs and no one had problems like me.  SAVE YOURSELF from STRESS, HARD-ACHE, & PAIN !!!  Just save your money....and PURCHASE a NEW ONE one on apple.com with the EDUCATION DISCOUNT and APPLE CARE PLAN.  Purchasing a used one can be a HIT or MISS....and this was DEFINITELY A MISS !!!
Very poor product w/ lots of technical issues and problems, fixing the machine will cost more value of machine. Did not feel anything is working on the machine.
I got a great working product, there were dents and scratches on the outside but nothing to bad and the computer screen and keyboard work great. The ram is working amazingly as well, loading and running products as it should. Definitely a great way to get a Mac without dropping $1,500
Bought this product for the price saving. Never had a problem with the product.
The right product as anounced, right delivery timing
Wifi never really worked and died with in 4 months
Sucked
The battery runs out really fast
I would like to promote the Apple Macbok Pro 15.4" Computer on my unboxed page. We would love to receive different products to display, we will have showing for you to see.
looks and performs like a brand new MacBook. I have always wanted one but could never afford one. For less than a third of a new one.
I only rated it this low for one reason. I got the laptop and I was impressed. A great price and everything was perfect... two weeks of having it and the laptop battery suddenly only works when plugged in. Doesn't do me much good as I travel for work and while finishing my MBA.
THEY SOLD ME A MACBOOK THAT WAS A PART OF AN APPLE RECALL PROGRAMME.

Apple had a recall on 2011 MACBOOK PROS because of a bad graphics card problem, that recall ended Dec 2016. With this problem, your screen starts to glitch, programs jump to one side of the screen, then lines start to appear in the screen and then when starting up, it restarts constantly, so you can't even log in, it just constantly restarts. When this happens you have to replace the ENTIRE logic board, which just happens to be just the same cost as the cost of the laptop if not more $400 - $600 NOT including installation costs.

As a computer seller it would be pretty weird if JMAC didn't know about the recall, and it seems as if they chose to ignore that recall and also didn't bother to do their own checks on the laptop on the state graphics cards or anything. They just hoped that which ever fool decided to buy this laptop, would do so at their own risk and they prayed that they laptop wouldnt start giving problems till AFTER their 30 day warranty, and I guess they lucked out and I didn't because two months after purchase, I am stuck a dead laptop that cannot be used, and will have to spend MORE money to purchase a new one.

I took it in to an Apple care technician who told me that my 2011 Macbook Pro has a bad logic board (the logic board is the thing that runs the entire computer). Apple had a Recall & repair programme on 2011 Macbooks because of bad logic boards. This programme ended Dec 2016. So I have no warranty or coverage from Apple, and because this is happened ONE MONTH AND SEVEN DAYS after JMAC warranty is expired, I have to take my losses and accept that I have been scammed out of $600.

The technician mentioned that there is a by pass around the issue - they can disable one of the two graphic cards and it work work fine - but surprise surprise BOTH graphic cards are bad. He did give me the option of buying another logic board, but that is roughly the same price as the TWO MONTH OLD LAPTOP!

I reached out to Jmax to request a refund/return, as I don't think that an item that has been recalled by Apple should made available for purchase. They denied my claim because the 30 days warranty had passed; IF ONLY I had known that a month after the warranty was up, that I would be the owner of a dead laptop and have to fork out an additional $500 to buy a new logic board for the laptop I have had for ONLY two months, If only!

I am a graphic designer, I need a laptop to earn my living, so not only have I lost some of my work as some of it didn't make it be backed up in Time Machine, I have bene unable to do any work for the past week and I am now forced to purchase another laptop to get my work done.

I feel like I have been scammed by this seller, who posted a faulty laptop on Amazon and hoped for the best that by the time the faulty logic board showed itself, it would be after the 30 days warranty, in this case they lucked out and I am stuck with a bad apple, literally.

This laptop should never have been made available for sale, Jmac sells laptops, as a seller of laptops I would find it very strange for them to not know about the 2011 Macbook recalls, so having known about it, it is dishonest and underhanded to sell a laptop to an unknowing customer will be duped out of their money TWO MONTHS AFTER PURCHASE. At the very least they could have mentioned that there was a manufacturers recall on the make and model and that if purchased it should be with the knowledge that there could be issues in the future. This is what was mentioned in their sellers notes:
Condition: Used - Good - i7 - 2.2 Ghz (MD318 Late 2011) \ 8 GB Memory \ 750 GB Hard Drive \ 621 CHARGE CYCLES \ Flash macOX 10.12 Sierra. Overall: 8.5 / 10. It had scratches on top and bottom cover, tear and wear on 4 corners. Including 85W MAGSAFE CHARGER and 30 days defect warranty. Will ship with the signature confirmation in the same or next business day after clear payment. #861

On August 15 when they denied my request for a return/refund, I sent them a follow up email asking them what recommendations do they have in regards to this dud of a laptop, they are yet to reply to me. It is not Aug 18, and I still have not heard from them.

I have filed two claims already and both have been denied because of the warranty, even though I will be protesting it as I find it very unfair that the unit was available for sale knowing the manufacturers recall on it, and I will be going into full detail in my claim, but from the looks of things it seems as if I have no choice but to accept the loss, and come to terms with having wasted $584 on a laptop, and that I will not be able to get any work done for a while, at least until I am able to purchase a new laptop.

Save yourself the money, the headache and the frustration.

DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!!!

Had a few dents and scratches but other than that definitely worth the money I'm taking college classes on it right now and it works perfect and runs fast!
thanks for asking . a little slow starting up . it seem to be working ok except one in a while it will stop and say it is being hack. and then nothing will work . pray that there is no one able to cause me problems. thanks again.
They laptop don't work no program on it.. now I'm  stuck with this laptop never again I'm better going right to a best pay or a  pawnshop to buy a use mac laptop
By far the best laptop I have ever owned in my lifetime, the people I purchased from were exact in there description, the product was used, but looks and runs like it was new. Would purchase from them again in a heartbeat.
Came wrapped 10+ times in bubble wrap. Non-Apple charger. Worked great for about two weeks. Hard drive fried in two weeks. Emailed Open Electronics and they promptly sent me the WRONG size hard drive. After purchasing my own $75 hard drive and installing it, the computer STILL hasn't worked properly. If I try to turn the computer on, it gives me an Apple symbol with a bar below it that fills up halfway then freezes to a blank white screen. Worked once while it was broken so I tried applying the correct start up disk. Still won't do the internet recovery to install the programs to make it start up and function properly. Been waiting for almost a month to get it back from a computer store that doesn't know why it won't start.  THANKS FOR THE BROKEN COMPUTER I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.
That's the year of this computer
As described,works great
The best buy,
This laptop was great, everything looked well with the laptop, and my time machine backup worked on this machine, the only problem is that it overheats, I'm in the middle of working on a sound project and it just stutters and shuts down because it gets too hot while running 1 program.

Update:
Worked with the seller to get the item replaced, they were very helpful and quick to respond with no hesitation.  Sent working unit that is comparable to the previous representation of the first unit.  The second unit works well and I can say I am a satisfied customer!  When a company works hard with its customers to keep them gratified to continue shopping with them, this my fellow amazon shoppers speaks volumes in a digital world.
I received this computer with an unusually large dent in the cover hinge area. It did not fit the description," THE MACBOOK PRO IS IN GOOD CONDITION WITH SOME SLIGHT DENTS AND LIGHT SCRATCHES FROM NORMAL USAGE."  See attached picture. This dent is NOT from normal usage. It was an extreme dent. Shortly after receiving this computer, I began having shut downs with a final crash on March 4th. I love the size and programs that came installed on this computer, but I am extremely frustrated that the performance deteriorated so quickly after my purchase. I have contacted the seller for replacement.
The computer I purchased came on time. But it gets extremely heated and is slow. This is not what I expected.
My laptop works perfectly.  Shipping was fast. Thank you.
GREAT product and service! They even UPGRADED my RAM, and Hard Drive! I couldn't be HAPPIER!
THANK YOU!
Its crashed on me after about a year of use. Still pretty good.
Fantastic, it is everything they said it would be!  I would buy another from them tomorrow!
Worked perfectly and arrived as advertised.
So far so good, minor cosmetic scratches on bottom and normal wear and tear in other areas. I am happy with the purchase!
We got this laptop for a nice price.  We had a problem with the battery.  We took it to Apple and they said it was the battery.  The seller gave us the money back to buy a new battery, and the laptop has been working great ever since.
Great Machine Definitely would recommend this company
This computer is awesome.  The thing looks to me like it's brand new and everything works just as it should.
Exsprence was refreshing to have what you set out to do actually went well product is exactly what I needed very pleased
loses its battery quickly.
This company is complete garbage. They piece together used laptops poorly. I got this exact mac just over a year ago and is has completely crapped out and they won't respond to any of my messages. They had to replace one 2 weeks after I had it. The replacement on I have already needed replace the hard drive, ram, and battery! And it still has issues. Do Not Buy!
These guys suck. They only reply via email. Got a lap top with a whole row on they keyboard not working. Don't trust this buy new
The computer is working just fine, just getting adjusted to it will take more practice time.
This is working great!  Only takes a little bit of effort to get used to.
So far everything is working as sold! Wife loves the bigger screen.
We bought this computer after a lot of research on the seller and the brand, we've had it for 2 months, and the motherboard has already crapped out. We're told it will be $800 to buy a new motherboard, which is more than the original computer. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER! It's a waste of money you may as well buy a brand new laptop!
Didn't boot up when I received it. Sent back for refund, which took over a month to get.
I am an expert in computers. Excellent quality laptop. Upgraded to 16GB of 1333mhz ram (Patriot from Frys) without issue. Eventually I'll be going SSD 1TB as well but after the ram upgrade I don't even need it really. Best computer I've ever had and first switch to mac after 20 years of PC. No more overheating! No more freezing! No more crashing! I use mine for DJing full time and it works flawlessly without issue. The charger is magnetic and it holds battery life very well after breaking it in for a month or so. NO COMPARISON TO MY OLD HP which crashed randomly and the overheating got worse and worse even after replacing the thermal paste on the cpu and gpu it still ran hot and I had to be careful how many apps I had open especially if I was outside in the summertime doing pool parties, even with a EZ up above me. This computer is a workhorse and with the ram upgrade it can handle a full load without getting hot or even really warm. I realized later when I finally had an excuse to use my dvd drive that it was broken and just spit discs out, so I asked for a replacement and with excellent customer service I was set a new one right away. I may buy another one to build a second backup DJ kit soon. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
Very disappointed! I received a defective product sent it back to the seller which said when they received the product that I somehow switched the laptop. I would not by from individual contractors especially Macs to Love.
never worked correctly from day 1
Does everything I expected.
Satisfied!
I love the computer I use it every day. I prefer my mac book over my laptop.
I am an artist who gave up commercial art years ago but seem to be called to dive back into digital art and design, so I needed to upgrade from my economy pc laptop to something with real processing power. My partner helped me pick out the best used MacBook Pro for my budget. I purchased this 2011 model and installed a new solid state drive and additional memory and couldn't be happier. Honestly, I love the older models because I still use the disk drive and memory slot occasionally. I have been afraid to buy used computers in the past but amazon makes it so easy to find exactly what you are looking for with many listings and sellers to chose from. This purchase was a great decision and will eventually pay itself off.
I bought this a couple of months ago. Shipping took awhile. I have experienced many glitches since my purchase, including keyboard malfunction wherein it was completely unresponsive. One of the perks of this purchase was that MS Office was included. However, after a series of debilitating updates, MS Office was lost. Unreliable product overall. Doesn't look like it will last very long, esp for the cost. Can buy a new hp for less.
Awesome computer!!!
Met expectations Son very pleased with it
Purchased to replace a titsup machine for wifey. Decent deal.
Could not get in due to a password had it on lock, finally got it unlocked & had one problem after another. Everything was wrong it even had viruses MANY !!!!!!! Had to pay to get fixed from the start & still has problems. Do not buy unless you want a headache
I've had it for years and just keep updating.  However, I don't like Apple coming on to it and changing things without my approval--like changing my photos.
Excellent product .according the advertise

I'm so glad I bought this used Mac Book instead of a new one. It's works as good and maybe even a little better than my old one.  I would still be using my 2011 MacBook except the battery died completely, began swelling and warped the case. It was way out of warranty so no luck getting it replaced. Personally I hate the new MacBooks and would never spend that much on something with few ports and no DVD/CD drive. Call me old fashion but I still listen to books on CD and play movies on DVD.  Also the company, Hope computers, was very helpful and the laptop was packed very well.  The only problem was the signature required to pick it up, being in a rural area and working a full-time job made it difficult to get to the post office. But overall I'm very satisfied with my Mac Book Pro.
Review:
Bought the following MacBook from amazon refurbished:
Mac book pro 15inch early 2011
4gb dfr3 1067 MHz 204 pin . First time Mac owner. Upon doing some research, most users have stated that yes this computer was capable of upgrading to 16gb of ram, and yes that is true. Just wanted to confirm this rumor being true and if you try this on this type of ma book pro, make sure your memory is fully seated in there. This should show up in your about this Mac as the full 16gb. Yes this makes the computer much faster of a machine than it was before when I first started this up out of box. So far this machine had met my expectations for a Mac. Being a former Linux user, I am all to familiar with the user interface. I use a iMac at work for my current system so this type of operating system is familiar to me. One thing I may suggest to future buyers of this type of machine.', make sure you do a time machine backup. Reinstalling from internet was not available to me ( tried creating a backup of the operating system on a separate disk and it had said that it was not available for download, and same went for el captain upgrade). Created a separate time machine backup on a separate drive should I ever need a copy. Case had minor scuffs in it but over I am happy with this purchase. Little nervous about some of the reviews I had read in this MacBook  and the extended recall program. So far this MacBook is working for me so I have no complaints.
Battery last about an hour. For a mac that's disgraceful. It's not a laptop because of the battery. I have to use it as a desktop so I can consytantky charge it.
I was a little worried about buying anything refurbished.  This exceeded anything I was expecting.  I LOVE IT!  Wil be looking into refurbished products again.....especially with
AMAZON.
Excellent, everything in order and in perfect condition
Extremely happy with this purchase!! Was in excellent condition for the price and had 8gb ram not 4 and 1 tb hard drive.

This machine works great and has all the power you need to run powerful programs needing a lot of ram and power.
It was not performing the way we thought it would
Just received this laptop and it is completely busted up!!!!
The charger stopped working and I haven't been able to use it. The computer was a bit broken and I think I wasted my money, sadly.
WHAT'S NOT TO LOVE ABOUT A MAC?
ok
Awesome
Works great no problems
My son said that is great
Battery died after 35 days and amazon would not honor it
Excellent working condition. Good as brand new!_
Came very fast I love this MacBook Pro
Good old Mac, still going strong at 2016, with modded 8GB ram, 256GB SSD, 1TB 2.5" HDD at CDROM Bay.
Great buy. Well worth the money.
This product does not have the correct serial numbers that match what Apple has ion file,  therefore apple cannot or will not repair it.
Buyer BEWARE, I ord
Thanks,
pretty decent so far
Great computer.
Battery lasts only 15 minutes
First experience with mac vs. pc, but no issues with the product or purchasing through Amazon.
Good person who I bought it with
Got a good price and everything works really well. Got some really nice software with it too.
My first (and probably last) laptop! The price was reasonable, i've had it for almost a month now, and it's still going strong! This was a great buy.
I bought this item used on Amazon.  There were a couple of cosmetic issues that were not specifically mention in the description.  So of the keyboard letters are a little worn.  The charger was missing a piece and that was not mentioned.

Overall, for the price and this is still a MacBook Pro model that you can still do upgrades too - I am satisfied.
Great service from seller! Shipped the same business day and arrived one day later. Great laptop at a great price, couldn't be happier. Would definitely buy again!
I love macs. Have been a macophile since the 80's. Love this size and model  because Apple has upgraded their computers to the point I won't buy the new ones. I want ports, Optical drives. Don't like new models. Prefer OS no further than Mt. Lion, too.
Sorry but thought it was a recognized MacBook pro but when taken to a dealer for special configuration, they refused to accept it.  Found out the hard way this dealer is not an sanction Apple dealer.
I love this mac. It is amazing.
Very disappointed w/it. Difficulty with trying to access sign in, and machine was loaded with other programs from the previous owner. Feel they should have been taken out.
It looks like it was never used.  So far its been a great laptop. I am adding an update The laptop was not delivered with the latest OS-X El Capitan  10.10 software and its startup was clean and smooth with the older version. To date it has been operating fine and I have been alerted to update to 10.10. I prefer to wait out major upgrades until some or all bugs have been corrected
Have had numerous bro owls with start up wifi connection screen glitches and random shut down
Worked okay for less than a year, computer shop looked at it and says the Logistics board went out, would cost more than half as much as it costs me to purchase in the first place, not going to do it.
This computer was sent with everything pre-installed including word. I really needed this for school coupled with the fact that I am a writer. I needed a good, decent computer but I didn't have thousands to spend. I am a mom with 2 jobs. Thank you so much.
This is a powerful machine. I have always been a fan of Macs but I was not a fan of the pricing. We picked this one up refurbished and it runs like new. The latest OS X "El Capitan" is really nice. This machine runs smooth and multi-tasks like nobody's business. I bought this for my fianc and she is in love. The screen quality is second to none and the battery life seems to be pretty good. I like the backlit keyboard on this model as well. It's a plus when you are in a dark room or using it at night. I am a power user so when I was running it I was running 3 or 4 applications and tabbing between them seamlessly. It has enough power to handle whatever you can throw at it. If it was mine I would probably put 8gb of ram in it and call it a day. For her, 4gb is plenty.
Overheated under a year.
was very slow. Not happy with seller
Broken version. Crashed everyday, caused me only trouble. Turns out its a defective version. Costed me a fortune in repairs. Apple didn't honor their repair for the device. Still crashes everyday, I now use it as a paperweight.
I'm very Happy
I purchased mine through the apple store when these were first released.  Within a year it stopped working.  Another year later I found out it was due to a logic board issue that Apple was aware of, but refused to fix despite a growing petition.  2 years later Apple finally started a program to fix all qualifying models with an extended warranty.  I got mine fixed, used it for about 2 months, and the computer died again.  After that I bought the  Thinkpad I'm typing this review with.  I hate this Thinkpad, but am fearful of falling for Apple hype again.  This computer will most definitely be a waste of every single cent you spend towards it.
Sell Your Mac sold this to me and when I got it in it worked fine but then I had an interesting monitor issue occur. Their customer service was on point and helped me with my problem swiftly. I will definitely be looking to by other products thru them.
Matched description, quick shipping and I'm a happy customer.
WE WERE VERY PLEASED WITH THE PRODUCT, IT IS WORKING FINE, CAME IN A SECURE BOX WELL PACKED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH
This product is very good at what it does.
Works great, great price
Everything worked great accept a USB port doesn't work
Great large laptop with performance and a nice large screen.  Considerable savings for  a 3 yr old machine in great shape.  I think I will buy used from now on.  I don't need the latest greatest.  It is more than adequate for my needs.  the 12G of memory eliminates the memory constraints from my 2009 13" macbook pro. Having the "office" software is a real + for communicating with others.
Excellent!
Only 1 large dent on the corner but they added a nice cover.  Works just as good as a brand new one at half the price!!!!
very nice, basically brand new. no scratches. great buy. worth the money.
Macbook Pro 15.4

Great for incoming college students!

I received this laptop as a high school graduation gift and took it with me to college. It has everything I need for my studies and for my personal use as well.

THE PROS:

Long-lasting battery life
 The battery lasts me throughout the day. I can take my Macbook with me to class and take notes on it without having to worry about the battery dying.

Storage and processing power
 This model comes with 120 GB of storage, which is enough to comfortably save all my files without worry of going over capacity. The processing power is also enough to run all the applications that I encounter in my courses and also to play games in my free time.

Exceptional Speakers
 The built in speakers are wonderful. Loud enough where you probably wouldnt want to play them at full volume in a public place.

Remarkable display
 The 15.4 display is large enough where I can multi-task and have multiple applications running side by side. This is helpful if you want to have a presentation open and take notes at the same time. The graphics are also fantastic and only enhance the large screen size.

Built to last
 The sleek durable design of the casing for the Macbook Pro was methodically designed to last. The aluminum finish gives the computer a tough exterior shell that is resistant to damage. It is also sleek and smooth, making it comfortable to hold and easy to slide in and out of a book bag.
THE CONS:

Cost
 The cost of the Macbook Pro is significantly higher than the price of other laptops in the market currently. Arguably though, you are paying for the Apple name and all of the features.

Not compatible with all applications
 This is not a windows computer, which causes a lot of problems when it comes to running certain applications. HOWEVER! There is a built in feature called Bootcamp that allows you to divide the hard drive into separate segments. In one of these segments Windows can be installed and ran. This allows access to all the windows applications that you were limited from before.

OVERALL:

If you are considering purchasing your first laptop and need something that has high capabilities and can fit every need, then this is the laptop for you. It has a high price tag, but you really get what you pay for with this machine. I highly recommend it!
Looks brand new. No Scratches or finder prints. Loads quickly. So far very pleased
wish I could get service on it without having to rely on WiFi, but other than that it has been working great. Just as promised!
Product came as promised - works great.
I think something is wrong with my cuz is very slow!!
The mac book was perfectly packed. The mac is as described and performs as explaind. We are satisfied with this great product.
Have had serious problems a month after purchasing this computer.  Hoping to hear back from the company to resolve this issue in my email.  Screen would fade to black, then refuse to come back on after trying a series of different troubleshoots.  Computer battery was a dud, because it would fully charge and only allow me roughly three hours of being able to work on it before having to recharge it after the first month of use.  Now the motor I think has died, because there is no noise at all coming from the motor when I hit the power button, nor will my cooling fan work when plugged into the battery (computer battery powered).  Very unsatisfied with a nine hundred dollar purchase, because my initial shutting down issues started to surface thirty days after I purchased it.
Great computer.  Everything I expected and arrived on time. Beats the heck out of my last non Apple Laptop.....
After trying to get a "remanufactured MacBook from another site FIVE times and receiving a broke POS each time I got smart and went to Amazon. First try and we got an absolutely perfect unit. Could not be more pleased with this product and the supplier.
I strongly recommend it.
High resolution, secured and other nice features.
Laptop did not work.  Sent it back for full refund.
FAST SHIPPING, LOVE IT
I received my laptop before it was promised and am very happy with it. I had a minor problem with it and the seller offered to replace it or give me back the money, but I chose to take it to a local computer repair  and it was more my inexperience than anything else.

I am completely satisfied with the computer and the seller and would recommend both very much.
Exelent product I highly recommend it.
Product delivered as advertised. Very happy with purchase.
Over all it was ok. It had a little scratch plus when I download some thing it takes for ever.
Great Macbook, I'm using it right now writing this review. No issues what so ever. The only problem I did have was when I ordered it I received a 250gb not a 500gb mac but the seller corrected this immediately. I later upgraded the macbook to 2 tb internal and 16gb ram. Great mac will buy another one as well. Well in the future of course because I own 2 currently haha.
From a dedicated PC user this is my first Mac. I love it! Opened it up out of the box and even though it's refurbished it worked perfectly.  I have other Apple products so I was able to figure it out right away. The reseller Jason was amazing to work with. Highly recommend him and his services!
Would have been nice to know someone had been inside it. But overall its fine.
The product was not has described. Was full of big scratches etc....
For the price the Macbook Pro was a very good deal. I only need to upgrade the memory and it should do everything I require of it.
I am very pleased with the service and product quality, I recommend 100%
First unit was returned; cursor moved erratically; instructions from sender did not rectify; thought to represent bad hard drive.  Second unit loaded pages very slowly.  Ultimately determined  to have a partitioned hard drive which left me with 18 MB of available memory.  Sender sent me instructions which were impossible to carry out.  I finally had to seek help from Apple; they accessed my computer remotely; took 4 hours to rectify problems.  Sender did not properly prepare computer before selling it.  Sender competency in question.
This model has defective GPU, and in my case it burns out every 2 years both in February.
What does Apple do in such case? Replaces whole logic board, which costs a lot and takes enourmous amount of time if you're live outside of USA.
Will I ever buy MBP? Definitely not.
It did not bring the programs that were in the description. (GarageBand, iMovie, etc.)
Great product! Working perfectly. Did have some dents but was noted on the description of the item.
Awesome product
Works well
perfect!
Great sell. The Macbook Pro is amazing.
The Macbook has exceed my expectations. Money well spent in my opinion! I'm a content creator for YouTube, i was in need of a budget conscious device to use as a secondary editing tool and am very pleased with the value I was able to extract on the item.
alright well to start off the computer wasn't for me, i was just the purchaser and the one who inspected the item lol.

to start off its a macbook, i am an ASUS fanboy so receiving anything that wasn't of the same type or even of same operationg system was a bit daunting. i have always disliked apple products for reasons that i will not dispose of. nonetheless the product was as ordered and of the specs that was stated. came in a very timely matter and in great condition i might add.

we ran through the battery the moment we received it charging then burning it out and we received nearly the max amount of time that u should expect from a mac battery around 5 hours or so at max brightness running videos. the screen was nice and clear and honestly nothing screamed refurbished about this computer accept normal small spots of wear on edges and on thebottom

overall very satisfied
Great!!
the macbook was just as described, as new
Great computer.
Difficult transition from old computer to this one as no information forwarded regarding passwords on the new one!!?!  Local Apple store working on final transfer.  Otherwise in excellent shape and as advertised...
i love this laptop thank you
Love it
Really very good!
Love this Mac I wanted to use it for a while before I wrote a review, and I am 100% satisfied with my purchase. I think this is the best model for upgrading!
Great computer and seller. Everything was described perfectly and the computer is exactly what I wanted. Would purchase from this seller again, when I have the need. I freely recommend this seller and their products. Thanks!
Everything fine. thanks for your promptness . Good product
Great laptop.  Came just as advertised with loads of extras.  No problems at all setting it up, and seller was very responsive with a question I had.  Highly recommend buying from him.
works great so far, arrived on time..
This Mac is amazing, its very well taken care of, it has no problems at all. It's super fast and has a ton of software on it, very happy i bought this computer. AMAZING
This is awesome.  I upgraded the RAM and popped a SSD in and this thing SCREAMS!  I think there is a lot of value in buying this one vs the new pro models.  The ability to upgrade a device is important to me.
At first I was skeptical about buying this laptop since its used.. but its actually really good  came in an Apple box looks and works great!
Had a great experience with this purchase.
Shipped 2-3 days late even though I paid for 1 day shipping. After a week or so of using it the logic board burned up and the hard-drive is very old and nearly dead. Ended up getting a different laptop, trying to sell the one I got for parts.
I received my MacBook Pro within the delivery time and I am very pleased with the condition and functionality of the machine. It is fast and has all the resources needed for the tasks. Well done.
Just so you can have an idea of my computer knowledge, I work in the IT industry and have been for 25 years.  I used to use and sell Apple products and was a big fan of how easy they were to use and get support for.  Then, due to employers preferences, I was given Windows PC's and used them until Oct. 2012 when starting a new job and I was given a MacBook Air 13".  This summer (June 2014) I purchased a used 2011 MacBook Pro 15" with 500GB HD, 8GB RAM, i7 Intel processor.  My review of this MacBook Pro comes after a few months of use, conversation with other Mac users, searching online for support of issues I've been having.  In short, I now wish I hadn't bought this MacBook.  In my opinion, PC's have been made easier to use than the MacOS allows.  I realize this is an opinion and will describe the issues I've had.  Also, I realize that long time Mac people will have knowledge that I don't so my review may be more relevant to others like me, who are thinking of moving from a PC to a Mac.

Some issues we had at my company with Mac's compatibility with Windows based applications made me hesitant to buy this MacBook Pro but I wanted to have more capability to do HD movie editing and friends and business associates unanimously told me that the Mac is the way to go.  I'm no pro at movie editing by any means and am only using iMovie which I had to buy though it usually is included on Macs when you buy them new.  My first impression is of how well the hardware looks and seems very sturdy in it's construction.  It's solid on that front, probably better than any others on the market aside from ruggedized portable computers.  My MBP came with Microsoft Outlook included which was a requirement I had.  I don't use this Mac for my job, but I hate web based mail because of the many limitations in comparison to a native (local) inbox residing on my computer.  The first thing I found out after setting up Outlook for my Email is that many features that I used at least hourly on a WinPC are just not available on the Mac version.  The next thing I found was that even after what, 20 years of Outlook for Mac being on the market, there are still major issues with the program running on the Mac.  It constantly loses connection and can't reconnect to the MSN server.  It's not an issue with my router or anything else, it's solely the Mac and Outlook.  I make a point of this because in my research I've found that tons of people are having the same issues and neither Microsoft nor Apple are interested in dealing with them.  It's very, very frustrating.

Google Chrome: I have never liked Apple's Safari browser.  To me it seems an infant in a land of professionals, but again that's my opinion.  Internet Explorer isn't perfect, and it's definitely the target of every hacker on the planet, but it has features and compatibility that apparently Safari will never achieve.  I have been using Chrome for a few years almost exclusively, except when a web site isn't compatible and until recently had no problems with Chrome.  On the MacOS (I have Mavericks) Chrome "works" but there are issues immediately.  On my Mac, every single time I click to open Chrome, I get a warning message that has to be clicked away before Chrome will start.  The message is warning about programs downloaded from the internet.  The only fix I've found for this requires command line programming and risk of a mistake could cause further issues.  This is for an extremely common application that has been around for years and years.  Again, neither Google nor Apple seem to care enough to want to deal with this issue.

Performance: This is one area where I feel this Mac does well.  I won't say it's "better" than a PC of the same specs, but it's not worse either.  Mac's do manage RAM (memory) better than PC's in my opinion.  On a WinPC, 8GB of RAM running Win7 is the minimum you should have.  Any less, and you won't be able to run much of anything other than the OS.  On my Mac, I think 4GB probably would have handled 99% of what I do but with 8GB I never even get close to hitting the limit even with 12 Chrome tabs open, MS Word and Excel running as well as iMessage, iMovie and iTunes.  This is a huge "positive" to me.  I would likely need 12-16GB of RAM on a Win8 PC.  I have very limited experience with Win8 but I hated it to be perfectly frank.

I wish I had gone with a 13" version of this computer.  The 15" is very heavy in my opinion.  I certainly don't want to travel with it.  The MacBook Air was great for travel though.

The MacOS used to be very intuitive, with easy to figure out and use features.  That was quite a few years ago but I expected it to only be even easier to figure out by now.  That is not the case.  To my surprise, many simple tasks that I took for granted on my WinPC are a royal pain and require at least twice as many steps to accomplish.  This applies to file management, save, locate & open, attachments, etc.  Just simple things that were "one click" in Win7 are multiple steps without obvious means of accomplishing them.  Any attempt to obtain help for the issues I've had has resulted in my being channeled to Apple's online support "community".  My experience there has been dismal.  If you're not a die-hard Apple fanatic, you get condescension, ridicule, and elitist attitudes.  Interacting with an actual Apple employee seems to be impossible unless you pay more money.  This was the case with my iPhone which I bought new, so I already knew what to expect there.  Even under the iPhones pathetic 90 day warranty, I was treated like I was yesterday's trash.  I've been to the local Apple store's Genius Bar.  When I finally got to see the actual guy who was going to address the issue I was having, he was polite, knowledgeable and quickly identified the cause and fixed that issue.  However, that was after I got passed the initial contact person at the front of the store which made my blood boil.  She asked what I needed, I told her that I was having issues with my device and needed support.  She proceeds to sell me another one of the same thing I showed her!  This is Apple Culture and I feel it is relevant to anybody considering buying an Apple product for the first time.

I like the configuration of this MacBook Pro though 2 USB ports seems insufficient.  I will probably never use the FireWire port so that is wasted on me at least.  I've always liked the magnetic charging AC connector.  Very, very cool.  No friction and it just seems to work flawlessly.  I don't have the Retina Display but have seen those on others and I just don't see the need for that expense for my purposes.  The anti-glare screen on my MBP is great.  Very low reflection makes it easier to read in more light conditions.  The Wi-Fi seems to work great.  Even when Outlook loses it's connection constantly, my browser always is connected and when waking from sleep mode, the Wi-Fi fires up quickly and connects.  I don't use iCloud so I have no comments regarding that on this Mac.

iMovie is a decent low end video editor.  I find the "Help" feature on every Apple product I own to be virtually useless, and the iMovie Help perpetuates that opinion for me.  I found much better help in using iMovie on YouTube than anything Apple provides.  When I enter search terms in Apple's "Help" field, it almost never returns relevant results.  I don't know if I speak the wrong language or what the issue is, but their Help feature is just a waste of space to me.  Still, after viewing some YouTube videos, I was quickly able to create movies with my HD video clips that were fun to make and share with friends & family.

Summary: For the fun stuff like creating movies, viewing pictures, playing music, etc, this MacBook Pro has been good.  It is meeting expectations on those items.  For business and productivity applications, I'm sorry to say the Mac is still light years behind Windows PC's comparably equipped.  And PC's are still lower priced than Mac's, and there is still a lot more productivity software for PC's than for the Mac.  Those that are available on both platforms have significantly less features in the Mac version than are commonly used on PC versions.  Support is just pathetic in my opinion.  To me, it feels like Apple just doesn't want to hear any negativity about their products.  That may explain their silent treatment when ever anything negative makes the news.  I am trying to move from an 8 year old HP PC to this Mac, and it has been a very painful process.  When I needed support for my HP PC, I was stunned how fast I had a live person on the phone who was based in the U.S. and English was their first language.  Support calls were efficient, concise, friendly and SUPPORTIVE.  My experience with Apple's support has been ineffective, condescending, used car salesman like, and on one occasion the Apple support person caused another issue for which he was unwilling to resolve.  Fashion appears to be one of the top selling points of Apple products.  I like cool looking products as much as anyone, but my first requirement is productivity when it comes to a computer.  In that regard, I've been greatly underwhelmed by this MacBook Pro.  Getting things done inevitably requires me to get support or education to use this thing, both of which are costly and aggravating to obtain.  On my PC, that seemed pretty easy to obtain and get going on what I needed to accomplish.  Because of this factor, I don't feel this is a good product for me.  Anyone have an i7 laptop PC you'd like to trade??
when it came first it was not turning on at all i had to pay someone to have it sorted out
Truly awesome!! Just like new!
The Mac is really good. the Only concern that I have is the up button, the packaging was not sturdy enough for shipping, but Thankfully the mac was safe and sound.
Best computer I have ever had. Now that I have a Mac, I won't go back.
Despite the fact that this laptop was used, it's as good as new for a great price.
Exactly as advertised. Looks and works like new. I am so happy. I am off to do techy things now.
If you're thinking of buying a used early 2011 Macbook Pro, don't do it. It has a design fault that causes a catastrophic logic board failure, requiring a replacement of the whole logic board. I've had it replaced twice - in a computer that's only 3 years old. Fortunately, it was under AppleCare, but if it wasn't, I would have been out about $600.

Unfortunately, Apple refuses to acknowledge the fault, despite an almost 500 page thread on their forums with owners detailing the problems they've had.

I'm not anti-Apple. Our family has 4 MacBook Pros of various ages, plus a couple of iPads and I've used Macs since the late 1980s. However, Apple's refusal to acknowledge this design fault is highly disappointing.

2015-02-19 Apple has just launched an extended-warranty program for these computers, where they'll repair any of them with the logic board failure I describe above. See http://www.apple.com/support/macbookpro-videoissues/
The item came and was in good shape, but that was lucky happenstance as the packaging was very inferior.  It was wapped in one sheet of bubblewrap and one corner was torn open.  I took to to the Applestore to have it checked out.  As it happens, everything was in good shape, but I was holding my breath.  Thanks for asking.
Oh man how can I begin to tell you, LOVE IT, my son hasn't put it down since Friday it's fast and the condition of it was excellent couldn't believe it was used.
This thing gets really hot (around 80C) playing movies and games. Now, this is limited to pure work - not a good choice for all around computing.
Thank you for working with me to resolve the issue with warranty for this computer. I cannot wait for it to arrive and my son sees it. Im sure he will be very happy and satisfied with the quality and condition of this computer.  I cannot tell you how refreshing it is to have a Seller that responds to every question with care, professionalism, understanding, and a will to put the customer first. I congratulate you on having employee like Jason that represents your company in that way.
When I ready to buy another computer you can bet you last dollar there will not be a question on which company I have the FAITH in
I got this computer within 4 days of ordering and upon arrival with a full charge it was ready to go just as if i had bought it new.
Great laptop, so glad I switched over to the Mac OS. I need to buy more RAM for the laptop, but it's very powerful as a processor.
I have upgraded the RAM to 8GB (maxed out), replaced hard drive with 256GB SSD right after I received this from amazon.  Added boot camp with windows 8 OS and that boots up fast as well.

Screen is bright and clear.  Sometimes the fan make noise when I play games or running video/photo editor which is normal as the video card heats up when using heavy graphics program.

Keyboard is soft and very comfortable.  Trackpad is very useful as there's an ability to zoom in/out.
Keyboard just doesn't last... rest is great. Made in China is still made in china. Buy cheaper and take the apple sticker off the car
Over a year if daily use and still going strong.  Cannot wait to upgrade the RAM soon to 16GB.  Love APPLE
i paid top dollar for this computer and they scammed me.  sold me a single core processor for the price of a quad-core processor.  I want my money back.
Two years later and it's still going strong. This was my first computer on transition from Windows. A great computer! Apple really knows how to make them.
The charger has never once broke on me, after numerous times of it getting tugged on. It has actually saved my computer's life. It's held onto the computer magnetically so it easily disconnects if need be.
I've dropped this computer a few times myself and other times it has fallen on my sons tantrum. It has survived. Not a scratch or dent.
Just don't go throwing it now!
After my pleasant experience using this computer, I'm going to be upgrading to a newer model, probably even an iMac.
Make sure to keep it on a flat surface. The bottom of it gets very hot after long use.
right out of the box the wireless card did not work. I called the company telling them it was bad, and they agreed to have the computer shipped back to them to fix. before i could get it back to them, it stopped working completely. I had to go out and buy a brand new macbook pro from the store to finish the project i was working on.
I ordered this unit used through the Amazon Marketplace.  I needed a Macbook Pro with a built in optical drive due to the nature of of my work so I didn't want to get the latest model of the Macbook Pro.  Although this review is not for the seller, I will just say that this laptop was in pristine condition and everyone that I have shown it to says that it looks brand new.

That said, the Quad Core i7 in this machine is perfect.  The only thing i did is upgrade the RAM.  It is very fast for all tasks and I do a lot of media heavy (i.e. - audio and video editing) things that require a lot.  Is it a Mac Pro?  Certainly not, but by necessity I do much of my work on the go and a desktop is out of the question most of the time.

Even though this machine is a couple years old it has more than enough horsepower for 99.9% of standard computer users and even though for power users.  If you want the latest/greatest like Retina display, thinner, lighter, then this isn't for you, but if you want an laptop with a built in optical drive that still delivers on the power side, this Macbook Pro definitely delivers.  I got my unit for just over $1000 which I felt was a great deal, especially given the perfect condition.  It's a good deal if you don't want to pay full price for a powerful computer.
The computer was as described and in better condition than I thought. Thank You for a great product and a smooth transaction.
Very satisfied with this powerful computer and stillI feel I got an awesome price for it.

Definitely recommended to anyone who wants power/price efficiency.
I have not put it to extreme yet but for my day to day work it works very well.
May be later on i will put extra RAM if need be.
Aside from *HATING* iTunes 11 (You can hide the update and not make the move until they fix it). There are a few minor annoyances (Death of Rosetta, 4-finger swipe up now does the expose pick-a-window thing instead of showing the desktop, finder sidebar sort change and gray icons, and the inverted scroll behavior chief among them) going from 10.6 to 10.7\10.8, but overall we're delighted with it.
It's used, so it can't be perfect as a new one, but considering the price of a used one and a new one, I chose the used one.
This is the first mac I owe, but i simply love it. I've already have it for more than a year and a half, but did not have any problems with it. Moreover, I was able to extend its memory from 4GB to 8GB easily by myself at home.
This was my first macbook and I absolutely love it.  It's sleek and light.  The battery life is fantastic.  I would buy several more like it for my friends if I could afford to!
I look forward to purchasing more products similar to this one.  I am even interested in a desk top.
Computer did not survive one day with my 12 year old daughter without needing $700 in repairs.  Design has some basic durability faults.  Key board is wide open to liquids, dust, contaminates which could quickly destroy it.  Plastic keyboard covers could cause overheating.
Beat or exceeded my expectations. Love how easy it is to use and program. I am a confirmed Apple user
This is one of the best laptops on the market.  The old canard that it's more expensive than equivalent Windows laptops just isn't true.  You have to dig into the specs of this thing to really make a comparison.  But that's irrelevant, let's talk about the laptop itself.

The good

* Very nice graphics.  When plugged in you get nice HD video from an AMD 6490M (when you're plugged in) or from an Intel 3000HD when on battery.
* Multi touch (well almost) trackpad.  It's missing a couple of things from the huge Magic Trackpad from Apple, but it has everything I can use.  I can really maneuver around the computer with my trackpad.
* Brilliant screen, 1440X900, absolutely HD.
* OSX 10.7 Lion.  Really the best OSX by far, and amazing what it can do.
* Speedy quad-core i7 processor.  My massive Excel spreadsheets recalc fast.  And working with Photoshop and Aperture show no issues whatsoever.  This laptop really can be considered a mobile desktop.
* Beautiful aluminum case.  Just makes it feel expensive.  (One note, aluminum does bend easily, so if you're rough with your computer, get one of those protective skins.)
* Nice built-in camera for video chatting, Skype or other things.
* Easy to upgrade to 8GB memory.  And you can get it for a lot less than Apple charges.

Not so good

* I'm not a big fan of the speakers.  They don't put out very much sound, even at full blast.  It's kind of hard to watch movies without a headset.
* The hard drive is light for the price.  Amazon sells 1TB 2.5" hard drives for a good price, but upgrading the hard drive takes some skill to do it right.

Overall, I am very happy with the laptop.  I use it for everything from basic web browsing to photo editing to business work.  I have had a lot of MacBooks, so I guess I'm not only used to them, I know how to get the most of them.  This one is a great one.
The MacBook pro is a very good investment.  A fast computer and very intuitive.  Your service is very good as well.  Thanks.
I purchased the top o' the line Macbook Pro 15" (with extra memory, 2.5 GHz, and the high-rez / no-glare screen option).
It's, of course, a great machine. I knocked a star off my review because of the battery life and the (I assume necessary) fan sound. My MBP from a couple of years ago didn't have an audible fan noise, and the fan never kicked into "high gear" like this one does on occasion. It's a more powerful machine, so I guess this comes with the territory. This increased power also seems to have shortened the duration of a battery charge. Don't fall for the "up to seven hours". I get MAYBE half that. Yes, I'm a power user, but even with simple tasks (and the screen at about 40%), the battery still drains faster than my old unit. It's a brilliant device, so these aspects are annoyances that I can live with. Oh, I am also disappointed that the 15" MBP doesn't have USB 3. It's got USB 2 and firewire. Of course it has Thunderbolt, but that's not yet embraced by very many third party devices. I picked up an external back-up drive with firewire, but it was a bummer to shop and see all the drives with USB 3. Apparently only the 17" MBP has USB 3. BTW, I much prefer the no-glare screen.
Apple MacBook Pro MC721LL/A 15.4" LED Notebook - Core i7 i7-2635QM 2 GHz is as good a notebook computer as one could asked for.  It is well constructed, highly functional, and require less fuss for all its functions.
It's quite disappointing that the black pack which carries the manuals, cleaning cloth and the MacOS DVD's doesn't have the DVD's in it on my new Macbook Pro purchased :(

Amazon, please send me the original DVD's ASAP
I will post a more extensive review after I have owned the product for a longer time.

Right now I can say I am very impressed with the product, and am happy with my purchase. For those of you interested in the newst version of this product, it is almost the same, except with somewhat improves speed and graphics. If you are worried about owning the latest and greatest, or just want that extra speed, go to that product page. Otherwise, I think that it is worth it to save an extra 200 bucks. Thats a mic, pop filter, stand, and proffesional headphones! I don't really want to pay 200 bucks just for the sake of it.

Anyway, real review is coming. Until then....
Good solid laptop. My review is just a FYI to say newer 15" laptops may be coming out in Nov with 10% increase in CPU speed and graphics chip.

I have to see about returning mine...just got it last week.  Great product, but bad timing for me.
It's wonderful!!!  Bought it for my son for college.  He LOVES IT!!!!  Shipping was fast and with no hassles.  Great price.  With 2 kids in college gotta love that!!!!!
The 15" MacBook Pro I recently purchased is awesome!  I've always been a Mac user, but I was plesantly surprised when I opened the box.  It has so many features and very user friendly.  I would highly recommend this computer and really glad I decided to get it; another great Steve Jobs product!
This is a great laptop!, Came with all the things it promised and is pretty slick. At first it was hard to use for me since Im a recent Mac convert but it has won over me! Make sure to buy a cover for it though because the fragile aluminum cover can get scratches easily.
The shipping was super fast, i paid for two day shipping, but i got it a day earlier than expected. also there was a lot of care taken when packaging the macbook pro into the box that the macbook pro was in. Very reliable computer, amazing graphics, kickass processor and everything else. i couldn't ask for anything better, well besides more ram but thats less than a hundred dollars and maybe a half hour of my time, much cheaper than paying 400 dollars more for it to come right from apple. All around amazing laptop. no complaints thus far. :)
Let me start by saying that I've been using PCs my whole life and I am now 17.  I decided to buy a Macbook Pro for college because I am going two years before I would have actually gone to college.  I was torn between the 15 inch and 13 inch.  I decided on the 15 inch because I do a lot of programming, mostly for fun, but I'm also on a robotics team, because I'm a Physics major.  I decided on the 15 inch model and I'm very happy that I did.  The screen size is perfect for extended periods of use while programming.  The free software on the Mac store called xCode is a great application.

I've used PCs all of my life and the Mac OS is head over heels better than all of the Windows OS versions.  Although, Windows 7 is a much closer competitor.

Parallels Desktop 7 allows you to run Windows 7 on your Mac also, this adds the best of both worlds.  Mac's killer OS and Windows' programs.

Pros:
Multitasking is AMAZING ON THE MAC!!!  I love it, Mac OS Lion is great in the ways of multitasking.
It is extremely fast.
The screen size is perfect.
The Mac App Store is great.
The keypad is backlit.
Trackpad has amazing sensitivity.
The battery life is good.

Cons:
It gets a bit hot on the bottom if it doesn't get proper ventilation.
Glossy screen, but for me it isn't that bad.

The fact that there is an App Store creates so many possibilities for the future of the Mac.  It also adds so many things you can do in the way of note taking, applications that help you brainstorm for writing papers.  It has been a big help with my 5 page essays. I would definitely recommend this for anybody who likes to program because the screen size is perfect for extended periods of use.  This is a great computer.  It would be even better if you have an iPad or iPhone.  If you have either of those than I would strongly suggest you get a Macbook because of the application compatibility.  This is a great computer and the pros heavily outweigh the cons.  The heat only happens if you have it suffocated by your lap.  This is a great computer and you should definitely get it for college, or any other work related things.
I got the glossy model, base configuration and will upgrade through third parties.  Very satisfied so far.  Feels like the sturdiest, best designed laptop I've ever owned.

My only complaint is that as of today (09/19/2011), Amazon's product description states that "This Mac comes pre-installed with OS X Snow Leopard, but you can order a free upgrade to OS X Lion..."  In fact, it ships with Lion pre-installed.  Dozens (if not hundreds) of major 3rd party applications have yet to announce compatibility with Lion, so this can be a significant issue for quite some time.  Amazon is not "set up" to do something as simple as send a customer an OS install disc to fix a problem clearly caused by their own product data.

Long story short, I did call Apple and, as it's still under warranty, they dropped a Snow Leopard disk in the mail and will be here in 2-3 days.

I requested that Amazon change the product description, so I'll update this review as soon as it's published.
This computer is excellent, i will be an apple fan a little bit longer, no more slow startups and blue screens. I really recommend this product.
It's already Lion install in it, like it much! But I think 4G memory is a little bit small for Xcode. When I compile an OGRE project, it will run out of memory sometimes.
I have used Windows since Windows ME and I have never tried a Mac. The closest I got to a Mac was in school and I thought they were terrible.
Back to 2011, I felt the need to buy a new laptop to replace my existing Windows 7 laptop (i wanted a sandy bridge and faster laptop). I was hesitant at first because of the ridiculous pricing but this macbook pro changed my mind entirely of my perception of macs.

The laptop finishes booting up a few seconds quicker than my Acer laptop and the user interface was beautiful in its simplicity. This is the key word here folks: simplicity. Windows involve more menu clicking and finding compared to a Mac. Dont get me started on the screen, WOW! My eyes WILL get used to this when studying. In fact, it will make studying easier because the screen doesnt have dull areas like on my acer. Now the trackpad, it is the best trackpad I have used. You can move on the trackpad and click simultaneously without letting go of your finger. I like the chiclet keys plus the backlighting LED makes it look cool. The side speakers have incredible volume that I actually have to LOWER the volume because it was just too loud! My acer's volume fail in comparison but Acer's laptop have a smaller speaker.

Overall:
Apple Macbook Pro design is sophisticated, clean, and functional. I feel like a heavy burden has left my shoulder thanks to the nice trackpad, screen resolution and quality, and overall ease of use of Mac's OS X Lion.

Apple has converted me from PC's! (Well, for now anyway!)
It has been several years since I worked with a Mac, but I love how fast it starts up. It is easy to navigate the applications. I'm still learning things about it but I love it so far.
I Took quite a while to decide on whether to buy this laptop. I was also considering the 13" MacBook Pro and the Dell XPS15z. All of them are worthy laptops. I was attracted to the XPS as it is very well priced and a great looking laptop. But in the end I stuck with Mac. I have been a Mac user since about 2002. So, all my private software etc is Mac. Switching back to Windows would have been a struggle as much of the software is not available on Windows and if it is, the look and feel and functionality is a step down from Mac. So then had to decide on whether I go for the 13" or not. I have always had the 13" models. In the end I went for the 15" because the sound is better and the sheer power of the laptop is brilliant. So much so that since getting this laptop I have retired my iMac i3, my son was very happy to inherit!

In short then, you won't go wrong with this. It is beautiful, powerful, portable and the OS and applications are brilliant.
I recently upgraded my four year old MacBook Pro for this one and I couldn't be happier with my decision. It was difficult to spend the $1700 but in the end well worth it. PC's do not compare to Mac's, especially when you work in a created environment. If you are having hesitation like I did, don't worry you will be more then satisfied with this product.
Nice to have LION pre-Installed, also the Keyboard comes updated with launchpad and mission control FN Keys.

Best Ever computer I have purchased.
fantastic laptop. definitely very expensive but you're getting a high quality product. i wish they got rid of the optical drive and put in a 2nd hd. optical media is dying and i never need it.

if you're going to buy this, you must get the high res & anti-glare for $150 extra. it's definitely worth the money
I have owned my new Macbook Pro for two months now.. I always had Dell  (four of them)  I find the Mac faster and it has much clearer grahics and lots of features which I am still learning.. I am very pleased with the purchase and recommend it if you can afford the extra money.
NOTE: This MBP comes with OS Lion pre-installed, not the OS Snow Leopard as described on the product page.  I purchased it on Friday 8/19/11 and received it next day.  I guess Amazon has not updated the description of the laptop yet.  I have no complaints about the software version as I wanted OS Lion anyway.  However, I do think that Amazon should correct this since there may be some customers that are specifically looking for the older OS.

Otherwise, it's a great laptop as everyone else has described in great detail, so no need for me to repeat them.  I had purchased the latest MBA 11" when it first came out a few weeks ago, but I ended up returning it.  I had no problems with MBA 11" either, but I did find that the font size were too small for my old eyes!  MBA 13" and MBP 13" seemed to be ackward size for me since they are not as portable as MBA 11", and too small to be a everyday computer.  MBA 17" was too big for a laptop and extremely expensive.  So, I setteld on MBP 15" which seems to have the right combination of size, performance, and price (relative to other Macs).  I only give it a 4 star because I still think it's very expensive relative to PC laptops.  Therefore, for people that are on a tighter budget, it may not be suitable.  But, if you can afford it, I highly recommend any of the Macs.
I said it, and i mean it. Pulling this laptop out of the box is probably like opening a treasure chest found underneath a thousand feet of ocean. It feel like pure gold. The weight and density are all proportional, it opens and closes perfectly, the screen is the most beautiful computer screen you'll see at a price that isn't outrageous. Even the charger(yes the freaking charger) looks and feels solid while remaining nimble enough to pop-out the moment you miss-step and pull. I love it and i'm thinking about marrying it.

small gripe(nobody is perfect): Annoying that they just released Lion OSX but it doesn't come installed. So you get the laptop and have to pay $30 more to have it fully upgraded. WTF?
***EDIT*** Someone that commented on this review says Apple is upgrading Lion OS for free!!!
I TAKE BACK MY SMALL GRIPE, THIS LAPTOP IS PERFECT
I bought this because it was supposed to include a free upgrade to OS-X Lion.  But when I try to download Lion it doesn't recognize my computer's serial number, and when I try the alternate route of sending apple a copy of my on line receipt they won't accept that as proof of purchase.

What a rip off!

I am sending my computer back.

Do NOT buy a new apple computer for a month or two until Lion comes pre-installed.
Let me start off by saying I have always been a pc guy until I purchased my 2010 macbook pro 13' last year and I must say I don't know why I waited so long! I purchased my 13 back in September and about 6 months later I saw the new MacBook pros came out and comparing the specs I felt like I needed to upgrade. I replaced my 2010 Macbook Pro 13 with this and I must say that I am very pleased. The dual core on the 2010 seemed fast but when compared to the i7 quad core the dual core isn't even in the same universe! The 15' is super fast and great at handling multiple apps at once. The new Lion OSX is excellent and apple has added  a lot of things to make this os superb to others. The only drawback is that Apple has axed rosetta which means power pc run applications and games are no longer supported. However I like the fact that if needed you can add windows via bootcamp (if you want to play pc games or need to use apps that are not compatible with macs). The battery life on this laptop is great. I can usually get 6 to 8 hours of life from a single charge depending on what I am doing. Most laptops can only get 3 or 4 max. The battery can actually be calibrated to help get the most out of a charge. Ilife 11 is a great addition with this laptop and apps like iMovie and iPhoto couldn't be easier to use. Portability isn't as good as the 13' but with this computer being pretty much 2x-3x faster that the 2010 13' I'm not complaining. Overall I am extremely pleased with my purchase and if your thinking about converting to a Mac, DO IT! You will be very satisfied.

PROS
1. The processor is a super fast 2.0 ghz quad core i7 great for gaming on bootcamp or on lion (2x-3x faster than previous generations).
2. The battery life is great. ( A little less than my 2010 13' mbp but it averages about 6 to 8 hours a charge depending on what I'm doing so I'm not complaining)
3. Osx Lion is a great upgrade from snow leopard and does a great job at keeping everything organized and fast.
4. Great apps included like Garageband and iPhoto.
5. The case looks very sleek, thin, and professional and the backlit keyboard can be super bright or dim depending on how you want it.
6. Bootcamp is a great feature that many people may not know used to run windows on your mac if needed.
 7. The screen is extremely bright and big and hd videos look crisp and clear.

CONS
1. Price is a little steep compared to other pc's with the same specs.
2. When running windows the laptop can get very warm.
3. In the new Lion OSX power pc run apps and games is not supported anymore.
I upgraded from the regular white MacBook to this laptop back in March. I've had my old MacBook for about 3 years and did a lot of video, photo and other digital media on it. When I purchased this computer and saw that my rendering time for videos was being cut down by DAYS I couldn't believe that I ever edited on my old MacBook. The graphics and visuals are absolutely breathtaking, the light up keyboard is really nice, the overall craftsmanship of this computer is beautiful and such a step up from the regular macbook. I've had this computer for about half a year now and it looks like it did when i first took it out of the box without any maintenance whatsoever. After seeing what the MacBook Pro is capable of, I will never go back to any lower model or different brand. I recommend this computer for anyone and everyone, but especially those who work with HD video and other digital media. It is truly an amazingly fast, smooth, and beautiful machine.
First off I love my Macbook because it provides more stability than my windows machines. For professional work it can't be beat as of this moment. Although it is more stable than my windows machines it still freezes, on average, twice a month. So it is not invincible like some fanboys would want you to believe.

Let me get to why I gave it a 2 out of 5 stars. WPA/WPA2 support is finnicky AT BEST. DUAL MONITOR support is wonky, unreliable and ultimately useless. Not addressing WPA issues is just ridiculous considering that it is something that can be fixed easily and why tout a miniport display that performs so poorly?

Everything else seems to work pretty well. I hope to update this review as soon as these problems are resolved.

Update: Maybe the WPA2 problems are only with certain routers as it doesn't have problems with our new Asus router.
Within nine months the power adapter went to crap. Since it was within the 1 year warranty, Apple replaced it for free (it would have cost me $65 plus tax). I'm on my second external monitor cable and it is also giving problems now.

Update: About a month ago (2 & 1/2 years after purchase date) The monitor started glitching on me and now I experience the Blue Screen of Death every time I turn it on. Unfortunately, I don't have money to get it fixed right now. I am very disappointed that I'm experiencing these problems after paying such a high premium for this laptop. As far as Apple Care goes, I don't think it's right to pay so much extra for peace of mind when this expensive machine should be durable.

Update: The monitor problem is still here and I've decided NOT to buy a Macbook ever again! After paying over $2K for something that only lasted 2 1/2 years, I'm not willing to take that risk again. STOP VOTING ME DOWN! I've had a horrible experience and I'm just sharing my experience so others can make a better buying decision by taking my experience into account.
the only one thing that I really like was that when I took the laptop out side it was easy to read,now as a PC guy always wanted an apple my skills in a mac are near to none but the apple company tech support was not to helpful at all,some were not to friendley  and also hope you need tech support before 6 pm eastern time becuase they close at 6 pm,also it became very hard to play games when u need to right click a guy at the game room told me to used the arrows ( yeah sure) also some programs were not compatible or really difficult to down load well as for me I sold this apple and went back to my PC witch was more cheaper with a lot better power under the hood.
I got this MacBook Pro a few weeks ago and I love it. The keyboard and screen are nice, and so is the aluminum body. It is very prone to scratches and dents, though. It is very fast and I love the preloaded software. I also like not having to install and update antivirus every week like on my PC. There are no random reboots or freezes like on my PC either, but, I did notice that the bottom is kind of hollow, and it creaks, which is unaccaptable for a $2,500 computer. It is a very nice and clean OS, but all the silver and gray feels cold. Other than those small issues, it is a great laptop.
In May my dad bought me a Mac Book Pro for my birthday. I was a little wary at first never having really used a Mac before, but today I can easily say that I'm happy with it. I'm not particularly computer savvy (and I won't pretend otherwise) so the computer is more than likely capable of far more than I use it for, but it does everything I want very well. Perhaps my favorite thing is the quick start up time, from turning my computer on it literally takes less than half a minute to get full speed. My only real complaint or observation is that the area just above the keyboard can get very hot with extended use. Great laptop.
I just Received The 15' Mac Book Pro which was nicely expedited over the next day. The Condition of the Mac was Fair with some scratches here and there, also bumps. Macs Make great Hardware so the dings outside the Mac were ignore-able after it compensated by all the nice expensive software inside... Like Microsoft Word for Mac, Adobe Acrobat PRO which is neat... and will enjoy the Mac Until I upgrade with a Next Gen Mac Book Pro over-all I like it.
I am so impressed with Apple's designs.  Every detail is extraordinary.  I and my college son recipient are delighted with the MacBook Pro and even the details of the packaging.

Amazon processed quickly and UPS delivered next day.
I have been using Macbook Pro for the past 2 years (though it was an official one). When I used to compare it with my personal windows laptop, actually I could not compare...there was nothing to compare. Macbook was light years ahead of it. Another plus was that with Mac OSX, you can surf the web without worrying the intrusion of spywares and viruses in your machine, effectively eliminating the need for an anti virus. All these factors were compelling enough for me to shell out 1700$ to make it mine.

I have now upgraded to LION OS and oh boyyy...using it is like biting through a cheesecake...smooth! I also do a lot of photography and developing pics is just an out of the world experience on Mac. The screen is so vibrant that the pics almost speak out. I have a glossy screen and since I mostly use it indoors, I got no issues. In fact I love it more than the anti-glare one.

Coming to the performance, well this is supposed to the most advanced laptop in the market and it truly lives up to its name. The booting (after installing LION) is around 30-40 seconds! The clicks are so responsive that I have forgotten what latency is, the speakers are a nice addition and it even has a slot for SDHC cards...I can just takes pics and insert the memory card directly into this slot and boom...its done. Goodbye USB cables, now I don't need to depend on you. Lastly the batter life is amazing, it gives me around 6 hrs on normal work and around 5-5.5 hours with wi-fi on.

All in all, thumbs up for Macbook Pro and also to Amazon for letting me have a 100$ waiver.
Great Product..
Very fast delivery through Amazon.
Reasonable price compared to other sellers.

The product has the most best configuration for this budget,uncomparable performance.

Made for each other to Techies and Artists
This is the first Mac that I have owned.  I also own an iPhone 4 and an iPad (first generation).  I love this product.  Two days ago, I updated to Lion, free of charge, since I bought this MacBook Pro from Amazon after June 6, 2011.  It is great for surfing the web, work, watching movies, everything!  I am an attorney, and formatting of Word documents is critically important to me.  I installed Mac Office 2011 on my MacBook Pro.  It works fabulously.  No formatting errors with my PC friends at work when working on Word docs on my Mac.  Buy this Mac, you won't go back!
I LOVE this MacBook Pro !, after having nothing prior but PC's this was a big step to take. I figured that since I already own an iPhone4 and several iPods my learning curve wasn't going to be insurmountable.
Since this purchase I haven't touched or missed my old PC with Microsoft's CONSTANT and annoying security updates.
I'll NEVER go back to a PC, in fact I'm currently trying to decide which iMac that I want for a desktop
Pickded this up from a 3rd party seller for $1500 (had less than 10 battery cycles, pristine and obviously $700 less than retail when new).  This is a multitasking beast!  Run VMware Fusion 3 (a resource hog with Win 7) while I surf with safari or edit pictures with final cut 3 with no noticeable loss in performance.  Now I did add the max 8GB ram, and boot up is in like 30 seconds and ready ( even with the stock 5400 rpm HD); truly the most powerful computer I've owned.  Bet it will even with better with Lion.  Highly recommended.
My daughter is leaving for college.  From what I understand from talking to her, most universities have a large open pit in which they stone the students who arrive for their freshman year with PCs.  It's all about cool and image.  The price on Macs is incredibly steep, about three times what a really good laptop PC would cost.  While I have yet to see what that extra thousand bucks gets you, it did buy me freedom from at LEAST a year of griping and foul moods from my daughter.  Buy a Mac, be unique, just like everybody else.
This is my fourth 15" MacBook Pro in 10 years.  I buy the same model every time, new and improved.  This is the first one I have some qualms about.

1) Glossy screen stinks.  Too much glare.  Glossy screens are for casual users, not professionals.

2) I need to buy a dongle to hook this up to an external screen.  That's ridiculous.  A dongle, what is this 1988?

3) One day the battery will conk out and because of Steve Jobs' neurotic tick about external batteries, I'll have to shell out 250 bucks or so to get a new one. Harrumph!

4) Other than that, the machine is fast, slick and wonderful, a significant improvement over the one I bought three years ago.
Its everything I expected plus some! I always wanted to make the switch to mac from pc, but never had the funds. This year I will be attending college so it was mandatory to buy a laptop. I did some research and it was final I was getting a Macbook Pro. I thought about buying the higher end model (2.2, 6750m) , but I will not be doing any heavy gaming so the base model was fine with me. So far is awesome. The glare isn't nearly as bad as people say, and the screen is the beautiful! The 500GB 5400rpm HDD is very snappy and I don't think I will be upgrading to a 7200rpm or SSD anytime soon. I think 4GB of ram is more than enough for anyone, but I may upgrade to 8GB of ram in the future. Battery life is beyond what they claim if you turn down the obvious battery drainers. (Backlight keyboard, Brightness, etc) The trackpad is ALOT better than what i thought! I may just have to buy the wireless trackpad soon. Other than those things this laptop is FAST and durable, and will be even better when Mac OS X Lion comes out in a few days.

So far this what I've bought for this laptop and recommend.
-Rain Mstand
-Logitech Anywhere mouse
-Mini Display to HDMI for dual screening with TVs
-Apple Wireless Keyboard
-USB Hub (Sadly it only has 2 USB ports)
-Moshi Clearguard Keyboard Protector (Strongly recommended if you want to keep it looking new)
This is my second Mac purchase. I had sold my last Macbook (White polycarbonate) to go traveling and bought a Dell instead. It wasn't the brightest idea I've ever had. My Dell wasn't an entry level laptop it was actually the XPS M1330 with all the options. After upgrading to Win7 I thought my laptop was fast enough and the screen was bright and crisp. After breaking it I decided it was time to go back to a mac. I wasn't disappointed.

This laptop can run laps around my Dell. Paired with a&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Seagate-Momentus-XT-500-GB-7200RPM-SATA-3Gb-s-32-MB-Cache-2-5-Inch-Solid-State-Hybrid-Drive-ST95005620AS-Bare-Drive/dp/B003NSBF32/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Seagate Momentus XT 500 GB 7200RPM SATA 3Gb/s 32 MB Cache 2.5 Inch Solid State Hybrid Drive ST95005620AS-Bare Drive</a>&nbsp;This laptop is faster than most $2300+ Windows computers and outperforms any windows pc in terms of start up/standby/resume/shutdown speed. I find that the graphics switching helps keep the laptop cool and the fan quiet under normal web browsing and document drafting. 3D drawings load quickly and you rarely find any lag while working on large 3D projects.

I only carry the charger everywhere with me because I never know when I'm going to be spending extra time in the library or spending all day away from home. However I rarely find that I need to plug in during a normal day of classes and some study time inside the library. In case you need to fuel up between meetings and whatnot the battery charges to 80% fairly quickly.

Usability is greatly improved over Windows machines with the extra large trackpad that conveniently doesn't get in the way while you're typing on the full size keyboard that is a joy to type on. I find that with the keys the way they're designed has me typing ~10 WPM more than other less intuitively designed keyboards. The backlight in the keys also help when you're on a plane or other dark places like certain lecture halls. It does however eat up more juice than I'd like.

If your anticipating on doing more Graphics design or 3D drawing I would suggest upgrading to the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Apple-MacBook-Pro-MC723LL-A-15-4-Inch-Laptop/dp/B0017HSZWK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Apple MacBook Pro MC723LL/A 15.4-Inch Laptop</a>&nbsp;otherwise this will be more than plenty to satisfy the general user and student. However I do suggest the 8GB RAM Memory kit for all you multi-taskers out there.
Although I truly enjoy PCs and will still continue to keep and use my PC laptop, I felt it was time for a change. It took minutes to load up videos and photos, and I was starting to get very frustrated with the entire process. I hadn't considered purchasing a Macbook Pro before, because I felt the cost wouldn't be worth it. I spent over a month researching and reading and watching reviews. I finally took the leap. The following describes features of the Macbook Pro that I find important to an everyday user.

External Appearance: I sometimes look at the laptop and get surprised by how thin it is. However, once I lift it up, I am surprised again by how heavy it is. Apple has done an amazing job at creating a laptop that thrives on outward simplicity. The cold aluminum feels strong and almost indestructible. The Magsafe adapter is a great feature to have, especially if you need to connect your laptop and sit further away. A trip over a cord easily separates the adapter from the laptop, and nothing is harmed. At first I was surprised that there were only two USB ports, but I can't imagine a time where I will need more than two. The difference I noticed from my other laptop is that there is a lack of ports which might add to the fact that it has an incredibly simple design and that it uses only what it needs. What it thrives on is what's inside.

The Screen: I was originally considering getting a large monitor for the Macbook Pro, so I could easily edit documents and pictures. It's not worth it. Even watching Youtube videos looks great. I was looking at pictures taken on a simple point and shoot camera, and they looked phenomenal on the screen as well. However, the glossy screen can seem like a mirror at times and can get incredibly annoying. 15.4 inches is perfect for anyone considering making the Macbook Pro their primary computer at home.

iLife & other apps: I haven't used iLife as much as I would want, but I was able to look at the Mac app store, and I am pleasantly surprised by the quality of apps provided. If you love writing, Scrivener is great for drafting stories, novels, screenplays, and poetry. iWork is also available at the app store. Each of them are sold separately for $20.00 each, which is cheaper than purchasing iWork altogether! Pages and Numbers are incredibly intuitive, and they definitely compete with Microsoft Word and Excel. Like the app store for the iPod Touch, iPhone, and iPad, there's something for everyone. There are apps for work, play, and everything in between.

Speed: From opening Safari to opening apps, there isn't a glitch in speed. Once I start editing film, I'll update if it changes but if not, that means it's still working amazingly. I did play a few games and not only are the graphics amazing, but there isn't any stopping or starting.

Finder: I didn't think it would be very useful until I downloaded a program and had no idea where it went. Finder (of course) finds every single thing on your Macbook Pro, but it does it with speed.

Trackpad: I wasn't sure whether or not I would like the trackpad. I didn't like the original settings but once I changed it, I'm not even considering getting a mouse. It's fun experimenting with it at first and learning the different motions on your own. The trackpad has made surfing the web easier than before.

Keyboard: I was hesitant about the backlit keyboard. I love that I can type at night, but I am used to the keys being closer together. It did take a couple of hours to get used to it but once I did, it vastly improved my typing speed. The spaces between the letters helped, and the fact that the keys aren't raised high definitely helps. Even better? The keys are practically silent.

Heat: I had read reviews about how hot a Macbook Pro gets but after a week, I haven't noticed any extreme heat. Again, I haven't done anything extreme, so I will update if it changes.

Portability: If you decide to take the laptop around, I would recommend getting a case for it. It is prone to scratches and dents, so any protection helps. I carry the laptop in my backpack, and the weight is quite noticeable. I think it's something I'll get used to, but I'm still surprised by its weight. It is, however, a great device to carry around but if I wanted it for true portability, I might have gone with the 13.3 inch or possibly a Macbook Air. Given the fact that this my primary device used at home, I prefer to keep it there unless I know I will absolutely need it.

The hard drive and RAM are completely replaceable. People were disappointed with the slow performing 5400 RPM hard drives, but I honestly don't see a difference in speed. If it is a huge problem, again, it can easily be upgraded. I plan on upgrading the RAM to 8gb soon. My initial benchmark test showed a score of 8843, so I'm excited to learn what the score will be after upgrading.

If there are any major changes with the laptop, I will update.

UPDATE:

The first thing I would like to update on is battery life. The battery life for the Macbook Pro is pretty good. I no longer worry during lectures or taking it to work. I average about six hours with going on the internet, watching a few videos, and writing.

Secondly, gaming on this machine is great. I played Left 4 Dead 2 for a few hours with a friend. There were maybe one or two times where the game would lag, but it would be for a split second. Other than that, it looks amazingly clear. Load up times for gaming is FAST. As soon as my game booted up, I would ask my friend where he was, and he was still only halfway done with loading. Playing with the trackpad is also very responsive and pretty fun. When gaming, the fan is loud and the laptop gets very hot. However, it's not as hot as my 2009 Toshiba laptop.

I was very worried about how hot the device gets after a period of time. After reading many reviews, I noticed that one of the main problems was the laptop getting so hot, it would burn someone's lap. However, I noticed that this was more a worry with previous generation's of the Macbook Pro, and I have yet to notice a real problem with it.

The speaker quality is amazing. I was originally going to get separate speakers and a mouse for the laptop, but it's not really worth it.

The great thing about this laptop is that it's small enough to take anywhere you need it, but it's powerful enough to use as a regular desktop.

Update #2 - 1 Month Later:

I thought I'd give one last update. Since people generally give reviews right after they receive a product, I think it would be great to give people an idea of how a product is running a month and a half into ownership

The first thing I would like to mention is lag time. A few times I've experienced considerable lag while trying to perform a few tasks. Once or twice it would happen while I was attempting to play a game. Or I'll attempt to switch out windows, and the infamous beach ball appears. What I would like to mention isn't about that lag itself but the performance AFTER it happens. Each time I experience this, I was tempted to press CTRL + ALT + DELETE (in typical Windows fashion) but after waiting a few seconds, my programs would run as usual. I don't have to restart or worry about my files being corrupted. No computer is without hiccups, but I would like to mention that this laptop is great at handling them. I no longer have to cross my fingers and close my eyes for five minutes while it reboots. It just works.

If you like creating short films or Youtube videos, the speed of creating and uploading films is incredibly fast and easy. After playing with iMovie and iPhoto, I'm glad they're additions to preinstalled programs. Although this isn't exactly a review of the laptop itself, I do enjoy the built in programs and how they easily integrate themselves with the Macbook Pro. The lack of bloatware is also very refreshing. When I first purchase a laptop, I spend the first hour or two attempting to delete free trials.

As someone who has used both PCs and Macs for the past decade, the choice really is up to the consumer. Honestly, I feel that both have very easy user interfaces and both are great for any project that might come up. Why did I choose a Mac over purchasing another PC? I think I was ready for something I wasn't used to in my own home. I've had two PC laptops that failed in less than two years of my persistent aggression. I also wanted impeccable design quality. I didn't want something that just looked good. I wanted it to be both functional and durable. It just so happened that the design for the Macbook Pro fits it all perfectly.

I hope this helps.
There are many different factors to consider when writing a review of a notebook, but I'm just going to go with the topics hardware and software.

First, the exterior/hardware. This is the first thing that you see when unboxing so it only felt right to start here. Of course when you open it you're in the awe of actually owning an Apple machine. The aluminum unibody is extremely attractive, clean, and just stunning. Then more time sets in, and if you're like me, you begin to inspect it, wondering if it really is as perfect as you first thought it to be. Upon inspection of this machine (my 1st of two, BTW) I noticed there were some flaws. First, I noticed when the lid was closed, there was a gap on the right side (the drive side) compared to the left. Upon further inspection, eyeballing at an angle I find hard to describe, I can see an imperfection in the form of the aluminum, as if it was bent. Secondly, after some use, I also noticed two of the backlighting on the keys, keys 'B' and '7' were noticeably dimmer than their counterparts. Lastly, upon inspecting the powercord, it looks like there are some imperfections in the sheathing...I don't know from what or how, but just another thing to make my mind boggle. For a machine of this price and from a company like Apple where form and function are supposedly equal, I personally could not 'suck it up' and live with these things, but I'm sure there are those out there who would...to each is own. But other than those things, it definitely is a striking machine that leaves an impression.

Second, the software. Being this is my first time owning an Apple and working with OS X, I have to say I am pleased right from the get go. It truly is simple to use. I don't know how else to explain it, but I've been using Windows for years, and after a short time, a couple weeks on a Mac, I feel quite oriented with it. Setting up things seem much less painful on a Mac, as the system often recognizes things in advance, ie setting up an internet connection. For the experienced, not impressive by any means, but for those who have trouble fathoming wireless anything, it works like it's supposed to without needing to be "experienced." I'm sitting here trying to think of a more compelling example to share, but all I can really tell you is that things work in a straight forward way. Recalling my Windows experiences, there are often multiple sidesteps that would be taken to finally reach a certain destination, but here its a straight shot.

Personal experience: As stated above, due to the hardware issues/imperfections, I bought a second MacBook Pro and returned the first one. I truly love my second one, as all the hardware imperfections are no longer there...the lid is even all the way around, the backlights work on all the keys, the power cord doesn't have any weird marks. I'm happy. I will say though, I don't know if Amazon was trying to be slick or if it's common practice, but the box this 2nd one came in I noticed had been opened before and a new clear piece of tape was placed over it. I'm not entirely sure what that means? I will also say too that the first one ran much cooler, as this one seems a bit warmer...(uh oh, did I make things worse for myself?) Not hot enough where I feel like I'm getting burned, but noticeably warmer...but I have read things about 'thermal paste' on these MBPs being excessively used, so I'm not sure...have to look further into that. But all in all, this is what I initially expected, form and function are top notch, as they should be to match the cost.

MBP #1: 3 stars
MBP #2: 4/4.5 stars (Would be 5 stars if it operated at the same cooler temperature as the first one)
after purchasing my copy of this computer was fun for kids introducing the kodak playsport witch is good and  takes video and is comadible with Mac after putting it in the computer I went to iMovie and had fun with the kids it is to take your vide and put to profection you just ad special effects and edit hardcore but fun in bussines it's good because I can print out things good and has and alarm to wake up at 6:00am for my job then come home at 4:30pm and repeat each day with a good time because of the Mac
I am a regular windows lap top and PC user but moving to MAC as from my phone and iPad experiences but mostly, because my kids push for...
Bought this one for my son who is becoming and architect and tried it here in the states before going home.  Is superb! I however did the registration on my name...and  What a mistake!.  Apple store don't allow me to change or buy under my sons name and even worse, have to pay in the currency they want ...
Hope Apple one day think in the customers and people with rights to chose and then free a little their over controlling rules.
Super fast, very powerful. It still makes a little fan noise but it is much better than I old laptop. Good deal.
My wife bought me a Macbook Pro 15 about 6 weeks ago.  I'm on my 3rd machine in 3 weeks.  This is ridiculous.  The first one lasted about 3 weeks before the battery swelled to the point that it made the trackpad inoperable.  Luckily it was within 30 days of purchasing from Best Buy, they exchanged it for a new one.  This is fortunate since I first called apple and they wanted me to send it in for a repair that was going to take 4-6 weeks to complete.  I was not willing to spend this kind of money on a laptop and have it in for repair longer than I had it.  The new one was only two days old and I picked it up by the screen and the glass cover fractured.  Now this is something I have done with larger Windows based laptops for 10 years and have never had an issue. Took some arguing with Best Buy but they exchanged it again for a new one. I'm afraid to use this thing for fear of denting the aluminum housing, or damaging it again.  But my trusty windows laptops have travelled the world with me and never had these types of issues.  Aside from how fragile and delicate this laptop is, I love the macbook it is fast and it is awesome to use,  too bad I'm afraid to take it out of the house with me.
I don't really feel like writing a large review, I think a lot of other people have covered just about everything. It is the perfect size, and can handle just about anything I throw at it. Coming from a PC I have really grown to love OSX because even though I spent a lot of time on my windows machines making them run there best and getting rid of crapware and garbage, I really never have had to worry about that on the Mac, everything just works. I did upgrade to 8GB of RAM right out of the gate and it works great. I would say my only worry is that I did not go for the bigger graphics card, with Battlefield 3 coming out, I don't think I will be able to play it. And with VMware Fusion it makes it very easy to run most windows programs if I need too, except for games, which I can just run in Boot Camp. And VMWare will just run my bootcamp partition as a VM which is really sweet. I'll just say I love this machine, hopefully it keeps a lot of its value and I might be able to sell it in a few years and upgrade to a new one!
I bought this computer for my son in March.  For a week it worked fine, then it hung.  Apple support is totally unable to fix it.  Beware Apple hype about their products and, particularly, their ridiculous support.<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Apple-MacBook-Pro-MB133LL-A-15-4-inch-Laptop-2-4-GHz-Intel-Core-2-Duo-Processor-2-GB-RAM-200-GB-Hard-Drive-DVD-CD-SuperDrive/dp/B0013FLU96/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Apple MacBook Pro MB133LL/A 15.4-inch Laptop (2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo Processor, 2 GB RAM, 200 GB Hard Drive, DVD/CD SuperDrive)</a>
This is my first Mac. After listening to my daughter and others rave about theirs, I finally decided to get one. It takes a little getting used to the differences in navigation as compared to a PC, but I love how fast it is and the awesome battery life. The screen display is really sharp and the backlit keyboard is wonderful since I often work on it at night when the lights are set pretty low. The laptop shipped quickly and was in perfect shape when it arrived.
I just received my new macbook pro 15'' the other day and i am inlove it came fast in perfect shape and with great packing! I wish amazon was a person so i could hug it. lol
The 15" is worth it, it's not too small or too big and heavy like the 17". the 17 has it's place like home or office. the 13" is slower, check out the i5-i7 spec's.  The duel boot to Windows7 or Mac is too cool.  I got the square trade 2 year just in case.
A2DP BLUETOOTH UPDATE: For whatever reason, OS X 10.6.7 has a minimum allowable bit rate for A2DP Bluetooth stereo audio so low as to render the resulting audio -profoundly- depressing.  -Especially- if you have the foxL v2 portable speaker(s), and become accustomed to fairly amazing sound quality on the thing under W7.  Not to worry however: Xcode costs 4.99USD on the Apple AppStore, and within it is a utility called "Bluetooth Explorer".  Running this utility (find it w/Spotlight) and going to "Utilities", "Special Options" allows you to set "Use dynamic bitpool values" to something higher than "2".  I found that setting it up to 64 meant not being able to connect to the foxL, but backing down to 50ish bits or so works well, and the audio quality, while not incredible, is at least tolerable to surprisingly good.

SSD/TRIM UPDATE: For whatever reasons, neither my OS X 10.6.7 nor BootCamp W7 installs recognized my Samsung SSD as supporting TRIM.  I have enabled TRIM support in both OS X and W7, and things have sped up even quite a bit more - astonishing.  IF YOU DO THE SAME, YOU DO SO AT YOUR OWN INITIATIVE, AND AT YOUR OWN RISK. -jmc

The thing to remember is: this is just a personal computer.  Just like a-l-l the many personal computers I have had over a period spanning more than two decades.  No, not just like those.

PHYSICAL

The physical workmanship is . . well . . I have sat in Mercedes Benz's that weren't machined, built or constructed this nicely.  My dad was a watchmaker in his heyday - this laptop actually refreshes my memory of the attention to detail and execution that I observed as a child, looking at the various watch and clock mechanisms laying about my dad's workbench.  In short: Magnifique (a pun).  Even the lack of <Home>, <End> and  keys  cannot deter - sort of.  How sad [I thought] that I now own yet another piece of Chinese manufacture - certainly the best example of same, however.  I did put a Speck protective skin on it, and blocked the "STEAL ME - NOW!" light on the back of the lid with the thinnest aluminum foil I could find, so it looks from the outside like a two-year old, $350 laptop.  Just how I like it to look - from the outside.

SOFTWARE

The OS X operating system, for all the religious fervor of its head-shaven, robe-wearing adherents, is not really better than Windows 7 but rather, different.  It is missing some truly fundamental business networking and operational functions or rather, those functions are dissembled into their various nooks and crannies instead of consolidated in the way they are in W7.  Regardless, I DO LIKE IT BETTER than W7.  It is somehow, inexplicably, LESS STRESSFUL.  Even when I was staying up all weekend 'til 3AM trying to migrate enough of my Dell XPS stuff to use the MBP at work on Monday, it was not as tooth-grinding an exercise as it might have been if I was moving just from one Windows laptop to another.  Go figure.

It was however REALLY DISAPPOINTING to see just how easily the HFS partition can be completely compromised, and how glibly the documentation calls out reformatting and reinstalling everything as the correct course of action.  So much for Microsoft being the arbiter of the absurd.  YOU HAD BETTER BE CAREFUL, especially when employing Boot Camp or other, dual-OS solutions, and -do- be sure to have an external backup that can function in both camps, before potentially sawing off the limb one is standing on.

PERFORMANCE

The OS reports 8 CPU cores and not just 4, which I thought was interesting.  Regardless, this thing s f-a-s-t.  The BBOD does come to visit from time to time, particularly when handling certain downloads or archives that have something odd about them, but it is nothing like the old days - my last Mac was a toaster (Classic), and I gave away a lot of my best years, watching the Beach Ball as my beard grew out.  No more of that, I can tell you.

This thing has a SATA 3 interface - Oy!  My transplanted Samsung 256GB SSD is SATA 2 - it was the fastest high-density SSD available at the time of original purchase.  I was underwhelmed at the mild (but definite) performance improvement it brought to the MBP.  BUT THE RAM!  Oh. My. Gawdness.  Going from 4GB to 8GB truly means [almost] never having to say you're sorry.  The speedup of operations with both the SSD and RAM upgrade are almost frighteningly effective.

The Battery life is so-so.  Not amazing (even before the RAM upgrade, and even after the lower consumption SSD), not bad - about 3.75 to 4.25 hours, beating on it the whole time pretty much.  I may try and "recalibrate", or may not.

The display (1440X900) is really beyond: beyond gorgeous, beyond visually sweet, beyond, beyond, beyond.  My tired ole' Acer 2223W VGA flat screen looks somehow better than it did running externally off of my Dell XPS, if that's possible.  My ViewSonic HD flat screen however was trying to look crappy, until I corrected its imput from "A/V" to "PC", did a color calibration, etc. - it now looks quite excellent. I am using Kanex dongles for both the VGA and HDMI.

EPILOGUE

At about twice the cost of an "equivalent" Intel/Windows solution, you should ask yourself, "WHY?"  Then, carve out a solid hour or so to go play with one at your nearest retailer, and the answer will come to you - honest.
I bought the MacBook Pro 2.2Ghz in May 2008 with 1600$. I was very excited.

Usually, laptop performed very well and I enjoyed the MAC OS X (I work in IT for 9 years with Windows95-Windows7/2003Server-whatever, Linux and now.. Mac OS). However:

Problems I had in these 3 years:

- battery broke: one year max.; I said, OK, this is normal for all laptops what can I expect, no problem; then I looked at the price for a new battery and I said 'mehhh .. a bit much' and never bought it.
- from time to time after 1.5 years max., I got grey screens and the screen wouldn't come up; I needed to try and reboot the laptop multiple times.
- overheated when I put an Windows 7 dual boot at some time and found out it's a Bootcamp driver issue for the FANs or something like it; the FANs were not spinning at max speed in Windows 7 but only up to 3000-3500rpm (instead of 6000rpm in Mac OS X); I deleted the Windows 7 and put VMware with Windows 7 in Mac OS X and ... was OK with it.
- After 2 years, I couldn't see anything on the screen no matter how many times I tried to boot-up. I took it to an authorized Apple dealer in my country to look at it and I payed around 80 euros for investigation- they said maybe the NVIDIA chipset problem but after further investigation they said it something wrong with the logic board actually but they managed to make it work but they won't guarantee it will last for long; they offered 3 months of warranty; it cost me an additional 50Euros for this.
- After exactly 3 years, again the same problem, but I moved to different country still in Europe (Belgium); they told me the investigation costs 85Euros and I payed; after 5 days they made a report: logic board faulty, total costs 1287 Euros!!!!

Now, I ask you, any smart guy out there, who the hell will pay for this? And why should I buy ever again a MAC? So many problems, so EXPENSIVE repair?? This is outrageous.. and this was IT for me: I'll switch to a normal DELL/HP/Whatever laptop instead. Not to mention, that I think this is very well calculated: instead of repairing, buy a new laptop - forced.

In conclusion:

1) it really doesn't matter what to buy because all the components are the SAME, CHINA made and eventually after max 2-3 years will brake. This is our world today. Just buy a regular laptop with +++ years of warranty if possible and that's the best option.

2) if you have money to spend, go for it.

Sincerely,
A Former Customer.

PS> I also have an iPhone 4 and wanted to buy MacBook Air because I saw the new technology in it, but after this... I quit the idea; it doesn't worth it.

I resisted the change from Windows to Mac for years and I now have to ask myself, well, why?  This computer is so easy to use and the programs just run so much faster than the PC.  After struggling with all the "wonders" of Vista with the never-ending updates, crashes and system failures it is like a breath of fresh air.

Issues I came up against in the "switch":  I had to input a lot of my data from my old Palm Pilot again.  Much I could copy and paste but some had to be input again, but that only took me about 1.5 days.  I changed over to the iPod Touch for all the Palm Pilot functions and now have a system that runs better, faster and in color too.

I missed the numeric keypad that I had on my previous machine and bought a separate bluetooth keypad.  That is OK, and runs fairly well but does have to "wake up" if you haven't used it for a few minutes, and it is a separate bit of kit to carry round.

I also found that Excel runs OK, but without a couple of the standard items such as being able to insert a row with a keypad sequence.  On the Windows machine I could press H-I-R and a row would go in, H-I-C and there was a column, H-D-R deletes the row etc.  With this Mac version I have to record some macros at the start of my day to do this same things, but that is just a minor irritation. It doesn't save that from day-to-day unless I run Excel as an older version.  The Mac "Numbers" program does do this but I didn't like that as well as Excel.

Windows Publisher isn't available for a Mac as far as I can see, and I miss that.  The Mac "Pages" is OK, but I prefered Publisher.

I also run some knitting software and found that not all of that was available on a Mac, although I hear they are working on it.

Apart from those minor issues, everything else is running faster, smoother and without all the Interminable Updates happening 10 times a day and I now have a smaller, lighter computer that is great to work with.
Note: This review is from someone who knows very little about computers.

Although I truly enjoy PCs and will still continue to keep and use my PC laptop, I felt it was time for a change.  It took minutes to load up videos and photos, and I was starting to get very frustrated with the entire process.  I hadn't considered purchasing a Macbook Pro before, because I felt the cost wouldn't be worth it.  I spent over a month researching and reading and watching reviews.  I finally took the leap.  The following describes features of the Macbook Pro that I find important to an everyday user.

External Appearance: I sometimes look at the laptop and get surprised by how thin it is.  However, once I lift it up, I am surprised again by how heavy it is.  Apple has done an amazing job at creating a laptop that thrives on outward simplicity.  The cold aluminum feels strong and almost indestructible.  The Magsafe adapter is a great feature to have, especially if you need to connect your laptop and sit further away.  A trip over a cord easily separates the adapter from the laptop, and nothing is harmed.  At first I was surprised that there were only two USB ports, but I can't imagine a time where I will need more than two.  The difference I noticed from my other laptop is that there is a lack of ports which might add to the fact that it has an incredibly simple design and that it uses only what it needs.  What it thrives on is what's inside.

The Screen: I was originally considering getting a large monitor for the Macbook Pro, so I could easily edit documents and pictures.  It's not worth it.  Even watching Youtube videos looks great.  I was looking at pictures taken on a simple point and shoot camera, and they looked phenomenal on the screen as well.  However, the glossy screen can seem like a mirror at times and can get incredibly annoying.  15.4 inches is perfect for anyone considering making the Macbook Pro their primary computer at home.

iLife & other apps: I haven't used iLife as much as I would want, but I was able to look at the Mac app store, and I am pleasantly surprised by the quality of apps provided.  If you love writing, Scrivener is great for drafting stories, novels, screenplays, and poetry.  iWork is also available at the app store.  Each of them are sold separately for $20.00 each, which is cheaper than purchasing iWork altogether!  Pages and Numbers are incredibly intuitive, and they definitely compete with Microsoft Word and Excel.  Like the app store for the iPod Touch, iPhone, and iPad, there's something for everyone.  There are apps for work, play, and everything in between.

Speed: From opening Safari to opening apps, there isn't a glitch in speed.  Once I start editing film, I'll update if it changes but if not, that means it's still working amazingly.  I did play a few games and not only are the graphics amazing, but there isn't any stopping or starting.

Finder: I didn't think it would be very useful until I downloaded a program and had no idea where it went.  Finder (of course) finds every single thing on your Macbook Pro, but it does it with speed.

Trackpad: I wasn't sure whether or not I would like the trackpad.  I didn't like the original settings but once I changed it, I'm not even considering getting a mouse.  It's fun experimenting with it at first and learning the different motions on your own.  The trackpad has made surfing the web easier than before.

Keyboard: I was hesitant about the backlit keyboard.  I love that I can type at night, but I am used to the keys being closer together.  It did take a couple of hours to get used to it but once I did, it vastly improved my typing speed.  The spaces between the letters helped, and the fact that the keys aren't raised high definitely helps.  Even better? The keys are practically silent.

Heat: I had read reviews about how hot a Macbook Pro gets but after a week, I haven't noticed any extreme heat.  Again, I haven't done anything extreme, so I will update if it changes.

Portability: If you decide to take the laptop around, I would recommend getting a case for it.  It is prone to scratches and dents, so any protection helps.  I carry the laptop in my backpack, and the weight is quite noticeable.  I think it's something I'll get used to, but I'm still surprised by its weight.  It is, however, a great device to carry around but if I wanted it for true portability, I might have gone with the 13.3 inch or possibly a Macbook Air.  Given the fact that this my primary device used at home, I prefer to keep it there unless I know I will absolutely need it.

The hard drive and RAM are completely replaceable.  People were disappointed with the slow performing 5400 RPM hard drives, but I honestly don't see a difference in speed.  If it is a huge problem, again, it can easily be upgraded.  I plan on upgrading the RAM to 8gb soon.  My initial benchmark test showed a score of 8843, so I'm excited to learn what the score will be after upgrading.

If there are any major changes with the laptop, I will update.

UPDATE:

The first thing I would like to update on is battery life.  The battery life for the Macbook Pro is pretty good.  I no longer worry during lectures or taking it to work.  I average about six hours with going on the internet, watching a few videos, and writing.

Secondly, gaming on this machine is great.  I played Left 4 Dead 2 for a few hours with a friend.  There were maybe one or two times where the game would lag, but it would be for a split second.  Other than that, it looks amazingly clear.  Load up times for gaming is FAST.  As soon as my game booted up, I would ask my friend where he was, and he was still only halfway done with loading.  Playing with the trackpad is also very responsive and pretty fun.  When gaming, the fan is loud and the laptop gets very hot.  However, it's not as hot as my 2009 Toshiba laptop.

I was very worried about how hot the device gets after a period of time.  After reading many reviews, I noticed that one of the main problems was the laptop getting so hot, it would burn someone's lap.  However, I noticed that this was more a worry with previous generation's of the Macbook Pro, and I have yet to notice a real problem with it.

The speaker quality is amazing.  I was originally going to get separate speakers and a mouse for the laptop, but it's not really worth it.

The great thing about this laptop is that it's small enough to take anywhere you need it, but it's powerful enough to use as a regular desktop.

 Update #2 - 1 Month Later:

I thought I'd give one last update.  Since people generally give reviews right after they receive a product, I think it would be great to give people an idea of how a product is running a month and a half into ownership

The first thing I would like to mention is lag time.  A few times I've experienced considerable lag while trying to perform a few tasks.  Once or twice it would happen while I was attempting to play a game.  Or I'll attempt to switch out windows, and the infamous beach ball appears.  What I would like to mention isn't about that lag itself but the performance AFTER it happens.  Each time I experience this, I was tempted to press CTRL + ALT + DELETE (in typical Windows fashion) but after waiting a few seconds, my programs would run as usual.  I don't have to restart or worry about my files being corrupted.  No computer is without hiccups, but I would like to mention that this laptop is great at handling them.  I no longer have to cross my fingers and close my eyes for five minutes while it reboots.  It just works.

If you like creating short films or Youtube videos, the speed of creating and uploading films is incredibly fast and easy.  After playing with iMovie and iPhoto, I'm glad they're additions to preinstalled programs.  Although this isn't exactly a review of the laptop itself, I do enjoy the built in programs and how they easily integrate themselves with the Macbook Pro.  The lack of bloatware is also very refreshing.  When I first purchase a laptop, I spend the first hour or two attempting to delete free trials.

As someone who has used both PCs and Macs for the past decade, the choice really is up to the consumer.  Honestly, I feel that both have very easy user interfaces and both are great for any project that might come up.  Why did I choose a Mac over purchasing another PC?  I think I was ready for something I wasn't used to in my own home.  I've had two PC laptops that failed in less than two years of my persistent aggression.  I also wanted impeccable design quality.  I didn't want something that just looked good.  I wanted it to be both functional and durable.  It just so happened that the design for the Macbook Pro fits it all perfectly.

I hope this helps.

9/15/2011 Update:

This is the last update.  I promise.  I have had this product for close to five months, and I've definitely had some ups and downs with it.  I've noticed that while watching Netflix, there's considerable lag when I have more than three programs open.  I have to force quit Safari from time to time due to a very sluggish performance.  At some point, I really want to upgrade the RAM and update the hard drive, but I'm waiting for prices of SSDs to go down.

Despite this, it continues to amaze me.  For the first time in my life, I can open up my laptop and not have to wait a few minutes for it to load up.  It's just there.  The issue of portability is nonexistent, as I never have to bring my charger if I'm going somewhere for a day or two.  The battery life is phenomenal.  I have been scanning and uploading a lot of pictures, and it handles it with ease.  Creating videos is still a fun process.

While the cover is aluminum, it is still very fragile.  I do have a couple of small scratches on the bottom.  It still continues to go strong.

I will actually update this a year from now to see how it really holds up.  A year is right when I need a new laptop.  We'll see if it can take the abuse.
As a Mac user since the 80's SE, I appreciate the attention to the blending of art and design with technology. As always, Apple has continued the tradition with the Mac unibody design + the new Thunderbolt port + quad-core i7 Intel chip, etc. I'm a pleased owner.
I'm over all happy with my new mac...this is my first. it's fast battery life is AMAZING!!!! even right now. I unplugged it this morning...it's been on for about 8 hours and i still have 2 hours left! WHAT!?!?!?!?! unheard of. it's crazy i run Photoshop CS5, Apatrure, Final Cut, Lightroom, and others....And the Rendering time incredible...5 star :)
This is an AWESOME laptop. I had an Asus G50vt before I switched to mac and I am very happy I did. It loads up EXTREMELY fast and the interface is easy to use and navigate. I love everything about it. The battery life is amazing!!!! Unplugged it runs for 8-9 hours without being recharged or anything. I am a college student so that is perfect for me. I just whip it out in the morning pack it into my backpack and go. I don't have to worry about the charger or anything. My only regret, is that I didn't switch to Macs earlier. Fast start up, fast processor, LONNNNGGGGGGGG battery Life (just for emphasis) and beautiful design. Truly amazing.
Dead on arrival laptop - As soon as I powered on my new laptop for the 1st time , the battery icon said "replace now". After next boot said "not installed" and finally "not charging". Called apple support and they asked me to reset the SMC, which didn't solve the problem. SO they asked me to get a replacement. Before that, I Googled for issues on this new laptop and found many issues related to battery, the new graphic card and hard freeze, so decided to return this laptop instead of getting a replacement. Didn't want to be stressed out after paying 2000$ for a laptop. Would prefer a high end viao instead for 65% of the price. I think with the many design changes that happened year: new intel chip, new graphic card, apple has some design issues like the antennagate issue.
Before you order the Microsoft Windows CD for your MacBook Pro, notice it's not for a Mac, it's for a PC! Why Amazon would place these incompatible products together in the same ad is beyond me. Be careful and make sure you understand what you are ordering. Love the MacBook Pro, it replaces my 5 year old MacBook. It was time for a new one with all the new features.
This new 15 inch quad-core Macbook Pro is a powerhouse of an upgrade from my 2006 15 inch Macbook Pro (Dual Core). I've always been a fan of Apple products and welcome this new line of Macbook Pros with open arms. Lets go straight to the pros and cons of this Laptop in comparison to my old 2006 MBP:
NOTE: This laptop is mostly used for motion graphics and photography.

PROS:
- Intel i7 quad core - Amazingly faster than my Core 2 Duo. The name itself makes me jiggle: "Intel i7 quad core"

- Unibody Action - The overall look and feel of this laptop is solid. It's a few ounces lighter than the 2006 MBP and much more thinner.

- Firewire 800 - Just about all my drives are either Firewire 400 or Firewire 800 so I'm extremely thankful that Apple included this.

- Keyboard - The keyboard took a bit of time getting used to compared to my the 2006 MBP because the keys are spaced out vs being flushed side by side. I actually like the black keyboard layout because now I'm no longer hitting the wrong keys when super typing. I also like how the keys are flush-level with the rest of the laptop surface preventing the common keyboard dirt ghosting that was apparent with the pre'UniBody set-ups. Thank goodness.

- AMD Radeon HD 6490M Graphics card - Working in 3D - Cinema 4D to be exact... the AMD Graphics Card is a beast. It does what it does and very well at that.

- THUNDERBOLT - Having this feature makes me feel powerful. Like the the Mighty Thor or Zeus. Unfortunately, there aren't any accessories or peripherals currently out that support this new technology but with Canon and Lacie working on new gadgets that will, it's got me on the edge of my seat waiting for em.

- Battery Life - Goodness Gracious: A 7 Hour Battery life? The 2006 MBP barely scratches a 3 hour life cycle before it Hybernate. Working with power hungry applications such as After Effects, Cinema 4D and Photshop, I noticed that I can squeeze between 5 to 5 1/2 hours of non-stop computer on a battery charge. Amazing.

CONS:
I hate complaining about something that I made the choice to purchase but heck, you gotta have Cons if you're going to have Pros.

- Glossy Screen - Back in the day, one would pay a premium to get a Apple Laptop with a glossy screen. Now, the tables have turned and it's the other way around. I want my Matte screen. Yes, I could have custom build one on Apple's site but we don't want to go that route right? Many complain about the glossy screen's reflective ability but this hasn't been a problem for me as I use this laptop 99% of the time connected to an external monitor.

- Slot Orientation - My goodness, this is probably the one thing that causes me to raise my fist in the air at Apple with anger. On my 2006 MBP, all USB, Firewire, Monitor, headphone jack etc were located on the right hand side for right handed people... simple Well, with these new UniBody Macbook Pros, Apple decided to sneakly  rotate the orientation of everything from the right to the left side causing the evil left dungeon of ourselves to unlock anger inside. I guess the easy solution is to purchase cable extenders. Left Handers rejoice, Right Handers sob.

-Sometimes I feel like all the "WANT" upgrades that Apple offers in addition to what's already included is something that these laptops should come with for the price that these things cost. The average price for a PC Laptop is around $700 or so, yet Apple still feels like they can get away with charging nearly $2,000 for a laptop and they obviously still can get away with it because I just purchased one.
Yes they're expensive but considering their quality, their beauty, and Apple's amazing costumer service, this purchase is still a win. You can easily purchase a $200 netbook and call it a day but Apple's Macbook Pros are truly worth it.

Overall, I am extremely pleased with my purchase and will continue to purchase Apple products for as long as Apple continues with their amazing quality and customer service. If I had a few extra bucks, I would have purchased the 2.2 ghz model to get the better Graphics Card but I'm truly happy with the model I have.

Thanks for checking out my review.
First, the operating system is that much better than windows. It does take a little getting used to if you aren't familiar with Macs, but once you get a good feel for where everything is located you realize that the system is much more intuitive and geared to the user than windows. The battery life is outstanding, the processor is incredibly fast, and if you get a solid state hard drive the thing is indestructible. I can't tell you how many times I've dropped mine with zero problems.
Same slim shape as the previous MacBook pros; but the speed is incredible.  Awesome with sound and video editing.
Only problem I still have with MacBooks is that they have too few USB ports for users with printers/scanners/external hardrives etc.
Though fast, this computer keyboard does NOT function on the control/Home or control/End. As someone who works in long documents, this is incredibly frustrating. When I called Mac for assistance they said it was a Microsoft problem. After hours with Microsoft, it proves to be a keyboard (ie. MAC) problem - when i attached a separate keyboard the keys did the proper function.  Mac simply advised that i use the Scroll to get to the beginning/end of documents. On a forty, or fifty page piece, this is not useful.
I bought this machine a little over a month ago, it replaced my Powerbook G3 1.5 Ghz.  From the moment I have started using it, I have been quite impressed on how well it performs.

Keep in mind that you MUST add RAM to it, the 512 MB that it comes with are nothing.  With that much memory, working with Rosetta apps (binaries that were build for PPC) will really slow down your system.  I upgraded to 1.5 GB and this thing FLIES.  For example, when using handbrake to create an mp4 file from a movie DVD, it took my old Powerbook around 4 hours.  The MBP can do it in 45 minutes which totally blows me away.

Keep in mind that at the time of this writing, there are many apps out there (Adobe Photoshop, Dreamweaver) that will not run at full native speed.  This does not mean they are unbearable to work with, they are just not running as fast as they could.  I use Photoshop on weekly basis for designing web pages.  Its speed is like that of using Photoshop on my iMac G5 - so trust me, its not bad at all.  As I have mentioned before, cram it with RAM and things will work great.

Performance-wise it is top notch.  With the recent release of Boot Camp, you can now easily run Windows on a separate partition.  This should really be tempting to some Windows users out there that want to try OS X but are scared of not liking it and then being stuck with a machine they won't use.  If you are Windows user, do yourself a favor and get this laptop.  In case you hate OS X, just boot under Windows and you will be right at home.  Recent benchmarks that I have read of comparable Acer systems leave the MPB as a clear contender even when running Windows XP.

The backlit keyboard, iSight, the remote control are just extras that put icing on the cake.  I have never been so happy with a machine in my life.  It is so great to be running multiple apps and see the Activity Monitor's CPU usage stay around 10%!

I really can't say more, I love this machine.
I do not dispute the fine qualities this computer has as described by previous reviewers.  Compared to my old titanium powerbook this one far outshines it.  For it's advantages alone I give it 4.5 stars.

But one thing I did not anticipate this glorious machine to have is a despicable high pitched sound that it constantly emits.  3.5 stars.  I thought I was only imagining things but when I searched google I was surprised to see that the sound is very common and bothers other people as well.  But it is also noted that not all people notice the sound nor that each machine bought will emit the sound.  Luck of the draw, I guess.  The sound will only dissapear either by turning on Photobooth or turning down the brightness of the screen to very dim (as in my case).  Sometimes my ears become accustomed but it is an annoyance knowing that it is still there, especially because of the price paid for the computer.

So if you want the latest and greatest, cannot hear high pitched sounds, or are not easily annoyed by all means please purchase it.  Otherwise it might be best to either wait for a second generation MacBook Pro without the kinks or put up with the annoying sound.  Good luck.
It's a wonderful upgrade from my G3 iBook, but I was hoping for more speed. I'll start with my complaints and then my compliments :)

Complaints:

I'm in the Graphic Design field and use programs like Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign, Dreamweaver and Flash (Creative Suites 2 Web Bundle) often two or three at the same time. The Rossette (sp?) program works well although the programs do take slightly longer to open, you don't really notice unless you are in a rush. Going between the programs seems to take a bit of time (4-15 sec) and files take some time to open as well (5-45sec, over a minute on really large files). Sometimes it can be a bit frustrating as I was expecting much faster results.

I would suggest if you are in design or other high processing profession you go ahead and upgrade to the version with the 2 GHz Intel Dual Core, 1G Ram and 100GB hard drive not to mention the better video card as you will undoubtably have to upgrade your RAM almost immediately. It will not be enough to efficiently run your programs and that could cost $100+ anway since you can't install it by just opening up your keyboard panel.

It does get VERY hot after extended use, but this doesn't seem to affect performance, well except for the burning on the legs.

And one more silly complaint, the plug base is huge (not the part the plugs into the computer but the other end). It's about 2x as big as my G3 iBook model so it takes up more room in my travel bag.

Now for the good stuff.

I absolutely adore the power plug. I know that is an odd comment but I'm a clutz and the plug prevents me from flinging the computer across the room.

Also the independent video card (seperate from the motherboard) allows me to play games online (my current favorite is World of Warcraft).

The screen is large and has beautiful picture. The new applications are cute and fun to play with. The size is perfect for travel, I often use it on the train. The extended area down from the keyboard, next to the mouse is more ergonomic and you wrists don't sag (anyone who has used a smaller lap top know's what I'm talking about). The USB ports on either side make it easy to plug in other components like a mouse, scanner, camera, etc.

The DVD burner works just fine, and it's so nice to be able to burn DVD's (the G3iBook only had CD)

Overall I gave it a 4. I really wish now I would have dished out the extra $500 for the upgraded one, but it is able to run all of my programs without too much trouble, except the afore mentioned slow response. It works wonderfully for my online gaming (Bluetooth and Wireless anyone?) and the thin, sleek design makes it great for transport. It's amazing how much they were able to fit into such a small area. I will need to upgrade my RAM soon and hopefully that will improve the graphic programs speed, but other then that I am very satisfied.
I converted to macintosh last year and so far so good.

I recently upgraded from an ibook to the 15" macbook bro. Most of the marketing statements by apple and positive reviews are essentially accurate. The machine is stunning and it is fast!

However, I notice the the notebook gets exccessively hot after a couple of hours use. Its hot enough for you not to be able to place it on your laps! I had to buy a notebook cooler to reduce the heat.

I thought my notebook was defective and complained to apple. I was told the heat is to be expected in view of the thin size of the notebook. They casually told me that that is why it is called a notebook and not a laptop!

I went to an apple repair shop to check it out and was also told the heat is normal!

Strangely, the macbook pro manual also states that the notebook should not be placed on the lap or against the skin for a long period to avoid skin irritation.

I have used other small laptops like ibm, toshiba and sony vaio and the heat generated is negligible. Perhaps there is a compability problem between the new intel processors and apple.
It's the most stunning idea, isn't it? We talk about usability, but people always want to know about the speed.  This MacBook Pro is the second fastest Mac notebook ever, only slower to the more expensive model of this same release.

When Steve Jobs announced the new Macs, with Intel Core Duo processors I was almost certain I wanted to buy one. Why? Macs are well known for ease of use and capabilities, but they have managed all that for years, with processors that are not always top-notch. That all changed in January 2006.

Processor in the new MacBook Pro

The Intel Core Duo processor in the new MacBook Pro is an amazing chip. What have I noticed about the speed of the machine featuring this chip? It is incredibly fast. You'd be surprised by how much faster even web browsing is, when you have a processor as powerful as the Core Duo. However, what I've really been impressed by is doing things such as video encoding. I've encoded videos in H264 as much as eight times faster than my Powerbook G4. Furthermore, the iLife applications that are included on the MacBook Pro fly, with the speed. iPhoto, iMovie, iDVD, and Garageband perform like never before. I've really been impressed by the speed.

The Core Duo is a great processor. It offers exceptional desktop PC performance, in a design that can fit in small computers and notebooks. It features two cores on a single die, which effectively gives you the performance of two processors. Don't let the 1.83 GHZ clock speed fool you. This Core Duo Chip will outperform 3+ GHZ Pentium 4 processors. It really is an amazing breakthrough, from Intel.

Video Card

The new MacBook Pro 2 GHZ model features an ATI Radeon X1600 graphics processor using PCI Express 128 MB of GDDR3 video memory. This is one of the best video cards Apple has ever included in a notebook. This graphic processor will work well for most gaming, and it is great for viewing back complex H264 movies, including high definition videos. You can enjoy high definition H264 videos, without drop frames.

Ports -

The MacBook Pro features 2 USB 2.0 ports, 1 Firewire 400 port, Gigabit Ethernet, audio in/out, and Expresscard (34 slot).

Display - Apple touts the display on the new MacBook Pro as bright as the cinema displays, and there is no question: these displays are bright! Depending on your lighting condition, you'll almost certainly not turn the display to full brightness. I had to turn down the brightness, for it was hard on my eyes. However, it is nice to know the brightness is there, when needed. The native resolution is 1440x900 giving you plenty of screen real estate, to keep the applications you need visible.

Video out - The new MacBook Pro has a DVI video output. An adapter is also included to output VGA. There is an optional adapter available to output S-Video and composite video. Furthermore, the DVI video out supports up to a 30-inch Apple Cinema Display (or other comparable display). This gives you great possibilities. You can easily use your MacBook Pro on the road, but plug it into a keyboard, mouse, and huge display, when at your desk. The perfect all around system.

Memory - This Mac is a powerhouse, but the included 512 MB of memory holds it back. You really need more memory in this machine. The MacBook Pro supports up to 2 GB of memory. It uses PC5300 DDR2 - SODIMM modules, so you can order some and install it yourself.  Crucial and Other World Computing are two online stores to consider purchasing memory.  Amazon does not have this specific memory available.

Applications -

Apple includes iLife '06, which has iPhoto, iMovie, iWeb, iDVD, and Garageband. There is the Safari web browser, the always useful iCal, AddressBook, iChat, etc. Overall, I was pleased with the included software.

iLife 06 is particularly great. I love the new full-screen photo editing, photo comparing, etc. You can now also order calendars and greeting cards made with your photos, direct from Apple, by using the iPhoto software. iMovie has new themes, which helps make professional-looking home movies, and iDVD now supports widescreen DVDs. iWeb is a brand-new applications, which makes it easy to create professional quality webpages, quickly. I can't wait to rebuild by site using iWeb. Apple continues to make it easy to create music, manage your digital images, make movies, and create web sites.

A trial (30 day) of iWork '06 is also included, which includes the page layout program Pages, and the presentation program Keynote (which makes presentations that blow away presentations made by rival Powerpoint).

Hard Drive -

This model of the MacBook Pro includes a 80 GB 5400 RPM hard drive. This is going to be sufficient for most people to hold their photographs and music.  However, you won't much video on here.  You can always use an external drive, when at your desk. It is also important that you remember to backup your important files to either another external hard drive, or DVDs. I only point this out because today with great machines like the MacBook Pro we're storing more of our great memories on computers than ever before, so make sure you don't lose them, if something happens to your machine. Apple includes a great backup program called Backup 3, if you subscribe to the .mac service. I use it all the time, and it simple interface helps me keep peace of mind.

Superdrive-

The optical drive included with the new MacBook Pro allows you to watch DVDs, listen to music, burn DVDs, and burn CDs. It is a slot-loading drive, so the disks slide magically in and out of the computer's right side. There are no drawers to break off. Note - The drive does *not* burn dual layer DVDs.

Front Row Experience - Apple has included a new software title that at this time is only available on the iMac, Mac Mini, and MacBook Pro. Front Row. Front Row comes with your MacBook Pro, and a remote control is also included. Front row allows you to watch and listen to media items, on your computer, from across the room. Click one button on the remote, and bring up Front Row, for quick access to your music, movies, podcasts, DVD, and more. I like this feature, but I wonder how useful it is, since I'm usually sitting right in front of the computer and can just use a mouse, to access this content.

PowerPC Applications on Intel Machine

If you own a lot of software for Mac, then most of it is probably compiled for PowerPC. Developers are working hard to make titles run natively on both Intel and PowerPC, but many titles are not yet ready. However, many titles you can use on an Intel Mac because Apple has included Rosetta, which translates the PowerPC code into something the Intel machine can read. However, you never see Rosetta for it works quietly in the background and makes running PowerPC applications seamless. Microsoft Office, for example, works perfect under Rosetta. Intensive applications such as Photoshop will run under Rosetta, but it will be slower until Adobe has an Intel compiled version of Photoshop. Rosetta does work and if you add memory to your iMac, you may find such application somewhat equal to how it would perform on a 1GHZ PowerPC G4, from my experience.

Two titles I use EyeTV and Toast 7 are not yet compiled for Intel, but they run fine on my Intel Mac, under Rosetta. Again, you don't have to open anything special to use Rosetta. Your Mac knows when it needs it and uses it.

Wireless- The MacBook Pro can still connect wirelessly to networks using its included Airport Card. Furthermore, it features a Bluetooth module to connect wirelessly to devices.

Design - This MacBook Pro is beautiful, and you notice the quality as soon as you begin to open the box. It is packaged with care, in beautiful packaging. The MacBook Pro is thin, and the display is beautiful. The Mag Safe Power Connector is another amazing design feature on this machine. If someone or something pulls on the power cord connected to your notebook, instead of the notebook flying, the magnet on the connector releases, leaving your MacBook Pro safe.

Overall, I am very excited about the MacBook Pro. It is incredibly fast on Intel-native applications, and it does a very good job running PowerPC applications. If you're upgrading from a G4 Mac like myself, this machine will seem to fly. If you're upgrading from a G5 based Mac, it will be faster on native applications, but the increase in performance will be less significant to you. The Intel machines are the future of Apple, so there is no question this is a good machine, and it is powerful enough to be a good computer, for quite some time. I'm happy with my purchase, and I look forward to continue exploring my Intel Mac in the coming days
OK, my new MacBook Pro is nice. It's fast. It's not a PC. It doesn't feel cheap like most PC laptops. My configuration is same as the item sold here, but with 1GB RAM.

The MacBook isn't THAT great. It's even worse than the PowerBook from a truly usability standpoint. Here's the inherent problems that are not Mac or PC related, just lousy engineering standpoint:

1. External audio input jack does not work with normal headsets. It is not a microphone jack, but a "line level" jack, which means it works with my stereo, but not with non-powered headsets like the ones you are likely to already have for chatting on VOIP or webcasts. This is ridiculous, as it would be a piece of cake for Apple to add another mic-in jack or, better yet, make this jack compatible with unpowered microphones.

2. Bluetooth doesn't work with the bluetooth telephone headsets I've tried. These same headsets work fine with an IBM laptop that have built-in BT. There is no technical reason for the headset to not work, it just doesn't, so it's lousy engineering and/or programming.

3. There is no S-Video or RCA video output, so no way to connect it to anything but an external computer monitor. The PowerBook had this. Again, shame on you Apple for not anticipating the need to output to something besides a computer monitor with a laptop.

4. NO MODEM ! This is ABSOLUTELY ridiculous. Now I know that everyone in Cupertino has access to T3 broadband in there RangeRovers, but out in the rest of the world MOST people only have access to analog phone lines. SHAME ON YOU Apple for not putting a modem on a MOBILE COMPUTER, a computer that is MOST likely to go places where there is no broadband. PowerBook had this.

5. No PCMCIA/PCCARD slot. Huh? It has some other slot that nobody has heard of.

6. MacOSX is cool, but there are some things that aren't that great. Help is awful. For example, there is nowhere in help that tells you that a normal headset microphone won't work, so you spend a long time digging through technical specifications or searching forums to find out on your own. Something else that help didn't help with is figuring out how to get the sound input from the audio-in port to come out the built-in speakers (strangely enough, this is EASIER to do on a PC, unless I am just  ignorant and don't know the "trick" to make this happen on a Mac).

7. The screen opens to only about 115 degrees (just past perpendicular to keyboard), which is not enough for when the LAPtop is on your LAP. It should open to at least 180 degrees, or better yet 360 to let you look straight down at it for when it is at a lower position than when you are sitting in front of a high tabletop. Again, most PC laptops do open well past 90 degrees.

So, without the built-in features that should be mandatory on a laptop, this expensive laptop is basically a small desktop, but without all the expansion capabilities that a desktop has. The old G4 PowerBook is a better package than the MacBook Pro, but the MacBook is faster. As an example of Apple's "excellent" design and engineering, this laptop is a flop, ESPECIALLY for $2k.

If this computer hadn't been supplied by my employer, I would have gone with a G4 PowerBook or a supremely equipped PC for about half the price. This is my first Mac laptop, and I am disappointed.

--John
Where do I begin?! I have never owned a laptop, least of all an Apple. The last Apple I saw was when I was a kid, playing games in school on floppy disks. Since then, Apple has come a long, LONG way.

MAC OS vs. WINDOWS

Many people find that than Windows. Others don't want to take the time to figure itusing Mac OS X (in place of Windows) is actually not any more difficult  out. Well, I gave it a shot, and I didn't even have to read the directions to play around and figure it out. There is even a tiny camera built in to the laptop so that you can take pictures. You can even deform your face or change the style on the laptop for some seriously amusing photos! (For those of you who amuse easy--like me)But hey, if you absolutely don't like Mac OS X, then the MacBook Pro can run windows as well! And no, downloading windows does NOT interfere with Mac OS. Grab a copy of Windows XP Full Edition, and then go to Boot Camp Beta and they show you in visual, easy baby steps how to put windows on the MBP. This comes in handy!

SPEED

I know there are faster laptops out there, but man, who needs one to go faster than this right now? I have tested this laptop on every available ISP. Cable/DSL runs wonderful, and all it takes is one little ethernet cord to get goin'! Wireless runs just as quickly--POP! It's there! Modem (gasp! The old phone cord way) runs quickly too, although that will depend on your service. AOL is okay, but since that ISP gets overloaded with users, you tend to get disconnected. Word to the wise: If you use this old method of getting online, DON'T pay 23.90 for something that kicks you off! Sometimes cheaper really IS better!! I used PeoplePc and it was fine (Download Firefox instead of using Explorer, trust me).

Anyway...

VIEWING/AUDIO QUALITY

Wonderful!! I can watch DVDs, stream videos, and listen to music better then anything! The speakers on this are bigger, the screen is crisp, and the fluidity of the sound and video are flawless. It's safe to say this quality is compareable to the Sony Vaio. Burning CDs and DVDs is child's play, not to mention fast.

MEMORY

The memory is plenty for me. Download music, videos, etc. It depends on what you intend to do. That's all I can say about that.

PERKS

It's Stupid-Proof! Plug in your charger and don't worry about the cord getting tripped on! For instance, I didn't think that feature was a big deal, but that was before a toddler and a dog tripped over it in the first day. Instead of the laptop crashing to the floor, the magnetic cord popped out safely. Awesome! Also, instead of the cd/dvd drive having a sliding tray, the cd or dvd just pops right into the laptop, so that there is no chance of breaking off a tray and having to buy a whole new laptop! And another thing--this is just heresay, so don't quote me...yet--but I hear that Apples don't get viruses as easy as windows. Also, this thing weighs only about 5.8 pounds, making it easy for a lightweight like me to tote it around!

So, I think I hit the points that made me attracted to this computer. I haven't found something that I don't like yet. Except maybe, the fact that I am still getting used to a trackpad. But...I cheated and bought a non-rolling mouse. Well,hey, I guess you can't teach an old dog EVERY new trick! ;)
Mac Book Pro Review

Okay, so as I write this review, I am using my awesomely cool new Apple MacBook Pro.

I've only had it for 3 days though, so I'm not sure if I've been getting the best performance out of it yet. But so far its been great, with only a couple of kinks.

In this review I'll go over the main things that most of you all would like to know about. It won't all be overly detailed, because then it will be too drawn out and long, and I don't like to drawn out and long reviews.

Okay first up, the over all look, and feel:

If you've experienced Apple products in the past, you know what I'm talk'n bout when I say that this piece of hardware is THE ABSOLUTE BEST! Its so cool, I mean when you whip this thang out at school, work, or in the airport (I travel bunches). You won't believe how many people stop by and are like "Is that an Apple? I didn't know they were THAT cool. I'm gonna go and have to get me one of those!" After I've heard that a number of times I know that I've done my job for Apple as a spokesperson (seriously, I should like take over the Apple company or something). The MacBook Pro has a 15.4 display and it is bright, and I mean super bright. It's so crisp and clear you'll  think your on your imac or something.

The MacBook Pro is definitely thin. When its closed its super small. It's just a little bit heavier than I thought it would be but thats just because I moved to this from and iBook G4.

And in saying that I come to think of its speed:

Whoa is this thing fast! Compared to my iBook it definitely is. I have only been running Universal Applications though, so I can't say that things might not slow down a bit in Rosetta. I know that I will be adding more RAM in about 5 months or so, because my job includes making lots of videos, using iTunes, burning bunches of CD's and DVD's.

Let's see, hmmm, ahh yes, the little magsafe power connecter. It's pretty cool, nothing to write home about though. It did do it's job when I almost smashed my MacBook Pro onto the horrible floor of death. I was pretty relieved when I realized that I had Magsafe by my side.

Battery Life:  The first day I used my MacBook Pro without the power cord attached I only got about 2:30, now that is not very long at all. BUT, I did what the manual said and calibrated my battery, now  battery life lasts about 3 and a half hours, now thats much much better if you ask me!

Oh! I almost forgot! The most important thing, I can't even tell that there are INTEL PROCESSORS in the MacBook. It still looks, feels and runs completely like a Mac.

Now here comes the bad part of the review, yes the cons. No I don't like them either, but no laptop is absolutely PERFECT, not even in Apple:

1. When I insert a CD or DVD into my optical drive man does it make this horrible noise, now I know my ibook made a noise, but it wasn't near as bad as this. I'm gonna get this checked out soon though.

2. As I am writing this, my MacBook Pro is like hot, not warm, but hot! Now I know this is normal because it is so thin, but I don't want thighs with my MacBook Pro imprint on them this summer, but as a girl on the go, and a hard core traveler, I know I have to accept this.

3. Sometimes, for about a minute every once and a while there is this hissing noise, but its very faint and you will only notice it if your in a very quiet room with only the crickets going at it.

4. Since the MacBook Pro is a lot thinner than my previous iBook, they had to downsize the so it dosen't burn CD's any faster than my iBook.

All of these things are minor and are sure to be fixed with a firmware update. Until then, I can manage.

My last and final words are just that this is such a wonderful laptop. I am so happy that I recieved one of

these. It has been so much fun so far.

A few things that I recommend purchasing with your MacBook Pro are:

1. A nice sleeve for your MacBook Pro so that you can through it in your bag without worrying about getting it all scratched up : booqbags.com  the Vyper M2 Sleeve is a good one.

2. A keyboard cover (you have to protect your investment!) iskin.com

3. Apple Care because you never know what could happen to it! apple.com

4. A .Mac account so that you can do all sorts of stuff with iWeb (believe me it's so cool) apple.com

And thats pretty much all that I can think of!

Hope this review helped, go out and get one!
We just replaced a Dell notebook and desktop with a MacBook Pro and iMac.  OS X is just amazing, and I can't believe that Apple hasn't stolen more market share.

The iMac is perfect.  The MacBook Pro has a few quirks to be aware of:

1.  When the CPU is idle and the MacBook Pro is on battery, there is a medium to high pitch sound that emits from the computer.  This drove me crazy the first two days, but now I don't notice it as much.  Apple will hopefully fix this soon via a firmware update.  In the meantime, there is an easy workaround:  launch and minimize Photo Booth, and it consumes just enough CPU to make the sound go away.  Also, the sound seems to disappear about 90% when on A/C instead of battery.

2.  The MacBook Pro gets very hot when plugged in.  It won't burn you, but it is surprisingly hot.  You probably won't want to put it on your lap.

3.  The MacBook Pro is heavy, relative to ultra portables.

4.  The keyboard is hard to get used to for Windows switchers.  It takes two keystrokes to do things like DEL, HOME, END, etc.  The iMac keyboard is easier.

For reasons 2 and 3, consider this a "portable" and not a "laptop."

Despite these issues, this is the best portable computer I have ever owned, primarily due to OS X and .Mac.

Also - my first reaction was that I might have trouble getting used to the wide screen and how low it goes.  Nope - it is a pleasure to work with.

For Windows switchers -- expect a frustrating first day but also lots of smiles how everything just works first try.

Overall, I would highly recommend the MacBook Pro to anyone not needing an ultra lightweight portable.
I am a web developer.  I have the MacBookPro 1.83 ghz model.  I have Photoshop CS, Dreamweaver 8, Flash MX, MS Office 2004, and more installed on this thing and it hasn't missed a beat!

I have read about issues with some of the professional software such as Photoshop and Dreamweaver not being as fast on the new intel chip.  I was a little concerned about that, so I installed an extra 1gb of ram so I have 1.5 gb now.  Though I am not doing any crazy photoshop work, I don't notice a thing.  Dreamweaver runs great also!  Fireworks is a bit slow, but I am also running an older version.  Microsoft Office is fast.  I run most of these at once and have no issues at all!

I also like the battery life.  It blows my hp laptop I had away.  If you like Macs, you'll like this.  The only issue I have had is that is can run fairly hot sometimes when it is cranking out my work all day long.  I bought an iLap for it and the heat is pulled away pretty good.

Bottom line, this is a great laptop.  I am a user who runs this thing for at least 8 hours a day, with multiple professional apps running at once and it just keeps on cranking out as it should.  Oh, it is very quiet too!
I've been using the 1.83 MacBook for about a month now.  I'm a demanding user and I love it!

Screen = really nice

Performance = outstanding

Battery life = decent

Wireless reception = very good

Heat = minor

Remote = very handy

My only complaints:

Needs much more than 512 RAM...be sure to upgrade.

Screen doesn't close as tightly with base as I'd like
Most people here are rating the software shortcomings of any program running thru Rosetta. Of course these programs will run slowly. It's running thru an emulator. I don't think it's fair to rate the program and not the laptop at hand. The MacBook Pro is the single most capabale machine, laptop or otherwise on the face of the planet. Wow, right?! Well think of what it offers you and I think youll agree. This is the only machine none to man that can natively boot WIndows AND Mac's OSX. This is a huge step for us consumers and something that is being shadowed by a few of the programs that have not been ported to run on the Intel driven Mac yet.

So, take all the things the MBP offers right now, even with its short comings in Rosetta and I think if you are edcuated you will find that it's true. This is the most versitale machine on the market. Apple offering us BootCamp is an amazing advancement. Why ANYONE spending 2000 US dollars wouldnt get this machine would be a mystery to me. Everyday the number of programs left that haven't been ported to run on the MBP without Rosetta, is getting smaller. The video quality is top-notch. The speed at which this machine handles 4 or 5 programs at once is nothing short of amazing! It's light, it runs for almost 3 hours on it's battery( with settings on the processor at low, and screen at 75% brightness and with a mouse being used in the USB port.), it runs cooler by 15 degrees than my 15" PowerBook did on average doing the same work, its made like a work of art as all Apple products are.

And one very important thing to remember about anything Apple is this; if at anytime during the waranty period you have problems you will experience top-notch customer service via AppleCare. In my experinces with AppleCare, I found them eager to get to the bottom of the issue, quick to offer advice and/or referals to someone who can. If you Google "AppleCare reviews" you will see thta many esteemed PC magazines have found that consumers have rated Apple's customer service above all others. This includes the well known Dell. APple tops them all and with good reason. They want you to buy and enjoy your Apple product. They try much harder than any other company I have ever seen. Perhaps because they have always been the underdog so to speak.

Bottom line is this machine is 98% flawless. The 2% is for the few things you cant do with Rosetta and its speed. But srriously concerning yourself with this one short coming and not seeing all that this machine will afford you is silly. There are a whole list of things it does better than any other. Why get hung up on something that is not only not a big deal, but also something that is being fixed as we speak and in 6 months will be completely remedied.

Go get this machine, pronto and see what all the fuss is about. You won't believe it, you really wont. And talk about computer envy! EVERYONE will stop and ask you all kinds of questions about it and tell you how beautiful it is. Imagine anyone saying that about ANY laptop running only WIndows. Imagine.
I've always been a die-hard Apple fan, but my frustration builds as once again  their latest and greatest, isn't. For "the fastest Apple notebook ever" the Macbook Pro sure is slow. I realize that the 2.0 Duo Core is technically the faster of the models, but in comparison to my previous and unesteemed iBook, my 1.87 Ghz MacBook Pro is an operational dinosaur vis a vis the Rosetta Stone software. While Apple claims that this Rosetta tripe "just works," I have to add, "it just barely works." It can't seem to run just two programs at the same time (Microsoft Office 2004 and Keynote). I about threw the laptop out the window after my last presentation, which required both programs at the same time. Even though nothing else was running, it kept freezing, being SUPER slow or intermittantly giving me that darned kaliedescope/ lolly-pop/ busy icon for no apparent reason. It wasn't much of a sales-pitch for Apple for the people around either.

  For $500-$750 more than the price of PC Core-Duo models, I'm not really sure what you're getting except the Apple name and some nice, but non-essential features. The MacBook Pro doesn't even come with a basic word processing program! Maybe there will be some awesome Intel-Native software out there in the future that actually works, but in the meantime, hold onto your Powerbooks and iBooks. Apple has done better in the past and they need to bump it up in the future. If you are thinking about a Mac laptop wait until the 2nd or 3rd generation of Intel-based ones come out. This will save you money, frustration and give the over-sellers at Apple some time to think, work out the bugs and develop and bundle some real software with the computer.
Ok, so I'm a newbie to Apple stuff, having cut my teeth on IBM PC1 back in the dark ages with DOS. Bought a MacBook Pro; used Boot Camp to install WinXP; installed Dragon Naturally Speaking 8. Have not received my 1Gb RAM yet so I was running on 512. Left my favorite Sennheiser microphone at the office (*Duh*), so I had to use my old Andrea stand-by 'mike,' but....

Dragon literally flies on MacBook Pro. Installation was slick.  Everything worked as planned. I dictated normally, and DNS was very accurate. Then I started dictating faster, with longer, more complicated paragraphs, and it did very well -- in fact, extremely well (this is just with the quick ten-minute training session and without allowing DNS to scour my emails/documents to learn my style). Ok, so it missed 'egregious' and gave me 'courageous' -- so big whoop. My wife was amazed at how accurate and fast it was. Even my son, the technogeek, was impressed -- and nothing I do in his tech-savvy life impresses him. Actually, the MacBook was more his idea than mine -- we just decided to try it with DNS for the heck of it.

I have been using Dragon for years, and I currently run it on a Thinkpad Centrino and a dual core Intel PC, and I can honestly say Dragon on the MacBook runs better, faster and more accurately than it does on either of my other machines -- and I was getting good results with them. I have to say I was very skeptical that the MacBook would come close to my other machines, but I was wrong. I realize my testing is subjective without hard, empirical data to back up my claims, but I don't care -- I'm going with the MacBook for now b/c I have a feeling it's going to save me a lot of time, blood, sweat and tears.

The MacBook is an extremely sexy machine, and it has so many cool features on the Mac side that Windows simply can't match. I know we MS junkies are all waiting for Vista to salvage Windows (and Bill's $$$ advantage over Warren), but IMHO it's simply going to be a quasi knock-off of OSX. By then, Apple's OS will be even further ahead. I wish I could say good bye to Windows, but unfortunately, almost all of my work has to be done with a PC b/c very little software that I am 'forced' to use is written for Apple machines. Fortunately, at least I'll be able to dictate using my MacBook running WinXP and DNS.

At any rate, if any of you wonder if the MacBook and DNS (running under XP) might be a good marriage, I'd say yes. I'll do some more testing when I get the other stick of RAM and my favorite microphone installed and get DNS up to speed with all my documents. I know $2000 is a lot to pay for a laptop when you can do it much more cheaply, but I have to say I'm very satisfied so far from what I've seen.

Have not heard the 'high-pitched' whine/hiss others report, but I only got it yesterday.  Hope I can slide by that one....
I have had my MacBook Pro for two or three weeks now, and I just started hearing this terrible noise, sounds like my disk drive is grinding its teeth.  I upgraded the firm ware as well as a general OS update, the problem remains.  On the web people are suggesting turning on this little widget or turning off that little program (or throttle the CPU)....YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME!  I paid over two thousand dollars for this machine.  My biggest concern is not hurting Apple's feelings, my concern is that I bought this machine because I needed to get work done in a short amount of time, and now this??  I should have known better, considering all the unreal hype surrounding this laptop (or anything apple for that matter).  The noise is bad enough that it is distracting.  Since the first day the area under the left wrist gets hot enough that it is uncomfortable to have my had touch the computer.  The left speaker gets hot enough that I would certainly get a burn mark if I put my hand on it for a while.

My previous machine was....an E-Machine!  It was ugly, heavy and after three years of ownership, getting slow.  Now a couple of weeks into my expensive apple purchase, I have to deal with ths crap machine.  None of the reviews I have read mentioned this.  I'm just sickened by the machine, the company, and, frankly, the apple zealots.
I just received my new 17" MacBook Pro. I was a bit reluctant to replace my totally worn out PB 15 Titanium which is over 4 years ago: dings, replaced frames, and other maladies from falls, travel, etc. "Reluctant" due to the new operating system, new chips, new about everything. And then there's the issue of a ton of gigabytes and programs moved over to a new machine. Geez. What's that... days of adjustment, reloading, re-installing, and finding serial numbers.

Before that though, the experience of taking it from its box was remarkable. Who else but Apple would think about the slick box that it comes in? But the accessory box was missing... or was it. The cable adapters were there, a cool remote control (that works with Keynote), and a tight little kit of DVDs and DVD-sized books. That was it. Of course, I didn't read anything... I'm too impatient.

So, that takes me to set-up etc. I started it up, it asked if I had a Mac and would I like to migrate my files (and applications). I said yes. It demanded a Firewire cable for the deed, I complied [not provided, but I had one]. About an hour later, I had a fully operational MacBook with all of my old applications working. No dragging, serial number stuff, or otherwise (so far, that is). A seamless transition. I did need to state that my music would be authorized on the new computer. The easiest move ever. As though I was using my old computer with everything intact, but now a new, wide screen, ultrafast environment. So a little over an hour after taking it out of the box, I was using Creative Suite and other apps with abandon.

I don't want to discuss all the enhancements and how well they work since better reviewers than I have already done so. But I will do a few highlights. First, the wide screen is real estate I sorely needed (and no twisting that might cause the battery to drop out), not too heavy, but real estate and bright. It rests for hours on my leg and I fell no excess heat. The new magnetic charger connection is great: as you approach the plug it literally is sucked into the connection. And the lighted keyboard for dark room users -- awesome.

So far, all of my applications work except Virtual PC which I anticipated. I did need to trash the try-out Microsoft suite since my licensed version was co-installed (and doubling clicking took me to the try-out version rather than my version).

I haven't tried the emulation via Boot Camp, but perhaps the Parallels Virtual System might be better. The latter offers simultaneous operation. I have no choice since an important testing system is PC only, and we use it for 1000 students year.

As we would all expect, everything moves so totally quickly, that I have few barriers to productivity. And that was an initial fear. So this is a brief review focussed more on migration and seamless operation. In these respects, I could not be happier. It's a Mac, in spite of the Intel processor, with all the usual simplicities and convenience. Other barriers to productivity? I haven't found them yet.
Best computer someone could ask for! it certainly gets the job done. totally worth it
Great service, just as advertised but better
I love it. It's definitely different, it came damaged but the way it looks like it was from the mail person. It works!  Thanks again.
The item was misrepresented as being new in the ad when recived it it was used and damaged so I sent it back.
Nice clear large screen easy viewing, however running on battery power only, sucks, easy to use.
Looks perfect and performs great. Pacific Macs was extremely helpful and reliable. I would recommend them to anyone, and would gladly buy from them again in the future.
I received my Apple MacBook Pro 17" laptop. I've owned one of these Laptops before, and this one is in excellent shape. It came in its original packaging. The outer case was in perfect shape, it had no scratches. Open it up and the screen had no dead pixels, the keyboard had no dead keys. I would highly recommend this vendor.
Only flaw is that the screenis kind of loos, it tend to close if i walk or move it while open.
From Apple Tech Specs:

"17-inch (diagonal) TFT display, support for millions of colors; optional glossy widescreen display"

Translation:

Supplied LCD cannot display the "supported" millions of colors.

The screen has 1,764,000 pixels.  But can only display 262,144 different colors!

8 bit (16,777,216 colors) display technology has been the standard for over a decade.  This product is not acceptable for use by photographers or graphics professionals.

Another dirty secret is that Apple's Boot Camp beta expires and you'll have to purchase a new OS from Apple to get your boot camp back.  With Apple's track record they'll probably blame it on an accounting standard...
I bought the MacBook Pro last November when a prospective employer gave me the mandate of "learn more about Unix".  The fabled Unix roots of Mac OS X, I supposed, would give me an introduction to Unix while offering me a GUI, so I could get my "real work" done.  I originally planned to dual-boot Windows on my new Mac, using OS X occasionally until I could wean myself away from Windows.

However, weaning myself away from Windows took no time at all.  OS X puts much less strain on system resources to accomplish the same tasks.  Users can run 15-20 different major tasks simultaneously without noticing a great deal of lag, unlike on Windows.  The MBP's fans also default to a low 2000rpm and rarely step over that mark in OS X, which isn't feasible under Windows.

OS X greatly simplifies computing, in addition to making it more reliable.  The GUI is cleaned up, with power-user settings moved to the Terminal interface.  OS X's command shell (Bash) allows you to actually get things done easily -- not true of the standard Windows shell.  OS X does pretty much everything involving graphics better than Windows, because it's had the video-card reliance that Vista is "learning" built into it since 2000.  Graphics effects are faster, nicer-looking, and less intensive.

OS X alone is reason to buy the MBP, particularly with the resource-hogging Windows Vista now your only option in the PC market.  Mac hardware, however, is also first-rate.  The MBP features native Bluetooth EDR+2.0, 802.11a/b/g/n (draft), 1000 BaseT Ethernet, and a standard "SuperDrive" for CD/DVD burning.  The display quality is amazing, and hardware features like keyboard backlighting make the MBP stand out in the crowd.  The sound on the MBP is also of good fidelity for notebook speakers, though it's not as loud as many.

The MacBook Pro, like OS X, is simply beautiful in addition to highly useful.  The finish is very scratch resistant (I haven't managed to scratch it in three months of heavy everyday use, and my matte black Inspiron looked terrible in the same timeframe).

With early heat problems now apparently solved, MacBook Pro is an engineering mastery that will someday be worthy of its own museum pedestal, much like the Apple hardware that preceded it.
As I sat down to write this, I was rummaging through my vocabulary to adequately describe this marvelous computer. All the stock phrases seem inadequate. The display is sharp, intense, and glorious. The processor(s) are lighting fast; the super drive outstanding; the design a marvel. The thing is amazingly quiet, and all this stuff about heat is simply way overblown - okay, it gets pretty warm, but that's not "scalding." Can you tell I love it? And that's just the hardware - what is equally as impressive is the suite of software that comes with the machine, beginning with the OS X "Tiger" OS. It's the stuff that never gets mentioned in that "top product review magazine"; they evaluate things from a WinTel standard. Tiger, the iLife suite, and the ancilarry programs are dynamite, and their value must be in the $400 - $700 range. No, the MacBook Pro does not come cheap ... but it's worth, as the clich goes, every penny.
I  got my macbook pro 4 month ago. I realy like the design which is realy simple. I was  impressed with the keyboard which get lighted when you turn off the room light. I used this Computer to Cut My documentary film,It was stable, fast and reliable. I also installed Windows XP on it and face no problem at all. One of the best thing that apple did is that they installed 1 gb ram in one slot, which enable you to upgrade to 2 GB of ram with ease. All in all, I will recommend this powerful machine to those who want to step forward in digital video and audio.

I love this computer!  It has a huge screen for a laptop, looks great & is super fast.  I've never used a Mac before but I had it up & running in less than an hour!  So much easier to use than a PC.  Anyone who is afraid to try a Mac--don't worry.  The transition is seamless.

Highly recommend!
When Apple upgraded this 2.16GHz powerhouse laptop to 2.33GHz it dropped the price a thousand dollars. Suddenly what one reviewer here discribed as the "Cadillac of laptops" could be had for the price of a Chevy.

The great thing is-this is still a Cadillac! It roars! My experience with the iMac 24 convinced me to dump my nearly new Toshiba Satellite M65-S821 for a MacBook Pro. Being used to 17-in widescreens made this Mac the obvious solution.

I waited three weeks before submitting this review just to see if it had any annoying habits. My biggest complaint is that other lawyers and court reporters seem to be suffering from Mac-envy everytime I haul it out in a deposition. In addition to being fast and bright and ergonomically correct, the brushed aluminum case is drop-dead gorgeous with thin crisp lines that look like a supermodel at a photo-shoot.

As to software, I loaded it with Office 2004 for Mac and haven't found any Windows-only application I can't live without. Now something like OneNote, a greatly under-rated program Microsoft offers to PC laptop users, would be nice. But I have found Word templates that have the same look and feel in Office 2004 for Mac.

Now all I need to make me completely happy is a MacBook Pro tablet! Are you listening in Cupertino?
I bought this new and have had a tough time with it largely in part because I uploaded a back up software called "Bounceback Express" for my portable external storage hard drive. It is software that comes with most external hard drives made bu SEAGATE and SMARTDISK. DO NOT put this software into your mac it is like a virus and can scramble the keyboard and slow down the machine immensely.

I sent my MacBook Pro back to apple twice and they gutted, but could not figure out the problem until recently. Great customer service through Apple and it is in no way their fault.

Also, it is very important you make sure you get the new battery after the 2006 Sony recall. The warranty is great though for a year so they will replace it free if it is faulty.

I would definately get the memory upgrade. All in all I would buy it again and I am happy to be done with that evil Bounceback express software.
I've used both the black 13" MacBook and now have the 17" MacBook Pro. I'll list the pros and cons of the 17" Pro.

Pros

1. ENORMOUS SCREEN - I literally have two desktop computers at home that have smaller screens!

2. Built in iSight - Convenient

3. MagSafe Connector - innovative, especially around clumsy people and children

4. Duo core processor - The power doesn't show up unless you're doing intensive graphics work or programming

5. Keys that light up in the dark - Even though I can type without looking at the keys, it's great when you're on the train and can find the function key

6. Bluetooth - for obvious reasons

7. Firewire 800 - for obvious reasons

Cons

1. Probably the biggest is the surprising amount of defects and poor customer support for their products. I get my computers from my job and we got them as soon as they were available. That might have been a mistake, as we ran into a number of defects, including the infamous mac shutdown problem. Just do a search for "random mac shutdown" on google to see he horror. Someone even filmed their problem and showed it on youtube. I won't go through the other defects other than to say I wouldn't DREAM of getting a MacBook/Pro without getting an extended warranty. As others have also mentioned, the turn around time for them to fix your product is VERY slow, and we should have preferntial treatment with them, considering we do work for them (won't go into further details on that). Ultimately, if Apple realizes they've put out a defective product, the solution (especially on a $3000 laptop) would be to send out the white macbook as a loaner while they waited for parts to arrive.

2. Probably not the most conducive for the train. I got this laptop simply because I had the option to. If you travel a lot, you'd probably be better off with a 13" MacBook as opposed to this. If you're on a plane or train, you'll quickly realize just how big this laptop is. However, since there's no way to make a 17" also small at the same time, just note what I'm saying. Sometimes it's great that the screen is so huge. Sometimes it's slightly inconvenient.

4. The placement of the keys. This might also be due to the large size, but there is a lot of space between the keyboard and the mouse area. I initally found my wrists resting on this area and it was starting to cause me pain. I therefore now have to type with my wrists slightly elevated to avoid resting my hands on an area that simply would not be there on a smaller laptop. The only solution to this problem would be to move the keyboard forward.

As a final note, unless you're doing extensive graphics work, my opinion is that you'll get more bang for the buck by getting the black 13" MacBook. The speed difference between the Pro and the MacBook is 0.16 MHz, basically negligible. In my case, I hook up the laptop to a 23" screen at work, so only when I'm on the road is the size of the screen even an issue anyway. And again, if you're not doing extensive graphics work, I'd say it's not worth it. For half the price, you can get more bang for the buck.
Overall I am happy with the MacBookPro.  Lots of positives.  Problems include 1)too hot to handle, uncomfortably hot when used as a laptop.

2)Kept shutting down after a few minutes of battery use.  I took it to the Apple store and a new battery seem to have solve the problem. 3)The lid/screen is slightly warped, this is more cosmetic.

I bought this notebook in March 2006.  I believe that I bought too early.

I have an Imac which is awesome, and receives an A+.
This is really a great prdouct from Apple. It's fast and beautiful ! I love my MacBook Pro.

It allows you to run Microsoft Windows too !
Great design, fast processor and a fantastic OS.

I used to be a road warrior, so I had never seriously considered getting a 17-inch laptop. Now that my job has changed, I spend more time at home, so I took the plunge and got a 17-inch Mac Book Pro. It is the best machine I've ever used. As a developer, I really love the extra screen space. I was always trying to cram more windows into the limited space on my old desktop. Now, I have screen real estate to spare.

The screen is very bright and clear. The built-in speakers sound much much better than my previous laptop. The keyboard is comfortable. It has plenty of the right kinds of ports.

The machine is a little heavy and large if you're dragging it around all the time, but for limited travel, it is great. Maybe next time, I'll even consider a 20-inch laptop.

Now that you can run Windows on top of Mac OS with Parallels Desktop or dual-boot to Windows with Boot Camp, isn't it time to consider a Mac laptop? As a recovering PC-user, I can tell you that I'm glad I switched and I'll never switch back!
Don't buy the MacBook Pros. Here's my experience: I bought a MacBook Pro a few months ago and it was dead-on-arrival. I immediately had it replaced with my current MacBook Pro, which also turned out to be defective. I sent it in for repairs through my local Apple store to Apple's repair facility in Texas. Unfortunately for me, the defective part is the logic board (the motherboard on this notebook) and that part is on backorder, which I can only assume to be the case because of the demand for this part for other defective MacBook Pros. Apple's repair facility has had my notebook for more than four weeks now, and even after numerous phone calls to Apple's service center, I still don't have my notebook. My advice is to stay away from the MacBook Pros until Apple figures out why so many of them are unreliable (known problems include, but are not limited to, excessive heat and noise from the MacBook Pros). Just check Apple's official discussion forums and see for yourself.
My Powerbook Titanium was a great machine but it finally had to be replaced.

My Powerbook Titainum had replaced a NeXT machine, running what was basically OS X.  A big step up.

So anyway we ended up with a 17" Macbook Pro which is fine and dandy.

Some cons-

The screen slams shut on my fingers when I'm typing on the couch.  Evidently the hinge mechanism was not designed by people who wirelessly type from their couch.

The screen is gradually warping.  That leaves some colors to look non-uniform when working with the display.  Usually I don't notice it.  If you close the display then you can see a slight warping happening.

OS X seems way slower than it needs to be.  However at 1.83 gigahertz the OS has just about caught up with the horsepower!
I was scared that the 17" would be too big to lug around, but I find it's just fine.  In fact, I almost never use my new 24" Dell screen.  What a waste.  ;)
I don't know how widespread this problem is, but I just returned a new GLOSSY 17" Macbook Pro with big blotches of light and dark on its glossy screen. And I am not talking about glare or a dirty screen here. The luminance variations were bad enough that there was no way you could judge the brightness distribution subtleties of an image you were finalizing for printing, for example. This problem did not lessen with extended viewing nor did it vary much with brightness level or user viewing position. And the problem was much worse than my old Powerbook G4 and than a 15" MacBook Pro I saw at Fry's, both matte screened. If you're a serious photographer or image maker, load a solid gray desktop and be sure you are happy BEFORE purchasing glossy.

No other problems with my MBPro at all, but I returned it. Caveat emptor. Andy
For starters, things did not go well initially.  My new MacBook Pro (MBP) 17" died 6 hours into its life.  Conversations with Apple confirmed the situation, but since I had purchased my MBP at an Apple retailer (not an Apple Store), all Apple could do is schedule it in for repair, but they recommended that I return it as DOA.  I knew my local Fry's Electronics sold me the last MBP17" they had, but Fry's checked the other stores in the DFW area and found another store with several still in stock.  it was a 120 mile round trip but at least I got a brand new MBP and life has been WONDERFUL since.  I am a long time Windows user, but I also am very comfortable in the Mac environment( as well as UNIX).  I purchased Parallels Desktop for Mac (FORGET Bootcamp) and loaded in XP Pro and the various Windows apps that I knew I would need either due to lack of comparable Mac software or during the transition.  The MBP has to be experienced to be believed.  XP running in a Virtual Machine (VM Parallels Desktop) is WAY faster than native on a  1.8GHZ ATHLON/512MB machine. OSX Tiger is LIGHTYEARS ahead of XP and Leopard looks like it will leapfrog whatever Vista actually becomes.  It does take some getting use to having to use the function key + delete or home or end or pageup or page down to get the those functions in XP, but once you get the hang of it no problem.  I also got the Apple Mighty Mouse and it makes XP a LOT nicer than trying to work with a single button mouse.  I am upgrading to 2GB of Ram since OSX and XP running at the same time chews through the standard 1GB completely (11-15MB left).  Once a 7200RPM Perpendicular Recording is available from Hitachi, I will be moving up from the standard 120GB/5400RPM drive.

If you are a Windows user and want to move to the realm of the enlightened, buy a MBP and Parallels Desktop for Mac for those moments when you need a fix of XP.
After some initial teething troubles this machine finally began to exhibit the performance levels promised by Mac. With a 1 TB FW 800 drive and extra RAM this machine is capable of some impressive video production capabilities. I think it will really come into it's own with some form of outboard video accelerator like the Avid MOJO attached to handle the effects and transitions when playing out from the Final Cut timeline. The Internet options are somewhat sparse since my provider, AOL, does little support work for their Mac product. I think this will clear up once I install XP and use the dual boot system to switch over to utilize those features that XP does better. Is it worth the cost? It is cheaper than a Dell or HP configured in a similair fashion and looks cooler as well. So are you a Mac or Windows person? With this unit you can actually have a foot in both camps and not worry about the parochial mumblings that those wed to one or the other system make about one another.
I use a PC at work, and do some of my work remotely from home. When Apple came out with the duo core Intel processor, I still wasn't convinced that I could happily move to a new system. Let me tell you; it is the finest computer I have ever owned! I have this gut feeling that Apple made this dual OS move to convince PC users once and for all; this is the only computer you will ever want.

There is plenty of support out there for learning the new language of Mac, but it is amazingly easy. The first thing you must learn is that Mac is intuitive. I was prepared to go through pages of setup instructions to hook up my internet, but Mac did it all for me, no questions, no permissions, just had to enter my WEP key to enter my service provider environment. WOW!

Switching between systems? Boot, hold down the 'options' key, and choose your system. I you want to use Windows, you will need to purchase a new Windows XP SP2 single disk version; If you want Office tools, likewise, though many use the Mac version of Word and Excel.

What is hard to get used to? No 'delete' key (Mac has a 'delete' key, but it functions as a backspace) When you are in the Windows environment, you have to use mouse 'click' functions to delete things. Also, No 'home' or 'end' keys. All the above functions require 2 key-strokes on the Mac.

This is the only trouble I have found; It pales in comparison to the nightmares of Virus software, updates for security and everything else that seemed to drag my old system down. Get this computer; you will never regret it.
I bought this because I wanted a computer that my daughter would be able to learn how to use quickly and easily.  She is just learning how to use a computer and I felt - what is better than a MAC!  Great value with all the USB connections and we can multi-task and play a DVD on our road trips to Tahoe!  Great purchase for anyone.
I wanted a dedicated machine for Photoshop and general management of my photo workflow.  I made the decision for the MacBook Pro for a number of reason.  Quality, Value, Good Support, Application Support.

- Value: With my MBP I get a high speed process 2 GHz+, 2GB ram, 17 in monitor, 100 GB disk space @7500, 3 USB ports, 2 400 and 1 800 firewire port.  I priced this a comparable on Dell and a few other model and either way you slice it this will cost north of $3,000.  Whether it's a high end gaming device, whatever, it will cost you.  My MBP came in at slightly over $3,100 and that included Aperture and 3 years of support.  I dare anyone to make a case for a cheaper alternative with a PC.

- Quality: What can you say?  The heat output on this is about the same as other Intel based machines I've had.  It sounds like that is more than the traditional Mac laptops, but as far as Intel laptops go it's about the same.  All of the other cosmetic stuff is just fine.

- Application Support: There is plenty written about Photoshop CS2 running on MacTel machines and the performance issue.  I read some of the tests, and no only were they unusually taxing given typical use of PS, they were unrealistic for all but the photo pro who must process large numbers of complex batch jobs.

- Support:  I have called Apple support a few times.  Wait times were short, the staff was knowledgeable, polite, and proactive.  Same can be said for the IM tech support.
My fouth Mac.  Best one by far.

This computer is incredible, and the new intel version of Final Cut Studio flies!  Time to ditch your desktop!
Well, all I can say is that my experience with Apple and their Macbook Pro (MBP) has been a total disaster! I ordered my MBP on May 30th, and since then I've had three(!) replacements due to terrible build quality. The first MBP went back because the case was buckled above the battery, the lid didn't close properly, and it kicked out huge amounts of heat. The second MBP went back because the screen catch was broken on delivery. My third, and final MBP is about to go back because the LCD has extremely uneven illumination and the lid doesn't close properly (one side closes flush to the keyboard, whilst the opposite side has a gap of almost 0.5cm). My advice to anyone considering a MBP is to wait until they have ironed out their quality control issues. I was a Mac convert, but I might just convert back :-(
HP has the WORST customer service of any company of any kind that I have ever dealt with. I have never called without having spent at least one hour on the phone with them before the various extensions in India, none of whom are helpful. And once the service is complete the computer is usually returned with more problems than they were origionally sent with. I would never buy another HP again.
First HP does not include a backup copy of the XP software unless you buy the system directly from HP. Also HP recovery system takes up to 17 GB of hard drive space. Which deduces the stated drive space. After being passed around the HP customer service, 7 persons and five different phone numbers, I have come to the conclusion that I will never buy a HP or compaq computer even if it was the only computer aviable and it was free.
This is an incredible machine for the money.

It is fast, responsive,great graphics with just 32megs,great keyboard,excellent screen size and am very pleased with this laptop...and mine was a clearence item ( a floor model)at circuit city.

Still works great!!

AMD processors are well designed and perform effortlessly.

Plenty of ram with 1  gig.

Syed
Why settle for less, when you can get a brand new original colorful ultra-cool Sony VAIO FJ series laptop with 1GB RAM, 100GB disk, DVD writer, built-in webcam, etc. and all for Free! I got mine from this web site:  awesomestufffree.com/laptop
I bought this laptop and as soon as I got it, cleaned it up and installed my favorite Linux Distros, now I have 15GB for Windows, 7GB for Debian (my favorite) 7GB for Kubuntu (trying it out) and 1GB for a future installation of Linux From Scratch, the other 50GB are for my data.

So far everything has worked well, except in kubuntu that I had to configure a "vesa" driver to get Xorg Working, but later updated to the ATI Driver and now, everythings works Great!!!

The Only thing I miss is a PS/2 Port for an external optical mouse I have.
After owning 8-10 Thinkpads over my lifetime, when IBM gave up support and marketing of its Thinkpad line, it was time to look elsewhere for notebook technology; cheap wireless mice have replaced the red "joystick" satisfactorily.

Thank you HP!  The Turion 64 based DV8110us is fast, feature packed and quiet, much more so than a Pentium IV equipped laptop.  Also, this PC feels a whole lot faster than Centrimo  Pentium M machines I own, a Thinkpad T41 and Compaq v2135.  The 17" BrightView screen and 10-key pad make the DV8110us a great desktop replacement for my Dell XPS 4600.  The powerbrick is among the smallest made today for notebooks, comparable to the advanced Thinkpads converters.

My only complaint?  When installing software, the CD burner makes almost as much noise as an outboard motor.

No better deal than this for about $1000.
This is good one..Sleek and short. Performance is good and has a good stand by battery too.
Hey people,

  This is Arpitha and i bought this laptop a month ago and it is great......sleek,light weight,i like it........got it for a good deal and i recommend this to everyone who wants a good and wonderful laptop.

  Only drawback is that the battery gets heat up very soon so..........be careful...........
While this laptop is attractive, and the screen looks great, almost everything else about it is terrible.  Opening up a simple program  like Internet Explorer took as much as 30 seconds (when nothing else was running and the computer was clean and free from any viruses).  When I right clicked on the desktop, it took as much as 30 seconds for the menu to pop up.  My laptop recently broke for the 2nd time.  If you want an easy-to-use, quick computer, then do not buy this.
goods:

1. beautiful, realistic, and very clear screen. i own a HP laptop and i have to admit that sony's screen is clearer, more realistic, and easier on the eyes. the light is "natural" and it's simple a wonderful LCD screen.

2. design. the color combination is very pleasing and the silver VAIO logo is modern and elegant. my HP is the typical all black laptop; it's ugly compare to sony.

bads.....

1. HORRIBLE battery life.... this is a 4 cell battary.. which means the laptop needs to be recharged every 2 hours or so. THIS IS SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE. my HP's battery can last over 6 hours (it's a 6 cell) with this price level, sony should throw in a 6 cell battery. simply put, you can't even finish a movie on airplain with this laptop.

2. replacement battery is very very expensive. it runs around 150 bux.

3. the laptop runs hot. my HP laptop, after using it for a whole day is only warm. on the other hand the sony laptop is burning after about 2 hours of use. i can't even put it on my laps without using a thick book to insolate the heat after about a hour of use.

4. very limited transfer, communication ability. the sony laptop has no infared port, no SD, SC, CM or other flash memory card slots. it only accept MS cards. i found the lack of infared port troubling since i am so used to "beam" files at work. with sony, it's a no no.

5. no S-video output... i simply HATE this. with all my other computers, they all have S-video output. and i love to play some music files i downloaded from internet on tv. but i can't do it on sony coz it doesn't have a S-video port.

6. flaky wireless connection. everytime the computer goes to standby, i will have a hard time turn back the wireless connection back on. this never happened on my HP and my old dell. everything just connected automatically.

bottom line.... it's a pretty laptop to look at.. but i believe the bads out weigh the goods.
PROS:

Cheap with a Sony badge

Nice display

Plenty of them around

CONS:

Battery life is woeful! States: 3.5 - 5hrs  Really: 2hrs (at most!)

Packed full of trailware, adware, etc. WTF?

Toshiba 'starter' hard-drive is problematic: read: foo-baa'd

Gets hot, really, really quickly.

Optical drive is clunky, loud and slow.... :(

Support? What's that... :(

Verdict:

I was really looking forward to this lappy but I've realised it is not really a Sony, i.e, Made In Japan. This Chinese shocker is a pure revenue-raiser from Sony and they should know better than to put their name to this quality of product - too many bean-counters in the top jobs these days I guess. Take my advice: stay away from the Onyx model that is made in China! Hate to say it but this thing STINKS!
We bought our Sony and it looked great - imagine out disappointment when we got it home and found out it was bogged down with every imaginable piece of rubbish.

Sony won us over with gerat design - as usual - then lost us entirely with bad choices about rubbishy OEM software - they should know much better than this.

Here's an idea - offer us the OPTION of getting a clean PC - I would gladly pay extra for this.  Seriously - I have wasted two days trying to get this PC working to spec.

Is anybody else tired of this practice?
This is a great laptop with everything that i wanted. It is not very heavy as other laptops, the qaulity of camera is good. The screen size is also perfect. The only thing that is a little bit irritating is that the buttons below the touchpad are a little bit smaller as compared to thinkpad and dell . But once i get used to it everythings cool.
I always wanted a vios and this time I got one. It's my third lap top, before I had a compaq and a toshiba. The camera was fun but I and the sony guy couldn't get it to work as a web cam and the mic was handy as well. It was fast(not as fast as I wanted) and fun and looked great. I LOVED it ..."until I typed" and like the reviews of another vios from the prior one before the fj270 the keys don't only stick , if you were trying to type on a plane you'd drive people nuts. The sony guy said that unlike other keyboards it's not fully fastened down. Only one little thing on the right which does allow the left to pop and when you hit anything above cap locks the keys all move in that area. He tested all the pc's in our local store and they we're all the same... he said it's an "annoyance" and so sony probably won't care because thats not considered a defect....but if I wanted a key (click,click,click)popping computer that wasn't smooth typing I wouldn't have gotten a Sony. I wasn't expecting perfection, but atleast a smooth ride. I am let down by the quality.
(Updated April 02, 2006)

The Sony Vaio SZ-110/B (model # VGNSZ110B) is Sony's entry-level SZ-series notebook. The SZ line represents Sony's latest attempt to combine mobility and power without sacrificing too much of either. This ultraportable notebook weighs in at a light 4 pounds, about average for its category, but it comes loaded with features not found on other ultraportables.  Other notebooks in this category include the Lenovo Thinkpad X60s, the Asus W5F, and the Toshiba Portege M400 convertible tablet.  I haven't been able to try any of them, unfortunately, so this review will only be about the Sony.

General info about the Sony SZ line
------------------------------------
Sony's SZ notebooks are divided into two major categories, "Regular" (Sony just calls them "SZ", but "Regular" is used here for clarity) and Premium:

* Regular SZ notebooks have magnesium bodies, weigh 4.1 lbs, and offer a manufacturer-estimated 5.5 - 6 hours of battery life (inaccurate; see below).

* Premium SZ notebooks have carbon-fiber bodies, weigh 3.7 lbs, and offer a manufacturer-estimated 6 - 7 hours of battery life (inaccurate; see below). They use a different type of LCD screen and backlight, resulting in an ultrathin screen (4.5mm thick) that supposedly looks better than the Regular type -- but the Regular screen already seems thin enough and bright enough, so the Premium one may be more of a luxury than a necessity. The Premium notebooks also have a slightly different type of keyboard, but the difference is subjective and preference will probably depend on the individual user. Lastly, some Premium notebooks come with an integrated EDGE antenna for wireless Internet access using Cingular's cellular network.

The two types are otherwise the same.  For more details, visit [...]

The SZ-110B in particular
------------------------------------
The 110B is Sony's lowest-priced SZ notebook (excluding the custom-configurable SZ-140).

* As a Regular SZ notebook, it has a magnesium body instead of the carbon-fiber body of the Premium notebooks.

* It comes with Windows XP Home instead of Windows XP Professional.

* It has an Intel Core Duo T2400 1.83Ghz CPU instead of the 2.0Ghz CPU that some others have.

* It has a 100GB hard drive instead of the 120GB drive that some others have.

* It does not have the EDGE antenna (for WWAN Internet access) that some others have.

Pros
------------------------------------
* Very light (4 pounds).

* Runs cool under normal office and Internet usage.

* Seems well-built.  The screen is sturdy and the magnesium casing looks great and feels okay.

* Built-in dual-layer DVD writer is a rare find in an ultraportable.

* The SZ line's unique Hybrid Graphic System lets you toggle between two internal graphics cards: The Intel GMA 950 (for better battery life) and the Nvidia GeForce Go 7400 (for low-to-medium end 3D gaming).

Ultraportable Core Duo notebooks are already rare.  The Sony SZ line is unique in that it is the only ultraportable (< 4 lbs) Core Duo series to offer a gaming-capable 3D graphics card.  The 7400 is an OK gaming card: It won't run the latest and greatest very well, but it should be fine for less demanding games and older titles.

* Has both a PC Card slot (PCMCIA Type II) and an ExpressCard/34 slot, meaning the notebook can use both current- and next-generation products.

* There is an additional standalone Memory Stick Duo Pro MagicGate slot.  It's useful if you have other Sony electronics and don't want to bother with Duo-to-regular-size adapters.

* The 4-pin FireWire/IEEE 1394/iLink port (different names for the same thing) is a luxury not often found on ultraportable PC notebooks.

* Bluetooth (Sony doesn't specify the version) comes standard.

Cons
------------------------------------
* Battery life, realistically speaking, is between 2 to 3.5 hours -- a far cry from the advertised 6.  A large-capacity extended battery is available for $200 or more.

* DVD drive is relatively noisy and makes the whole system vibrate when in use.

* Awkward port layout.  The DVD drive, two USB ports and ExpressCard/34 slot are all on the right hand side.  The power plug, located on the back edge, juts out at a 90-degree angle to the right and adds to the clutter.  This is hell for right-handed external mouse users.

Additionally, the headphone and microphone jacks are in the back left corner... not exactly a convenient place.

* Only two USB ports, both are which are close together.  Bigger devices may not fit without an extension cable.

* There is only one wireless switch and it controls both WiFi and Bluetooth simultaneously.  They can be individually toggled in software, but separate hardware switches (or at least keyboard functions) would've been better.

* No TV / S-Video output and no DVI output.  There is a VGA port, however.

* No Gigabit ethernet.  A strange decision on Sony's part, but not a big deal unless you do a lot of networked file transfers.

* No infrared port, though Bluetooth somewhat negates the need for one.

* The hard drive is deep inside the notebook and cannot be swapped out/upgraded without taking apart the case and keyboard.

* No manual included.

* No software CDs included.  No Windows XP CD and not even a recovery CD.  Sony wants you to burn your own recovery set with either 8-9 CDs or 2 DVDs.  I don't like that at all.

* Machine comes extremely bloated in terms of software.  It is loaded down with trial versions of Norton security software, Trend security software, Microsoft software; redundant control applets for Bluetooth, notebook settings, WiFi configuration; redundant media players and disc burning programs, etc.

Some degree of bloat is typical, but Sony takes it to a new level.  The included software is also unintegrated and decentralized.  Combined with the lack of a printed manual, it can be hard to determine what the various programs are supposed to do.

* A clean, fully-functional reinstall of Windows XP is either extremely difficult or outright impossible with this notebook.  Sony did a very poor job of making drivers available.  Many necessary drivers are missing from the website and there are also some unnecessary drivers for devices that aren't even on the notebook.  Among the drivers that are both necessary and available, some actually refuse to install even though they were supposedly made for this system.

The recovery DVD -- which is also supposed to have the drivers -- does not work without certain support packages from the website.  However, the DVD does not tell you which packages are required.  Even when you find the right packages, some of the drivers are the DVD won't install and others are buggy and break parts of Windows (the HD shock protection driver, for example, breaks Plug and Play).

Basically, getting this notebook to work well with a fresh copy of XP is going to be difficult for the average user.  If you want to start over with a clean system, I strongly encourage you to choose another notebook or wait until Sony cleans up the drivers section.  I am very disappointed with this situation.  Note, however, that this is only relevant if you plan on reformatting and reinstalling Windows -- something that relatively few users will do.  The system works just fine out-of-the-box.

* Sony has 24x7 phone tech support, but it isn't very good.  Wait times for senior technicians during peak hours can exceed one hour.  Wait times for regular first-tier support is acceptable -- just a few minutes -- but they can't always help.

Also, Sony's extended and on-site warranty plans aren't available on Amazon.  You MAY be able to purchase one direct from Sony, but I'm not sure.  If not, any necessary warranty repairs would require mailing in the notebook and that could take a while.

* Considering the high price (nearly $2000), I would've expected Sony to use slightly better components.  The hard drive is only 5400 RPM.  The RAM is clocked at 533 Mhz, not the 667 Mhz that the motherboard supports.  The DVD drive is slow and possibly a bit picky about discs.  The webcam is a non-swiveling, low-resolution camera that's worse than some of its present-day peers.  The AC adapter power brick is slightly bigger and heavier than necessary, while the cable is shorter than usual (you may want to get an extension cord or a third-party AC adapter).

Other things
------------------------------------
* Sony includes a multi-card reader (xD/SD/MMC/MS Pro) that goes in the ExpressCard slot.  This is a nice gesture, but the reader would've been even better as a separate, standalone slot so that the ExpressCard slot can stay free.

* Fingerprint scanner is useful for security, but its placement is not optimal.  It sits right between the two touchpad buttons and is too easily activated by accident.  Sony chose the worst possible place to put it.

* The keyboard feels -- for the lack of a better term -- "different" from most other notebook keyboards.  It has big, "clicky" keys that just feel different.  It's not necessarily better or worse than what's out there: Some people like it, some people love it, and some people hate it.  If you're going to get an SZ, first try out the keyboards (both Regular and Premium) at a brick-and-mortar retail store before you buy.  Also, the keyboard can be a bit noisy when compared to others.

* The laptop's "XBRITE" screen is of the glossy variety.  It's great for watching movies or gaming in a dark room, but it can be annoying in well-lit areas if you can't find a good angle under the light to minimize the reflections.  Whether this would bother you is probably, again, a matter of personal preference and I would suggest that you compare glossy and matte screens at a retail store in order to see the difference.

Conclusion
------------------------------------
I'm generally impressed with the notebook.  It's a nice-looking, well-built machine loaded with unique features and with a very light weight to boot.  It manages to combine power and portability in a single package; it's not easy to find a machine that's both this fast and this light.

If you're looking for a powerful ultraportable, I think this would be good choice as long as you won't be doing much tinkering.  I could not find a comparable machine from any other major manufacturer at the time this review was written (late March 2006).  Overall, I would recommend this system to anyone who can live with the cons listed above.

But if you're the kind of person that likes to truly customize your computer, you might not be happy with this.  The system carries a hefty price tag for its so-so components and upgrading the parts (especially the hard drive) will be expensive and time-consuming.  My experience was marred by Sony's poor software package, its no-included-CD policy and its poor tech support quality.  The notebook simply doesn't work right with a clean Windows XP installation and Sony was of no help in solving the issue.  I'm disappointed that a company as big as Sony would be so bad at after-sales support.  Based on this experience, I would not buy another computer from Sony if any other major manufacturer offers a comparable system.  In this case, however, there weren't any similarly equipped systems.

So if you have trouble deciding, just ask yourself one question:  Would you be happy with the notebook as Sony configured it?  If so, this'd probably be a great little machine for you.  If not, if you like having more control over your system... I would stay away for the time being and wait and see how Sony addresses the issues.
I had been looking for a new laptop for probably a year; holding out for something that would be portable, powerful and stylish.  My wait was over when the SZ came out.  This notebook is amazingly fast - it is snappier than the dual core 2GB of RAM desktop I have at work!  The case is beautiful with brushed aluminum palmrests and very good build quality.  The battery life is less than the "7 hours" in the description but I easily get 3-4 hours a charge.  The bottom line is you will not find a laptop this small with dedicated graphics and this much power at any price!  Speaking of price, the only con I found (and this is amazon's fault, not sony's) is that a few days after I received it the price came down by a hundred dollars!  This works in your favor as it is an even better deal.
After I bought the laptop only for 3 weeks, so many issues happened:

1) DVD writer is not easily be used. No idea about how to use it.

2) Sony bluetooth mouse cannot be installed on the VGN-SZ110B

3) It needs to be recovered twice already !!

4) The amazon prices for the sell decreases continuesly, and make me feeling be cheated.
este computador lo compre por la reputacion que tiene sony con sus portatiles, pero presento un problema con el hardware con un ruido terrible, se bloquea frecuentemente y es menos de lo que cuesta, toshiba tiene un computador similar a un precio mucho mejor, definitivamente no recomiendo este computador.
I got my laptop a little over a month ago, and I am very pleased with it.

People seem to be complaining about 3 things: battery life, keyboard, and battery "looseness". I tested out the battery life a couple times and it goes about 4-5 hours on stamina mode, pretty great if you ask me. TO make it last longer, I take the battery out when the power supply is plugged in. Also the keyboard? I like the largeness of the keys and how it spans the whole bottom panel. I think it's great. Also the "looseness" of the battery is something I had a concern about before I bought it, but it's NOTHING to worry about! You only notice that it wiggles a tiny bit if you try hard to move it. I wouldn't have noticed it if I hadn't heard so much about it.

Other things: the integrated camera is a great feature but not as clear as my desktop webcam. The fingerprint sensor is a cool tool too, and lets you automatically sign into secure websites (to check your mail, etc) very quickly. The only downside is that it isn't compatible with my browser of choice: firefox. Also a negative is the bulky power supply. I mean, what's the point of a superlight notebook if the power supply is going to still weight you down?

A huge negative that almost made me not buy the thing is the ancient speed of the DVD burner on this notebook. I mean, it's as slow as my 3 year old desktop! However, it does have the new double-layer disc burning capability, which I haven't been able to try yet because those things are expensive right now.

All in all, if you've got the money for it, go for it! I'm very satisfied with my purchase. It's very light for the size. The display is beautiful.
I just want to touch some subjects that have been the negative points of the other reviews.
Battery IS a little bit loose, however I don't think it's to the point that you need to worry about it. It has a locking mechanism to secure the battery to the main unit.
I actually like the keyboard better than my old Sony notebook (K-series). It's light and bigger. So, contrary to the complaints in the other reviews, I actually think the keyboard is an improvement.
The notebook does come with the options of "Stamina" and "Speed" performance. So, you can easily choose "Stamina" if you are running on your battery, and switch to "Speed" otherwise. Therefore, you DO have the options to have longer battery support.
I had problem setting up my wireless connection in the beginning, and I actually had to call Linksys to get support and received tips from the technical support person. Apparently, Sony has its own wireless connection manager. So, when I just enabled this manager (and disabled windows wireless connection manager), everything runs smoothly. Go to "VAIO Support Central" in the start menu for information. I wish Sony provided at least some hints about this. But all is well now.
Other than those issues, I love this notebook!! It's light (way lighter than the K-series, so I don't have to worry about back/shoulder pain from carrying it everywhere I go). I was afraid that the screen would be too small for me, but it turned out to be okay. The AC adapter (again comparing it with the K-series) is definitely a lot smaller and lighter. I have yet to explore the (integrated) web cam feature, but I am pretty excited about it.
If you are a Sony notebook fan, you can't go wrong with this product.
Bought it last week, received it on Thursday not working by Monday, what a shame, it's my first VIAO, the notebook doesn't boot up, looks like the HD is defective, called customer service at Sony, very rude guy, conclusion: after spending almost 2 thousands in this machine and finding it defective I'm returning it  right away
I own SZ140p model for about 1 month.

Pros:

- Screen size and display quality are very nice.

- I'm happy with the embedded webcam, it is very convenient to use with a chat client.

- Lightweight, think, and sleek

Cons:

- Space key on the keyboard is really annoying. I had it replaced by Sony service but after two days it doesn't work properly again. You have to press hard. I tried several different laptops and they all have the same problem. :(

- The battery is slightly loose, and when you're carrying the laptop it feels as if it is very fragile.

- Although the harddisk is advertised as 100 GB, it shows around high 80s. It is not that important for me though.

I would strongly recommend trying the laptop out at a local store before buying it. When I did it myself, I had the impression that keyboard and loose battery problem pertain to the display model only but I was wrong.
Like others I have a few complaints but nothing serious. Most importantly is the keyboard. I'm getting used to the feel now but the space key is a problem. At least on my PC if you press either side of the space bar it doesn't respond unless you really smack it, meaning that I get a lot of words running together when I spell check. Pressing the center of the bar works fine with even light pressure.

Secondly, why only 2 USB ports? Seems like there is plenty of space for a 3rd or fourth port.

The screen is great and I like the idea of the two video cards. I usually use the nVidia mode and get prettygood battery life. Where Ireally sucks the juice is if you're playing games. In that case the performance is great but the fan is running full speed and the battery goes quick. But its nice to have the option. Even in speed mode I get 3+ hours when doing word processing/spreadsheets/email.

I purchased a SZ160P last week, and the CD/DVD drive malfunctioned on the fifth day.  It made strange noises when a CD was inserted into the drive, and could no longer burn CDs.  The hypernation mode also malfunctioned, according to the Sony technician with whom I had an extended telephone troubleshooting session. It is unfortunate that such an expensive machine does not have better quality control.  I wouldn't recommend it for that reason.  Also, the AC adaptor is quite heavy and very bulky.
I hope I have used this enough so far to warrant a review, but here I go anyways

Picked up my SZ-120 on thursday night and am just loving it......

I have the same problems as others who have commented so far, from:

- Loose battery

- Dissapointing battery life (i keep reading that its XP and USB related though, hopefully MS will release a fix)

- I also *hate* the fact you cannot easily turn off the touchpad.. i use my notebook-sized mouse and hate running my palm across the touchpad....

- "100 gig" HD actually showing 89 gigs of space to use (there is a hidden partition, but windows says its only 6 gigs, where's the other 5?)

Otherwise the Dual-Core CPU's book along and it runs all my programming stuff just fine  :-)  Definitely recommend this laptop to anyone looking for small and fast
I was on the line between choosing a Sony vaio sz120 and sz160. I'm glad I went with the 120. The main differences between the two are the material they are made from -- fibre carbon for the 160 and magnesium alloy for the 120 (ignore the fact that they describe the 120 as black carbon -- this refers to the color only), the weight -- the 160 is about a half pound lighter due to the fiber carbon, and the screen quality. The last thing made me hesitate, as the 160 screen is both thinner, and brighter than the 120s. But the 120 is still pretty darn nice, and for the price difference, it wasn't worth it to me to go with the 160.

Of cosmetic note -- the 160 model has a smooth black exterior, and the word vaio is in black. The 120 has a rough black surface, and the word vaio is in silver. I prefer the rough surface myself, as it is both less prone to scratches and fingerprint smudges.

The machine itself seems fairly solid. The battery is slightly loose, but not too bad. The built in dvd dual layer burner is a very nice new feature for someone whose last laptop didn't even have an internal drive. I was hesitant about the fingerprint reader at first, wondering about whether it was really necessary, what happened if it failed to read your fingerprint properly, etc -- but I am surprisingly taken with the feature. Specifically, the ability to use it to do fast switches between two users on the same system. You can scan multiple fingers, and if you simply can't get it to respond, you fall back to your typed-password.

The webcam, on the other hand, is a waste of space and power. It's incredibly poor quality, and because it's a usb powered camera, it runs afoul of the duo core usb-bug issue that causes your battery to drain faster than it should. Here's hoping they patch that soon.

A heads up on the battery life -- although Sony has scaled back from it's original, preposterous claims of six hour battery life, it's still overestating by a long shot. In speed mode, you'll get somewhere over two hours. In stamina, just over three.

You'll hear Sony taking a lot of grief over the keyboard on this model, and at first, I was also taken aback. I'm used to a keyboard where the keys are raised, and narrow towards the top. The keyboard on this model is almost entirely flat, and as a result the keys take up the entire space allotted to them, and are much larger than what I was used to. People have called these keys "plasticky" and "cheap" feeling, but honestly, I think it's the size that's shocking at first, and people may just be taken aback by the new style. As someone with fairly small hands, it took me about a week to ten days to adjust to the new feel. Now I'm fine with it. For someone with larger fingers, this might actually be an advantage.

My 100 gig drive shows only about 87 gigs. I'm told a good chunk has been set away in a hidden system recovery area. The machine also come pre-loaded to crap they were trying to sell you on. (AOL, Anti-spyware software), etc. I spent the first day or so just cleaning off the clutter.

The wireless seems strong, I haven't tried the bluetooth out yet, and physically, the machine is simply lovely. If you're using stamina mode, and the screen seems to dark at first, use Function+F6 to brighten things up, as going into the display management system just resulted in an overbright, washed out screen.

This may sound like a lot of critical material, but I don't regret buying the machine, and think it will serve me well, hopefully for as long as my last vaio did.
I own a VGN-S560P which I bought it in Dec '05.  I have full satifaction over that product performace and everything except the fact that the video card is partially shared.  Glad SZ series come out with fully dedicated video card.  Plus, the hybrid system to expand the battery life is just CLEVER reinvention! However, went to try at local electronics store and don't like the keyboard feel and the look of those buttons(i.e. power buttons and stuff). They just look and feel cheap.  We are paying almost $2000 here! Hello...  Love the new design and it's just a Sony!  Who can resist =)  Besides the fact that it has large Hard Drive space, ram, and DVD-burner; Built-in bluetooth, web camera, and microphone makes it more different than others. These stuff really makes me more productive and increase my capabilities that other notebooks can't.  It's worth the money with quality and capabilities that this notebook can do. I'll wait and see for awhile if Sony address these issues.  These days 256mb dedicated video card is almost a must. Expect to get SZ-160 or SZ-180 end of this year or sooner. Dang it Sony, I've to find more space to store my old notebooks in the storage which mostly used less than a year :P  Thank god it's a notebook I can just fold and stack it :D  Don't get any worst if new one ever come out again!!
After considering lenovo T60, apple macbook and toshibas I found out about this new sony laptop. It's the only laptop that allows you to switch between two graphic cards (integrated intel chip and Nvidia for performance) so user can optimizie the battery life or the performance based on their needs. Screen is great, and wireless works perfectly. With this sepcs (100gb hard/ 1gb ram/ 1.83 core duo/ 4.1lb weight) you can hardly go wrong. My only complaint is about the keyboard which is a downgrade from all the previous vaio models with big travel distance and obvious flex.  I'm not sure why Sony decided to ship this otherwise perfect model with such a crappy keyboard, although you'll eventually get used to it after a week. And this notebook looks great too and has the perfect size for traveling, and it also gives you long batter life (4+ hours in "stamina" mode). oh yeah and it comes with extras: bluetooth, integrated web cam and a good quality microphone.

in summary:

pros: weight, hard drive, ram, core duo, stylish design, bluetooth

cons: keyboard, power adapter still a bit too big, bundled software, hybrid platform makes it harder for dual boot with *nix.
If this machine weren't buggy then it would be a very good value for $999, given the DVI out capability which lets you run the machine closed with an external monitor -- AFAIK no other x86 laptop has this cool feature at anywhere near this pricepoint, plus the integrated bluetooth and videocam.

I aso like the glossy screen, especially with the PC/TV screen gamma (Apple's default gamma setting is a bit too washed out for me).

Unfortunately, after a week I've found some bugs with the MacBook:

1) Same electronic noise issue when the CPUs are idle as with the MBP (opening Photo Booth does cut out the noise substantially).

2) Machine was running very hot & (worse) was "mooing" -- the fan would come on and then go off repeatedly, making a highly annoying noise each time. This was so annoying that I disassembled the MB to see if reapplying the thermal paste (some Arctic Silver 5 that I had left over from a P4 build) correctly (apparently for some reason Apple's production plant is putting on WAY too much grease during assembly) would help. After putting everything back together, the machine is in fact a lot quieter (but no cooler, at least according to CoreDuoTemp).

3) 512MB is not enough, 1GB should be minimum, given the memory the integrated graphics eats. Get matched pairs for dual-channel is recommended, so you will have to ebay the 512MB that is in the machine when you get it (good luck!).

So ... 3 stars if you get a lemon but 4 since if the machine moos too much in the first month Amazon's liberal return policy's got you covered.
This is my third Apple computer. As an overall value, this thing is excellent. The unit is as powerful in all areas as a Macbook Pro except for 3d graphics accelleration (used in 3d gaming) for almost $1000 less. Also, this unit is lap usable as it does not get nearly as hot as the Pro model. The RAM and hard drive are in the battery compartment and VERY easy to upgrade yourself if you are so inclined. And don't get me started on the slot loading DVD drives.. why other laptop manufacturers have not stolen this idea from Apple I will never know.

In addition to awesome hardware, you will receive the OSX operating system which includes great multimedia and productivity software and tools for free. So you won't end up with a PC turned into a boat anchor from the ravages of viruses, spyware and adware. You also get iLife, Apple's suite of tools for music (iTunes, Garageband), movies (iDVD, iMovieHD) and internet publishing (iWeb).

In summary, you are getting the BMW of computers for the price of a Geo Metro.
My first Mac!  I purchased this computer (over the mac mini) on Amazon the day after it was released. I always wanted a Mac and I always wanted a laptop. The Macbook was the best solution for me and is a great second computer. I'm extremely pleased. The 13.3 inch screen is bright, glossy, and crystal clear. I love it!  I purchased apple's "mini DVI" to DVI adapter, the apple bluetooth mouse and keyboard and use this laptop (with the clam shell closed) with my Viewsonic VA1912wb 19 inch monitor when I want more screen real estate (I didn't even have to install drivers for the bluetooth mouse, bluetooth keyboard, or monitor...the computer recognized those devices and they just worked.) However, the image on the laptop itself is the best image I've ever seen on a laptop computer and way better then the image on my viewsonic flat panel monitor!  The machine is whisper quite. The airport extreme worked with my current 802.11g router. It's so cool streaming my itunes music over wifi from my PC to my macbook from any room in the house. This laptop had everything I needed right out of the box: email, web browser, word processor (text editor), along with the iLife package.  I recommend this computer to all those PC users out there (like me) who want a great little second computer and who always wanted to experience owning a Mac. Cons: No superdrive on this model and the machine gets warm on your lap.
I am thrilled with this computer.  It's my first laptop and what a kick!  I've had two Mac desktop computers and have always been a big fan of Apple computers.  The beauty and simplicity of design of may laptop is great.  The feel of the keyboard is excellent.  What can I say about OS 10.4?  If you know this system,  then you know that there is noting better!  Well, except for the upcoming 10.5, perhaps  Buy a Macbook and you won't be sorry!
Great machine for consumer use. Out of the box has lots of easy to use features.
I was a bit dissapointed it came with no word processing software other than "pages" for 30 days which is very limited
This is an amazing machine and here's why:

1. OS X(5/5): Rock solid and rarely has "issues" like its counterpart. No viruses, or spyware to speak of. Also, its more useable for average people. Two examples of this are WiFi and digital cameras. Here's my tutorial: plug in your digital camera and it will ask if you want to upload files; go to open wifi access point and, open browser. Done. Simple.

2. iLife(5/5): Has excellent useability as well: all of your media in iTunes, iMovie, iDVD, iPhoto are all interoperable and can be used together seamlessly. You will be making home movies in iMovie, grabbing a song from iTunes, and then maybe throwing in some photos from iPhoto with the greatest of ease!

3. Physical Characteristics(4/5): The 13" display is big enough to use without making the unit too big to carry around. The widescreen helps with desktop space. I will admit I'm not a fan of the white laptop but color is the least of my concerns when choosing electronics. The built in mic and camera are nice added feature for photoconferencing in iChat or Skype as well. It must be added the speakers are not very good and the other negative is no firewire 800 port/only 1 firewire 400 port. It runs a little hot but not burning hot. The keyboard is very nice as its not condensed like other laptops and typing is easy, almost like a regular keyboard.

Overall its a great machine and if you upgrade the hard drive and RAM on your own it can do most anything. Check out free apps for the mac like VLC(video), Monolingual(language remover), Limewire(filesharing) and Mac the Ripper(DVD decrypter) once you get this little gem.

UPDATE: My machine is still running great. I can run Dreamweaver, iTunes, Bittorrent and Photoshop all at once without crashes. Yes, it gets taxed a bit but its a lot better than my pc at work.
the noteboook is a damn sexy thng....evrythng is far better than windows....

and u'll definately turn eyes....the drawbacks r dat u gotta take a gudcare of this piece and thr is no dvd writer..

overall a gud buy n promt delivery...
This is a first generation MacBook post I-book genre. The logic board crashed two weeks after purchase, fortunately the Apple Genius Bar was efficient, everything got fixed within 3 days and the same problem hasn't occurred since. The common problems with the Mac laptops or I-macs are Logic Board and Battery issues. If you decide to keep it long term, absolutely purchase the extended warrantee!
It's a good purchase, good construction, good look, but is not as stable as the Power PC ones, I think It might be something about the Intel thing... I don't know but the batery is very suceptible... I think all the thing is a good computer but is not like Apple in the past...

I Miss Power PC!
I like it very much and everything of it works very well.
I got my macbook a week ago and could not be happier.  I am a Computer Science student that does a lot of programming and the macbook handles that just fine.  Connecting to the internet is easy, the iSight camera and photobooth are very fun, and all the standard mac programs are great.

The laptops shortcomings:  when you close the lid, every thing shuts down into sleep mode (itunes pauses, iChat disconnects, etc.).  This could be an option that I haven't found yet.  The speakers are the another shortcoming of this laptop.  Of course all laptops have bad built-in speakers, but my friend's Dell XPS completly blows these out of the water.  The speaker is quiet, and who thought to put them on the back of the case when the only time you can hear it clearly is when the lid is closed and you can't play music when the lid is closed? (sorry for the extreme confusing run-on sentence). This laptop should come stock with 1GB RAM instead of 512.  I am already starting to see problems occur with only 512.  If you upgrade the RAM, do not buy the upgrade from apple, instead google "macbook ram upgrade", buy the ram yourself, and put it in yourself, it is easy, takes 30 seconds, and you will save hundreds of dollars.

Despite these three somewhat-dissapointing features of this laptop, the good outweighs the bad by alot.  I have been frustrated by my Windows XP machine for months now.  I got a virus and had to reformat my hard drive, the computer takes 2 minutes to boot up fully even after reformatting, and now I am constantly worried about viruses.  The macbook only takes 30 seconds to boot up and I never have to worry about viruses.
I rushed into buying this because I saw an offer of free Parallells and a free carry case, I'm glad that I bought it. I discoverd how well iMovie works with my Digital Camcorder and now I have plenty of time to practice using them together.

The only significant problem I have is using a trackpad instead of a mouse but that's a laptop, not a macintosh, problem.
I am extremely happy with my new MacBook. It is my first Mac, and I have to say that I should have switched long ago.

Setting up the computer was a total breeze. When Apple says that "it can do it all right out of the box", they aren't kidding. All I had to do was fire up the computer, create a username and password, and I was in. I didn't even have to do anything for it to detect my wireless network connection. In fact, not only did it pick up the signal from mine, but several of the neighbors as well! All together it only took about 5-10 minutes!

The features that come on the Mac make all other computers pale in comparison. iLife '06 is included. Some other cool stuff bundled with the MacBook are Photo booth and iMovie, which you can use to take pictures and record movies right out of the box, without any cables to hook up.

Another great thing about the MacBook is its speed. You know how much of a hassle it can be to restart your PC, and it usually takes several minutes. Not on a MacBook. My computer restarts and is ready to use in less than a minute. Web pages and computer programs load faster than ever as well.

I had my doubts about the 13" monitor when I bought my MacBook, but I have to say that they have been disproven. It has an incredable 1280 X 800 screen resolution, and the glossy display is so good that you can see it from accross the room or at an angle; try that with a laptop PC and I guaruntee you'll get a glare.

The MacBook is also amazingly portable. It is very thin and only weighs about five pounds, so it is very easy to carry around the house.

One final feature I'd like to point out is Front Row. The MacBook comes with a remote control that can be used to access this amazing feature, which can be used to watch DVDs or listen to music from accross the room without have to go up to your computer to change the volume, access the DVD menu, ect. Front Row also offers all of the latest movie trailers very conveiently.

As you can see I am very satisfied with my MacBook, and I highly reccomend it. One other note: Mac now supports right-click as well, so be sure to get a two button mouse to go with your new MacBook!! I reccomend the Microsoft wireless notebook mouse which has a very small and portable snap in reciever.
Now that Apple has finally stepped up to the plate in terms of more universal software applications I have made the switch from PC to my first Apple Mac. So after a little research I purchased this shiny new 2.0 Intel Dual Core MacBook. Decided on the middle bracket MacBook model as it had the full power processor and superdrive that the lower-end model lacked for $[...] more. I considered the famed "black beauty" but came  to the realization that 20 more gigs on the harddrive was not worth an additional $[...]. (I'll spend that on dropping 2 gigs into the RAM). Furthermore, after visiting the Apple store and holding one I quickly realized that I did not like the matte finish of the black anyways (a glossy black would have been much more sleek). Very remeniscent of the old-school IBM thinkpads and such.

My first conclusions of this laptop were:

A) "This laptop has cool features like no latch, webcam installed, magnetic AC, and the OS seems very efficient and comparable to Windows"

B) "This laptop is not as fast as I thought it would be; only slightly faster than my 2 year old $[...]Toshiba."

C) "Heavier than I thought it would be and...wait, is that my pants on fire!? This thing runs HOT!!!" (In fact overheating was my main excuse for ditching my Toshiba and dropping $[...] on a new Mac)

The heat is bearable but it worries me because; extremely hot laptop+longterm usage=broken laptop. This is my main reason for not giving this unit a 5th star. So a quick rundown:

Pros:
-Glossy shell and glossy screen make for beautiful laptop inside and out
-Powerfull new processor
-cool features such as webcam, dvd writable drive, magnetic latch and power cord, spaced out keys for my big hands
-reasonably priced for what you get
-long battery life compared to previous laptops I've owned
-Supports a wide range of software including Microsoft Office and Windows. (Though I have read that many programs are not yet equipped to handle the dual processor such as Adobe apps. and Final Cut but this will only be temporary)
-Same processor as the base model MacBook Pro for way less $

Cons:
-At $[...]+ It should really come with at least an 80 gig harddrive
-Constantly runs hot and I fear an emminent meltdown in the future :(
-Not as fast as I had been led to believe but I think adding aftermarket 2 gigs of RAM will remedy that for under $[...].

Would I recommend this laptop to the novice/intermediate, "frugal" comsumer?
Absolutley! Good Luck!
This MacBook is an outstanding buy and you certainly receive a wonderful deal with it.  The iSight Camera, the new keyboard, the MagSafe adapter, the glossy screen, the widescreen screen, the DVD-CD Burner, the 2.0 Gh Intel DuoCore Processor, etc.  are all bonuses.  I would recommend this machine over any PC of cmparable cost, especially with all of the chaos involving Microsoft security and the situations created by Windows XP & Vista.  (Not to mention you could run it on either on this machine should you choose)

The cons are the following: much of apple's usual software has been dropped.  Now you find yourself without a basic office suite.  PCs at least usually come standard with Microsoft Works, but here all you're given is a "text editor" a merging between WordPad and NotePad, neither one of course being very interesting word processors.  You also find yourself losing several PowerPC apps like Nanosaur, but most people could live without those I suppose and instead a couple of new games have been added.

Due to the "dual core" nature of the machine your MacBook also functions as a heating pad which can be a bit of a pain, but not as bad as some reviews have made it out to be.  It is quite sad however that this machine could not have been cooled better.

All an all an excellent buy, not without flaws, but less substantial flaws than almost any PC on the market.
Pro: Amazon experience, fast computer, able to run multiple OS.
Con: build quality

Amazon did a good job shipping it to me in a few days. This is my 3rd Apple laptop. PowerBook G3 Lombard lasted 4 years before the cached on the processor card died. PowerBook G4 12 inch lasted 2 years and the screen backlight gave out. I wish Apple computers lasted a bit longer, like the Hewlett Packard Omnibook which has outlasted both my PowerBooks.

The screen is a reflective, you can see your own reflection or someone sneaking up behind you. The smooth plastic makes the laptop feel like a toy. The keys take a bit getting use to. The trackpad button feels very cheap and does not click very well but I use an external mouse. It terms of how the computer feels, this is the lowest quality product by Apple I have owned.

This computer is fast running applications built for Intel processor. Runs old programs like Microsoft Office a bit slower than the PowerBook G4. One great thing this computer does is run Windows using software called Parallels.

I had to send the computer back for repair because of the trackpad button requiring being pushed very hard before clicks are recognized by computer.

I had to send the computer back a second time because the DVD drive scratches CD and DVD's if the computer is moved when reading from optical drive.

I had to send the computer back a third time because it would randomly shutdown and the optical drive was misaligned. It works great when it is not in the shop but the name for my computer is Macbook lemon.
I have owned several Apple laptops over the past decade, including a Pismo Powerbook G3, iBook G3 Tangerine, iBook G4 white (several models), and a couple of Powerbook G4's. Apple has a fantastic design and great feature set with the MacBook. Considering the feature set and huge performance jump over previous G4 portable Macs, this is Apple's best laptop to date.

WHAT I LIKE:

Size - 13.3" widescreen is not too big, not too small. Good for desktop use, and great for travel. Incredibly, the MacBook only increased .3 pounds vs. the smaller 12.1" iBook (4.9 to 5.2 lbs) and DROPPED .7 pounds from the 14.1" iBook (5.9 lbs)!

Features - fastest processor to date in a Mac portable at 2.0GHz core duo. I tested the DVD to MPEG-4 ripper/converter Handbrake, and my MacBook 2.0 Intel beat an iMac G5 2.1GHz desktop by over 4x the speed! Other great features include magsafe power connector, mini-DVI output, screen spanning (in iBook spanning required a hack), built-in iSight, serial ATA hard drive that is easily replaceable (I put in a 100GB 7200rpm), great new keyboard, long battery life (3.5-4 hours average) and the glossy screen. Yes, I was leery of the glossy screen before purchase, but images look great and glare has not been a problem in many different environments.

Cost - Good price at $1299 for the white considering the $1999 MacBook Pro only adds dedicated graphics, 15" screen, 20GB, backlit keys, and Aluminum shell. For the increased heat, size, and cost, the MacBook is much more appealing to me vs. the Pro model.

WHAT I DO NOT LIKE:

Nothing. Absolutely nothing. I thought I would not like the integrated GMA950 Intel graphics, but the reduced heat and increased battery life of the integrated graphics are of much greater value to me than being able to squeeze more FPS out of a 3D game which I hardly play on a laptop. Apple's entry level laptop is not meant to be a gaming machine.

I originally purchased the white SuperDrive MacBook, but after seeing the black model in an Apple store, I spent the bucks and bought the black model and resold the white. Not that I didn't like the white, it's just that the black is THAT MUCH BETTER LOOKING. In my opinion, the black is worth the $150 premium ($50 for HD upgrade).

I am very pleased with my MacBook and would highly recommend the MacBook to anyone looking for a portable Mac. Just be sure to see them in person before you buy, as I think the black one looks better, so much so that I sold a new white one at a loss just to get the black one here on Amazon.
Overall very pleased with the Macbook.  OS X is so superior to Windows that it's a joke.  Only criticism:  The area just to the right of the trackpad on the white one tends to pick up dirt from the heel of my hand as it rests on it.  The black one, which is virtually identical except for the color and which would presumably avoid the problem is hundreds of dollars more, an added expense that I do not think is worthwhile.
I bought this laptop for my daughters birthday.  She loves it.  I love it myself.  I love the magnetic power cord connector, and the magnetic lid latch.  These are nice features.  Apple pays good attention to detail.  I was tempted to order one of these for myself.  I instead opted for the Macbook Pro 17".

The only things I don't like about this laptop are (minor things):

1) glossy screen has more glare than the normal screens, but better contrast.

2) Speakers are definitely under powered or too  small.  They work fine in a very quiet environment, but are not loud enough in a mildly noisy environment.

3) 512MB of ram is just not enough for OS X.  1GB should have been the minimum (and is in the new core 2 duo model).

I experienced none of the problems people had reported earlier (mooing, random shutdowns, etc....).  It appears that Apple has all the kinks worked out.  I highly recommend this laptop if you can live with the problems listed above.

If you're a windows user and worried about getting a Mac, don't be.  These new Macs can also run windows, but you'll have to buy a copy of Windows to run on them.  If you also buy Parallels software, you can run Windows from within OS X (Needs more memory though).  Nice!
Just love the MacBook. I was a little worried about the glossy screen but after using it for a couple of months I really like it. It is fast with Universal programs and added memory also helps the older programs speed.
I purchased this laptop after my 15" titanium took a nose dive off my dresser. The 13" Tiger system is slick. I love the new features. The screen pops, and doesn't offer the glare problem some have mentioned.

Things i don't like: The width is shorter than the 15" so that when i'm surfing for awhile, my right palm rubs against the edge of the laptop, near the select button. No way around this really, since it's a smaller model. And the other thing is that i bought the lowest configuration to start with, so i find opening and closing apps to be slower than my 15". Even though this is an Intel Core duo. If i were working on it, i would HAVE to upgrade. But for now it's fine for surfing the web.
We love the computer.  It does more than we imagined.  The only thing I would change is:  we would like a slightly larger screen.
i maxed out the ram to 2 gb, but the speed was blazing before i installed it. i see no reason for pc people who have been watching on the sidelines while the mac parade has passed them by not to join in. 13" is just right for a portable, and i plan to use it on the road with garage band, and logic pro, which i am confident macbook can handle [ and why i added the ram ]. the bright screen is nice , but i still need my 1.25 reading glasses to see it properly, which is no reflection on the screen. [ joke, dummys ] great product. oh , i sprung [ gambled ] on the expensive apple care, mainly because i had it on my powerbook, which completely malfunctioned about 3 months BEFORE expiration, resulting in a total overhaul, and subsequent sale of a like new refurbished computer for almost all the dough to buy this macbook
The Macbook 1.83 ghz pros and cons:

Pros:

Mac OS X. Stable Operating System. No viruses. No spyware. No crashes.  Use your digital cameras, camcorders, ipods, mp3 players and you don't need to install drivers!  Just amazing.

Excellent battery life.

Screen is glossy and crisp

Powercord is magnetic so you won't pull down the laptop off a table if you trip over the cord.

Email, Internet, Itunes, iPhoto, iMovie all works flawlessly.  Just plug in your device and start enjoying your work.

Cons: I thought the standard 512MB of memory would be enough but definately get more if you plan to use MS office and the Internet.  512MB is fine out of the box but I've discovered Mac OS X really does operate faster with more memory.  Then again...PC laptops usually come with a weak 256MB of ram and we all know that is horrific.

Review:

This actually will run windoze exceptionally well.  Only problem I've discovered is that windowz is not very appealing after you use mac osx.  Its nice to have "just in case" and I've only needed it when I was trasnferring files from PC to Mac.

Spyware, Viruses and constant crashes are what PCs' are known for.  You won't have that problem with the Macbook. Go with a winner....the Apple Macbook.
I have not found anything I don't like about it. It is 10 temes easier than a PC.....I'll never go back!
i love my mac.  here's the lowdown for the things i was concerned with when buying

+great viewing angle, little glare

+huge trackpad.  you can easily set the trackpad to left click, right click, and scroll

+pretty quiet keyboard.  they're flat, looks fine and took me a day to get used to

-i ran out of memory once just doing basic word/internet/ichat.  i would upgrade memory and harddrive

+superfast

-mac os takes up about 20gb of your harddrive

+mac programs are awesome.  i love ichat

+nice battery life

+very quiet

+heat when charging only.  if my power cord isn't connected, i can comfortably use the lapop on my lap.  when its charging it gets hot.  this is a plus because a lot of laptops are too hot to use even when they're not being charged.

-sharp edges that cut into your wrist.  i highly reccomend buying a marware protection pack.  it helps with the warmth on the palmrests which can be irritating

+no viruses

+it just works.  no installing drivers

-even though you can run windows on it, you have to buy the windows software.  why would i pay extra for an inferior system?  therefore there are a lot of programs out there that i can't use.

+pretty

-scratches on the outer chassis
From the (practically speaking) bullet-proof Mac OS X, to the fit and finish, this laptop has not disappointed.
This was my first Mac. I switched to Apple from PC and nver looked back. This was the best (if you compare amongst similar capabilities) computer that I ever had. Faster to start, never froze, no viriouses, never crashed. Once you get used to the differnt apple system, it is actually very fun to work with.  The cherry on top is the design.

Buy it.
Get the newer Core 2 Duo revision from late 2006, even if you can't find as good a deal on it. This model runs too hot for lap use. Also, these 1st generation machines had variable build quality. I've worked with 4 of them and 2 were 100% solid and 2 are super flaky despite repeated fixes by Apple.
It looks great. But the one shipped to us wouldn't load music CDs. The Apple tech guys advised returning it for a replacement. We're currently mired in Amazon replacement Hell -- UPS saying that the glitch is due to Amazon, and three different Amazon customer service reeps each giving a different story as to how the return/replacement should be handled. So far, then, bad marks to Apple (for shipping a defective machine) and worse ones to Amazon (for being spectacularly unhelpful, and confusingly inconsistent.
I was very excited to switch from a PC to a Mac & after a lot of convincing, my husband agreed to try it.  Well, it showed up and didn't even turn on!  We got it to boot a couple of times, but it wouldn't stay on long enough to get through the welcome screens.  We sent it back and ordered one directly from Apple.  That one works great.  Something must have happened either in Amazon's warehouse or during shipping.
As a very elderly gent, I appreciate the fine operation of the New MacBook.  Especially untouted stuff, like the far better keyboard - the magnetic power connector - the Widget gadget - the Spotlight - and the Safari.  Good stuff, all.  (Well, maybe not completely untouted)
I was a windows user for many years and when Mac launch the macbook I fell in love with its design. After a couple of months saving the money I was finally able to buy it. The first impression was wonderful from the box to the accessories. The macbook is great and I never had any problems with it.

I should had wait to buy the core 2 duo series that came a month later, still a great machine much better than any PC will ever find.

I purchase the 512MB memory but am upgrading to 1GB, its a must.

The only downside I found was the gloss finish which is very easy to scratch.
Receiving my Macbook was an odyssey.  When the box from Amazon initially arrived, it contained... a ten-pound container of laundry soap.  Someone had "removed" the Macbook itself somewhere along the way and placed the soap in.  Since the Macbook I ordered from Amazon had spent several days in Amazon's warehouses while payment details were worked out, I unscientifically concluded that an Amazon warehouse employee had made off with / been complicit in someone making off with my Macbook.

A call to Amazon (well, several calls to Amazon) resolved the issue.  I received a refund the following day, despite initially asking for a replacement.  Be careful when you tell an Amazon employee that you want a replacement and not a refund!

They do NOT know when they will be able to ship a replacement (mine would have taken many days just to get out Amazon's door, which I only found out hours after talking to the first representative... and I needed the 'book before going on a trip three business days later), and once you make the decision you can NOT take it back!  I was lucky in that the Amazon employee I talked to on my third call *told* me that I could not have a refund, but somehow managed to engineer it anyway.  Very strange.

Anyhow, I walked over to my local Apple store that night, picked one up (along with a third-party 2GB memory upgrade)... and wow.  The Macbook is a beautiful piece of machinery.  It's fast, it runs OS X and Windows XP equally well, and it has great battery life for what amounts to a little powerhouse.  With the latest firmware upgrades, the oft-mentioned Macbook heat issue does not exist for me, and I use the Macbook extensively.

I've used the Macbook primarily for my job (software engineer), gaming (World of Warcraft in OSX, Company of Heroes in XP), and watching movies on its fantastic screen.  It has excelled in every way.  I would gladly buy another if anything were to happen to it... but I probably would *not* buy it from Amazon.

An aside: for folks who are looking to take the plunge into OS X... it really is wonderful.  I've been a Windows / DOS user (at work and on my primary home computer) for fifteen years or so, have been increasingly turning to Linux for my alternative computing needs for the past eight years, and upon trying Mac OS X was utterly astonished by how simple and effective an OS can be.  Things *just work*.  It blows away Windows AND the three or four comparable mainstream Linux distros that I've tried in the past year (with the exception of Ubuntu).  It's definitely something to write home about.
My partner and I took our time to search for the most appropriate notebook for me.  I wanted something to fit into a handbag/notebook bag, that I can carry everyday to work and take on business trips, and I needed enough power, as I usually have too many programs running at once.  I am so impressed and just love the feeling when I take my Macbook out in public places and I see the people around me staring!  It's slim and sexy looking AND it does the job better than anything I ever put my hands on.  In the meantime we have upgraded the RAM to 2 GB - excellent!
I have been using a maxed out PowerBook 1400, which finally died.  I have an aversion to spending over $1000 on a laptop, but gritted my teeth and ordered a MacBook from Amazon because they had a great price and I trust them.

What a computer!!! It continues Apple's great operating system and interface with a super fast Intel processor.  I use a Dell PC at work, and I can't wait to get home to my Macintosh.  I also like that it's compatible with my older iMac, so I can easily transfer files back and forth.  All Macs can upload Microsoft files, and save in Microsoft format, so there is no problem working with others.

All in all, I couldn't be more pleased!

I loved this computer for the first week. Then, it died.  Just blackout died completely.  When I took out the battery, it started right up.  Two months later it broke again.  Same thing but the battery trick didn't work this time. When I took it in, they said the hard drive was gone.  They couldn't even recover any of the data.  Getting it repaired took ten days after many, many phone calls to Apple to get me on an expedite list, because the hard drive was on back order!

The guy at computer repair said it's been happening a lot with the MacBooks, that the hard drive is physically ruined.
Pros;

Battery life is long, FAST, fast, fast, goreous screen, Mac OS X, built -in Wifi and Bluetooth.

Cons:

Small HD(but easily upgraded, just pull out the hard drive and replace it with any size HD you wish.) and not much base ram. (1gb seems to be the sweetspot.)

This laptop is an amzing piece of technology. It runs Windows XP( although I don't know why in the world if you have Omac's OS X youd even want XP.) It has exceptional battery life, (5 hours plus.) The MacBook can hadle anything you throw at it. Running several programs all at once is no problem. The machine runs quiet and cool and since APple has fixed the random shut down issues that early models had its a very reliable computer. Like all Apple computer and products, youll look good while using your Mac. Some of the most amzing looking things come out of that company and you'll be the envy of the office, classroom, or jobsite when you pull this machine out. People just love asking you about it.
Update : My first Mac has gone from being a secondary laptop to being my primary laptop.  Mainly due to the excellent OSX and Safari web browser, which beats Windoz and IE hands down. I've become more proficient with Macs.

What I HATE about the Macbook(and also a 17" Powerbook I bought to play around with) is that these things COOKS- an egg!  Flip it upside down and they work as George Foreman grill and you can fry burgers on these.  Updating to 10.5 Leopard is even more demanding.  In Summer I wonder if the laptop is heating up the room more.  It makes the Macs feel inefficient and even (undeservedly) low tech and unreliable. I hope they use better cooling and one of those centrino or whatever comes up next cooler running processors.

Sometimes I wonder if the white plastic casting will melt.  It hasn't but it has turned yellow at the track pad, palm rest etc where in comes with contact with human skin.  This is a manufacturing defect and Apple has acknowledged it and fixed the issue on later White Macbooks.  They offer a free replacement (the palmrest etc only) for the earlier Macbooks IF it is still under the one year warranty.  Well, I  didn't know about this so I missed the deadline .  While most Macbooks are quite problem free, there are many other issues with reliability with the Macbooks and Macbook Pros you can easily find online with a search.

  x  x  x
My first Mac. Switching is like learning to drive a right hand drive car.  A little frustrating at times but the MAC OSX is Very well designed and intuitive and user friendly.  The upcoming Windows Vista looks a lot like a MAC OS.

If you're new, your local store can offer help if you have questions. I also signed up for Pro Care. $99/year .  Also bought .Mac for $99 (or family pack for $179).

When you buy it, it is so nice to carry that box in your hands.

PROS:
Security.  Virus, spyware etc are rare, almost none.

STABLE.
Hard to crash. Especially if you're doing video editing, 3D computer modeling and animation etc.  Pros all switched to Macs now.  Once you go Mac you don't go back.

FAST.

USER FRIENDLY. Simplicity.  Most Mac users love their Macs.  Some very smart little touches.

Very responsive interface.  Computer starts fast. Programs starts fast.

iMovie HD is nice for doing simple hi def HDV editing(upgrade to Final cut express or final cut pro), iphoto a little too basic but ok for digital photo work(upgrade to Photoshop or Aperture), Garage Band is fun and quite versatile if you're a musician, iSight camera is fun for a short while but I hardly use it, good for iChat perhap.

Motion sensing Harddrive!  Prevents damage from sudden movements/ drops of the laptop.  My Sony topend laptop dropped merely one inch on the desk and needed a new harddrive. Not with the Mac.

CONS :
No word processor!
Throw in that word processor darn it.  It comes with a 30 day trial of Apple's own 'Pages' and you can buy MS Word or any other software you want.  It does come with a very basic Text edit.

Laptop gets hot.
Thats why they call it notebook now cause you'll heat your laps, esp when plugged in to ac/dc.

The new GLOSSY Screen is BRIGHT and SHARP with great COLORS. But the Blacks are are not really true black except from certain viewing angles. This is not obvious viewing text. But only when you use a screensaver with a lot of black(which Apple cleverly avoid putting in the system) or viewing DVDs or editing photos.  Most laptops under $1000 are like that except a few premium ones like my other laptop with an x-black screen(on select Sony models) and the blacks are just black and watching DVD's, editing photos are fantastic.  On the Macbook it's just not bad.  Texts look good.  That's a shame because Mac users are often working with graphics.  Macbook PROs are better but at $2-2.7K.

***Tip : You can increase or decrease text size easily by pressing the Apple button and + or - key. How convenient.

Touchpad is large but marginally less responsive if you're used to moving your finger fast. Also it has only one button instead of two like on PC laptops makes it less convenient. But someone on Amazon told me you can go to system preferences>keyboard & mouse>trackpad and enable two finger on trackpad for secondary button.

Magnetic Macsafe power adaptor is nice.

One of the softest sounding built in speakers on the market! I guess they expect you to use either headphones or external speakers. But bring on less wimpy speakers next time please.

NO PCMCIA or PCIexpress slot.  Can't use Verizon Wireless Broadband etc cards. Need Macbook Pro for these(and they use the new PCIexpress, not PCMCIA. Airport(wifi) works great but is not truly mobile.

$200 for a DVD burner upgarde when Dell charges only $50 for upgrade to DVD burner AND a 20GB HD. DVD burners don't cost more on Macs than on PCs.  Another $200 for the Black instead of white shell. Overpriced!  $1099, $1199, $1299 seems about right for the 3 Macbook models. Or throw in some iPod shuffle or nano with those models.

SOLID body but easiy scratched. I always protect mine with a case.

Battery life = a full 4 hrs!  You'll see mac guys using no extention cords often while PC notebooks struggle with their 75 mins.  Also very accurate battery meter compared to PCs!

Software updates takes awhile to download.  Can't they just sell the CDs at the stores or by mail for a coupla bucks ?

I heard the next OS Leopard is going to be faster and better optimised for the Intel core duo.

Did I say fast for video editing?  To my surprise it is similar in speed to the Pro models!  Even in HiDef mode(HDV).

The Macbook PRO models are great for gamers with the seperate graphics card.  But since i'm not too much a gamer , I don't need it.  I HOPE APPLE MAKES A MACBOOK IN 15.4 INCH OR EVEN 17"  SCREEN(aluminium or plastic case)PRICED LESS THAN MACBOOK PRO.

[I also put in a 1gb ram(a must for video editing), it is easy to do yourself. Just search Yahoo/google. Take out the battery, unscrew a metal cover and push a lever firmly and quickly to remove the 256mb ram.  1gb+256=1.25Gb ram works fine(don't have to be 512+512mb). Thousands of us have 256mb rams sitting around going to waste. ]
Pretty much a perfect $1,000 laptop with so much intelligent attention to the user interface.  (Little details like the magnetic power cord attachment are much appreciated - I once pulled my laptop onto the floor by tripping on the power cord so I know.)  I  bought this for my daughter and now I want one.
The best computer I've ever bought. It's gorgeous and fun to use. I am actually proud to use this computer. I used to have a Dell and I hated it. My Dell looked like a brick and was full of spyware and viruses.

It's a great feeling to never have to worry about viruses or spyware.

 I miss the right and left click mouse buttons though. Not sure why the Macbook just has one button. And the computer is very uncomfortable on my lap because of the heat. I usually have to place a towel underneath it. I would give it 5 stars if it did not heat up like a furnace on my lap.

I definitely recommend purchasing this computer, if you are a PC user and are fed up with viruses and spyware. You won't miss the PC after about 2 months of using the Macbook. Join the Mac side. it's worth it!
I have already a PC I use for the Internet but off-line Windows XP has not much to offer. Because English is my third language I could use a good spelling corrector and an exhaustive dictionary. This Mac has them both. The dictionary has more than 20 languages each with their spelling corrector.

There are some more interesting features.
You can connect your digital camera and download your pictures. There is a color-editor if for instance, when you want to enhance the colors of a picture.
There is an almost invisible camera on top of the screen that you can use in i-Chat mode. You can see up to three persons simultaneously on your screen.
If you don't use i-Chat the camera is still good for taking pictures of you and your family.

One setback though, you can 'compose' your own music. But the possibilities are limited.
You have to like the pre-fabricated stuff to experiment with. If not, stick to your MP3.
You have access to an impressive i_tunes store.
I'm using the Macbook right now and it is going well. I enjoy using it compared to my older Dell laptop. The macbook's battery lasts around 3-4 hours. Way better than my Dell. The dell's would report 2 hours and once I used Firefox the battery life would drop to 30 minutes. The transaction went perfectly, I couldn't be more happy with it.

Airport allows for wireless internet and it also comes with a remote. And Mac OSX Tiger couldn't get any better.
So far, I am very pleased with my purchase.  It is quite the upgrade from my 6 year old imac!  Everything seems to be functioning great and I love the look and feel of it all.  The magnetic power plug is very smart and Photobooth is a lot of fun to play with.  I was disappointed when it didn't have a firewire cable included and I had a heck of a time transferring files from my imac...P.S. if you can't open your old computer's harddrive that comes up through firewire onto your macbook's desktop, make sure that both computers have the latest version of Firmware on it. (It took over an hour for Applecare to suggest that to me on the phone.)
As I am making the simultaneous upgrade from a G3 iBook and os 9 to the MacBook and Tiger, it's difficult to decide which to attribute each improvement I experience. In general, I would say that just about everything that previously did not function as described, or only functioned sometimes, has been resolved. Apparently, extension conflicts, system crashes and other labor-intensive software problems are a thing of the past -- but I'm still in the honeymoon phase. I am disappointed that the intel processor will not run os 9, denying access to my favorite old applications and files. Also beware that certain os x apps won't run properly until they have been upgraded to Universal Binary. Appleworks is no longer included. Garageband -- along with the rest of iLife -- is impressive in many respects, but lacks key features a professional would have taken for granted [to encourage new Apple software purchases]. You may also want to consider that Apple's current practices are very damaging to the environment. No noise pollution, however; for which reason this laptop's quiet operation should produce better recordings through the internal mic.
I bought one of the first white macbooks available in June, and was so pleased my family ended up purchasing 2 more.  There are a number of advantages of Macbook over competitive notebooks, but my personal favorites are : glossy screen (nothing like it), MacOS Tiger- clearly better than windows, and the Magsafe power cord.

There were a few technical issues with the first Macbooks, although my family has 3, we never had any issues.  But never fear, Apple stands behind their products.  If you do have an issue, simply take it to the genius bar for an instant repair.  I mention this because if you have a problem with a computer from any other manufacturer, Dell HP etc. your only option is to call their indian support center, then mail it in and wait.  Apples support is not offshore, or I have never gotten any offshore support.  Also the stores are available if you need help.  All in all, great products, great support from Apple.

Plus, if you buy a Macbook, whenever you use it people come up and ask you about it!  That sure never happens with a Dell.
First Mac.  Very cool.  Easy to use.  Did I mention it is very cool?
The size, ease of operation and looks has earned this unit 4 stars. The lack of included programs have dropped it a star. This is my 1st Apple and I have had no major issues after several months of extensive use.
"I'm a Mac!" I love my MacBook!  It works so well and it's awesome!  I think that they are much easier to use and navigate than a PC!  Everything about it is great!  The one and only thing I would complain about it is the fact that you have to expand the window using the bottom right corner (which really isn't a big deal).  Also, the camera on the top is extremely good!  It has a great picture.  I would recommend this to anyone who wished to try something new!  This is a great computer!
I knocked my MacBook off my bunk bed.  It was wide open and fell six feet onto a hardwood floor.  It hit the ground and made the classic boot-up sound.  I thought for sure it was done with, but fortunately it is built TOUGH!  I opened it and it booted without incident.  The screen joints are a little bent, but a little elbow-grease will fix that.
Unfortunately quality and durability of Mac Book is very bad, as well us Apple warranty service. This Notebook is not going to last more than few months with heavy usage.

My died after just few months, due to some logic board failure, which Apple refused to fix.  For the past 4 years I was using Dell latitude 600 and it is still running, despite heavy usage. During 4-5 years period I repaired my Latitude only once(DELL technician came to home and fix it). DELL never decline any service due to "User error/fault" !!!

Stay away from Apple Mac Book.

If you want to run Mac OS, then just buy any Notebook with any Intel Core Dual Processor and install Mac OS on it.
I consider the MacBook to be the best value notebook from Apple.  It has the right combination of features (Bluetooth, SuperDrive, iSight, 2GHz Intel Core Duo).  I bought mine at the Apple Store in Menlo Park, NJ with the 1GB RAM and 80GB HD.
I was a PC user in the past. No question Apple makes a superior product for those involved in digital photography.
I have been very pleased with the MacBook.  I bought it to replace a five year old iBook that was outdated.  The MacBook is fast, easy to use, and seems lighter than the iBook
My first MacBook was a dud. Amazon sent me an electronic return authorization with prepaid shipping label and off it went. Within 24 hours, I had a brand new MacBook with no problems.
Pros: Although there were several negative reviews about this product I couldn't stand and bought one. I think apple technical support is solving all the problems one by one. I have no problems except the Memories I bought from ebay. you have to upgrade the preinstalled 512mb ram. It must be a joke. I went for 2 gigs(2x 1gb) of a unknown brand (omni techonologies) and they are locking the computer when installed together. They are working perfect when I installed only one of them. So check well while buying extra memory. I have installed BootCamp and Windows XP on this crazy machine. Windows runs incredibly fast. Faster than osx I guess. But OSX is amazingly solid.

The price of the Macbook is also really cheap. I've got 100bucks rebate and, 1199$ is the final price of 2ghz white macbook. paid 260$ for 2 gigs Ram. Paid 119 for 120gb SATA 5400rpm HDD. Final total price paid is 1520$. Now I have the fastest core duo portable computer. Check the other PC based Laptop prices and you will see that this thing is really cheap and stylish.

And you have a +-4hour of battery life which is enough for everything youl need.

Cons: The Glossy LCD Screen is not as good as Sony Xbrite technology. The visiual angle while DVD watching is narrow for me. This means all Bright screens are not the same. Some toshiba trubrite screens are not the same quality as well. some trubrite screens are perfect wide and some of them has very narrow video viewing angle. If you don't mind this angle thing than the glossy screen is beautiful.

Go for it! highly recomended!
I bought a Macbook about two months ago, and I was very happy with it... until about three weeks ago, when it just started turning itself off. Completely randomly.

Apparently, this is happening to many other people as well, judging by the chatter on the web.

Do yourself a favor, and buy anything else. Don't buy this machine.
First...don't be fooled by the few vocal posters complaining about lemons.  Any new electonic device has the potential to be DOA, but these are rare, and if you are unlucky enough to get one, AppleCare will take care of the problem with its best-in-industry service...not to mention Amazon's great return policies.

Now, on to the review....

This machine is great.  Here's what's best about it:
1) The OS and free bundled software are awesome!!  This doesn't get much mention, but it is HUGELY important.  iLife is great, OS X is super easy to get going, very secure (do NOT install antivirus [..] as this stuff isn't necessary at this time and can cause problems) and a real pleasure to use.

2) Size.  The Macbook is just over 1" thick and it is relatively light.  But it also feels very sturdy and well built.

3) It runs Windows XP, just like any other PC.  I'm not sure why you'd want to do this, but you can install and run Windows natively with Apple's freely downloaded Boot Camp, and this adds considerable value.

4) The screen is very bright and clear.  I don't much care for the glossy screen because of glare that can appear in certain lighting conditions, but it does look good and many people swear these are better than matte screens.

5) Built-in webcam is actually pretty useful and definitely fun.

6) Upgrades to HD and RAM are very easy to do yourself as access is a breeze.  Just be sure you have a 00 philips and an 8x Torx wrench.

7) My macbook runs very cool.  Even when reinstalling the OS without all the extra languages and stuff I don't need (this gives you several extra gigs), which requires lots of CD reading, disk spinning and stuff, the Macbook never got hot.  Warm, of course, but nothing like what people are suggesting is common.

Now, the not so good...
1) 512 MB of RAM is just NOT good enough, sorry.  I think upgrading to 1 GIG (2x512) is basically a requirement ASAP, which adds about $100.

2) A 60 Gig drive is also not enough for me.  I'd say 100 Gig is a minimum.  This adds another $100, but you can do this when space starts to be really an issue and you also get an extra 60 Gig drive to use as a backup, so it is actually not that expensive and works out in the end.

3) The trackpad and button aren't as comfortable feeling to me as those on my Macbook Pro.  In fact, I'm not sure that I like it at all, but it would probably be easy to get used to.

SUMMARY:  I really do think that this notebook is going to give you the best experience and out-of-box capability for the price.  Just be sure to upgrade the crappy 512 RAM that it comes with and you'll be good to go!!!
Best choice in computers today. Its a great value, same or cheaper than cheaply made competition. And it can run Mac OS X and Windows. Mac OS X is SO much better than Windows. Upcoming Windows Vista is a blatant poor imitation of Tiger. No viruses.

Machine is fast. I upgraded to 2gig of memory. World of difference, many times faster. Parallels is also a must have. Allows you to run Windows and/or Linux at the same time as Mac OS X. Handles multiple monitors great. Instant sleep, awake.

Apple has fixed the mooing issue. System is whisper quiet. It runs cooler with the firmware update but still very hot.

Overall, its clearly the best choice in laptops today.
I have been a loyal Mac user for over 15 years. This MacBook has been trouble almost from the minute I opened the box. Multiple trips to the 'genius bar' at Apple Stores in Denver, Palo Alto, Honolulu and Salt Lake City have failed to resolve the problems with this thousand-dollar-plus hunk of junk.

Aside from the technical shortcomings - not only is the new, shiny screen a failure - as glare in most indoor and outdoor locations is a real problem - the case is entirely plastic and gets incredibly hot if used on a lap or any non-conductive surface.

I've had this machine just two months, and have already had to replace the optical drive (which Apple tells me is unable to cope with DVDs containing paper labels - what happened to Mac's much-boasted about universality?) Now it looks like the logic board is fried - as the damn thing won't start up, no matter what tricks I try off the Apple web site.

As for my multiple appointments at the Apple Stores - beware! Making an appointment is near-impossible as they are only available for the current day, and unless you get in shortly after midnight you may as well fahgettaboutit! You can only make an appointment online, and when the appointments are gone for the day, you're out of luck - unless you feel like coughing up additional money to become a preferred customer.  With what they charge for their products, we should ALL be preferred!

At this point, I'm considering demanding my money back and sinking it into reviving my trusty iBook - which gave me great service for many years. For a $300 investment, old Betsy would be an improvement over this so-called faster, better Mac which is neither.
I don't dare to give a too good review this early because I bought this product before and it failed on the next morning. The replaced one is doing well so far. I hope it won't give me any surprise in the future :)

But I do want to give a "five stars" rating for Amazon's customer services. As the first Apple had problems, I returned it and requested another new one. The whole process is quick and smooth. I had been contacting Amazon several times and continually got prompt assistance.
This was an amazing product from Apple.

I'm very much satisfied with its sleek and stylish look, feather weight, glossy display.... list goes on 'n on..

I would say onething very clear - Don't ever miss a chance to buy this one !

Good Luck !!
Google for "macbook sudden shutdown", you will know what I'm talking about.
Apple doesn't have a solution yet.
If I had bought it from local store, definitely I would return it to get my money back.
Sending it to apple store? then I'll be without a computer for several weeks. then get a replaced logic board or some thermal stuff. Well, then.... the problem will be back.
I have to wait and see, before Apple figures out the problem, I won't send it in, unless they are nice to give me an exchange
I just bought the base model Macbook here on Amazon, and I am LOVING it.  I don't think I will ever go back!  It is compact but still completely functional.  It's perfect for when I want to go to the pub and drink a beer while working on the computer (well, it's perfect for everything, but it only gets better when you can work at the pub).  I was concerned about how many reviews I have seen complain about how hot they get, but I don't think this gets any hotter than the Dell laptops I have used.
Like many other long time PC users I'd often wondered what the Mac was all about.  After working in a new department that is exclusively Apple, I decided I like Macs because they are simple to use and pleasant to look at.

I've had the Powerbook since it came out and it's a great machine.  It has never frozen up once or had any system problems at all.  Its super fast and it connects to any wireless network very easily with a very strong signal.  The screen is beautiful and glossy although a bit hard to clean...you really have to get screen wipes.  I love having a central portable hub for all my music (IPOD) pictures and movies and the sound is great (with headphones....the speakers are worthless)  For me the keyboard fits my hand perfectly and I really like using all the Apple shortcuts to speed up the interface.

The only downside is the machine does run very hot so you really need to use it on a table or with a buffer in between your legs.

I guess the biggest criticisms of Macs are their price and program incompatibility.  So yes, you are paying for aesthetic beauty but we do that in many items we purchase so why not with computers?  As to their lack of product support, with the introduction of the Intel chip and their ability to run Windows, that won't really be an issue.

Bottom Line:  A great laptop computer with simplicity and style for around 1100.00 (with student discount through Apple)
I purchased this MacBook because one of my good friends recommended it so highly. He waxed poetic for days how easy and intuitive it is to use, how, well, I'd just fall in absolute love with it once my fingers touched its white shell. Well he was wrong. Seeing how the base model ran me almost twelve hundred dollars I could not justify keeping it. Several factors weighed heavy on my decision to go back to a PC. First off, the edge where your hands rest is constantly being scraped by the rough edge (the top shell doesn't extend far enough, so there is a very rough edge where your wrists rest). Second, the speakers are very tin sounding. My five-year-old laptop sounds better (truthfully). Third, if you want to bring the RAM up to a gig, it's another 200.00 dollars. Third and 1/2, it only comes with a 60 gig hard drive (60 gigs!?! 1200.00 bucks after tax and additional RAM added?). Fourth, it does run hot. My legs started to sweat after about an hour's usage. It wasn't unbearable, but uncomfortable nonetheless. Fifth, the screen left me wanting more. Really, if you don't believe me, go to your local computer store and compare the screen to a pc screen that goes for the same price; it's night and day. Sixth reason, the keyboard layout felt mushy and the keypad layout is really whacky (the keys are hard to find). Seventh reason, you can't burn DVDs with the drive it comes with standard (What? Are you kidding me? 1200 bucks and I can't burn DVDs?). Eighth reason, I returned my MacBook and purchased an HP dv5220 and wow!! that's when I REALLY saw the difference. The HP I exchanged for was almost 300 cheaper after mail in rebates. And check this out; it CAME WITH OUT-OF-THE-BOX a mobile Duo Core processor, ONE GIG of RAM, a HIGH DEFINITION screen (it really is beautiful. Stunning.), a 128 bit graphics card, DVD SuperMulti a DVD-RAM, DVD+/-R double layer drive with LightScribe (Lightscribe "etches" a label onto your disk. No more smudgy labels, you print them with your laptop. It's a great technology), EVERY port you could ever hope for  comes standard, including future ports that you will want to have 6 months down the line (ExpressCard/54 slot also supports ExpressCard/34) and Type I/II 32-bit card bus (also supports 16-bit// VGA (15-pin), TV-out (S-video) (I said everything!), notebook expansion port 2, microphone-in, headphone out with S/PDIF Digital Audio), and some of the best speakers I've ever heard on ANY laptop... But if you really want a Mac, none of this matters, you're going to still run out and slap your cash/ credit card down on the counter with a big devilish grin on your face and say: "Hurry up salesperson, I've got things to do! Bring me my MAC!!". But I on the other hand, personally, just don't get it (never will, either). Honestly, I do not understand why so many people love their Macs. I think if I had to offer up a reason they sell like hot cakes is probably marketing. Every ad Apple runs on the TV portrays PC users as idiots and Mac users  as cool. Just look at the new ad they just put out, the one where the pc guy is fat, bald and speaks French, the Mac user, well he's hip, full head of hair and oh yes, he's attractive (I guess Apple feels that fat, bald, French people are idiots and if you don't buy their product, well, you're an ugly idiot, too. Do you really wanna be an ugly idiot? No? Well if you don't you better run out and grab a Mac. People really fall for this? It just disgusts me. How most consumers don't see how big corporations play with the consumer. How they feel you aren't smart enough to see through their marketing schemes. But I digress and it's getting late) ...For me looks don't matter, it's what's on the inside that counts. Wow, now THAT should be pc's new slogan. Hope you find what you are looking for.
I love the look the feel and OSX but the shutdown issues apple has with some of this notebooks is something to worry about. I would buy it again if I needed another notebook. OSx is great and very clean OS. Battery life is typical about 3 hours for a dvd and with wireless internet I get about 2.5 to 3 hours avg. I would be careful running dvds with a printed sticky label as the drive tends to eat them for lunch. If you buy one get the most amount of ram and hard drive you can afford. I went to Thailand to start teaching English and right before leaving I started having trouble with my macbook. So I called US support before leaving and told them whats happening and they said to just reset. Well 3 days later I am in Thailand and the note book shuts off every time I turn it on. apple care in Thailand is 8 hour away and can not be shipped they told me so 2 trips to bangkok and now she runs fine with a new heat sink.

I love my mac. Still a windows user but I am very impressed.
I bought this MacBook for my wife to use in law school even though the school required a PC and wouldn't give me any assurance that the MacBook loaded with Windows would be OK. Well turns out its better than OK, Windows XP was no more difficult to install than usual and it works great with her testing software. The added benefit is that she gets to do most of her work in the OS X environment and I don't have to hear her complain about having to use Windows.
My MacBook started RSDs last Friday the 13th after using it for 2 months. It's very frustrating to be working on something or reading a web page and all of the sudden the screen goes black. Then you have to restart and it doesn't even want to start right away. I also sometimes get RSD after powering up and logging into my user account and when waking it from sleep. For the record, I ordered this from another online source, not Amazon.  First it took a month to even recieve my MacBook. When I did recieve it, It had a lazy pixel and now has 3. Then I had trouble with the super drive, it refused to open or eject a CD I put in. Now RSD. Fortunately I procrastinated taking it to the Genius Bar otherwise I would have been in there 3 times getting it serviced. Making an appointment has not been easy, I've been trying for 2 days (I still don't have one), maybe they are getting an over load of MacBooks in for service. I talked to tech support and they said they are aware of the problem and I need to take it in for service.  Well they have been made aware because this has been going on for a few months and there are thousands of complaints about RSDs and the super drive defects. There's even a web site devoted to the RSD problem started by a disgruntled consumer. If you do a google search on MacBook random shut downs, you'll get tons of links with info and complaints on this. Or go to Apple's Support discussions pages.  Supposedly the heatsync and logic board need replacement, which may or may not help. Some people in the message boards have complained that they started getting RSDs soon after getting the parts replaced.  Supposedly the latest production MacBooks will have the new parts.

I just wanted to post this because I wish I had known this would be a widespread problem before I decided to buy the MacBook. I hope this helps you decide whether or not you should buy a MacBook. I wish I had purchased the PC notebook I was considering instead.

Added 10/28/06. Just wanted to follow up and say that Apple has just made a Firmware update available. This should help to stop the RSDs. I did the update last night and so far I have not had an RSD today. Keeping my fingers crossed.

Update 10/21/08, I still use this Mac Book. Finally got the thing fixed and was happy with it until, one of my speakers went out right before the warranty expired. I took it to the Genius bar 1 week before the warranty ran out and they fixed it. only then the fan ran a lot more. But other than that I have gotten great use of it.
I got my macbook three weeks ago. I like the new macbook. But i also experienced a major shut down, out of nowwhere, like the very next week. Nothing worked.  It took a day or two to get it to work again. But that was the only major issue, so far, hopefully!  The keyboard needs a little getting used to. All the other features are pretty neat, though.
i already hv it for 1 month and 20 days and i have never experienced the randow shut down like you guys were talkin about,, it might be they have fixed it or i got the got one... the only problem i hv.. this thing is runnin too damn slow for me,, might be i just need macbook pro... afterall this is a good thing if u don't multi task it too much like i do..
Don't buy this.  After you've had it for a month or two (ie after the 15-day return window) it will start shutting itself off randomly more and more often until it becomes useless.  If you call Apple, trying to get them to admit there's a problem is like pulling teeth, and even if you succeed, the solution is for you to mail them your laptop and do without it for two weeks.  Because of their defect.  Wonderful.
I bought this computer 5 months ago , but now I am experiencing random shutdown . I hope Apple will make a recall on this product .
I wanted to switch to the Macintosh platform for many years, and finally the MacBook allowed me to do it: the right combination of price and product. I'm quite happy with the result, although there is one big thing in the midst of my happiness that doesn't allow for complete satisfaction, or a 5-star rating for that matter.

Let's get the negatives first: there are issues, significant issues, with a number of MacBooks. Apart from the mooing or the staining, finally minor things in the great scheme, the problem that it's potentially deranging is the Random Shutdown. My MacBook, bought from Amazon, is experiencing one of the potential Random Shutdown Situations: the cold one. Almost inevitably, when starting up or waking up after a long while, it shuts down without warning. After a while, I turn it on and let it get warmer, and works like a charm.

A charm indeed: this is a powerful, flexible and elegant computer, with marvelous graphics, great speed and easy-to-understand organization. It allows for productive usage almost right on and leaves very little to be desire, but for a little better case, since the connections between the sides and the top case / keyboard are rather unconfortable unless you have your hands clearly over the top, and not on it as many do. Besides that, the only compliant, and it's really nothing, is the fact that many parts of the case don't fit together perfectly and feel like they are a little loose.

Then again, many users complain about more serious random shutdowns, including getting to the point that the computer is almost useless (not my case). So, beware. When mine works, and it does most of the time, it is a wonderful computer, working with a consistency, elegance and speed that shames Wintel machines. It boots fast, really fast, and it's ready for work almost inmediately, unlike those tortoises running XP; updating the OS is rather unobstrusive; using external devices is quick and simple; ditto with installing new software. All in all, even the pics included for desktop images are great.

What is not right, besides the real problem of the shutdowns? I'd like another USB port, since two are too few; I'd also like an standard Video Out connector, not the MiniDV thing that requires an adapter; certainly I'll prefer an internal modem instead of an external, USD 50 one. And the internal speakers are poor in quality. And I'd have fitted the parts more precisely, with less wiggly room between them.

My recommendation? Read Apple's discussion boards, and if you can wait a couple more weeks, do take your time till there's a clear solution to the many different Random Shutdown scenarios, that apparently are in the neighbourhood of 5% of the installed base. If you need the computer for mission-critical apps, do wait. If you live in a place without easy access to AppleCare, the post-sale maintenance service, be extra-careful. If it's not the case or you are just really willing to try it, take the plunge. Do buy one. It is a great computer and for the majority of users that have a perfectly working computer, the experience is extraordinary.
Never worked from the first day I received it from Amazon. Still waiting on a refund
I have had both Mac's and PC's for years.  When the new Intel-based Macbooks were released, I decided I had to get one.  I did not want (or need) the very highest-end model (Macbook Pro) or need something as large as a desktop (Mac Pro), as I already have other desktop computeres.  So I decided on the Macbook instead, and I am thrilled with it.  There are only a few PC programs that I absolutely need to run, and with the Macbook and Parallels Desktop, I can run them on a single machine.  Very happy with the purchase.
I've had my new MacBook base model for a little over a month now and I'm really happy with it.  The first Mac I used was OS 8.6 so I give Apple a lot of credit for their new operating systems.  X11 has become my best friend, and I never knew a Mac could be so versatile!  I've found so much open source and gnu (freeee!) software that I never knew existed and I'm a lot happier with my Mac than I thought I'd be.

I have had no problems with the hardware or software and my only complaint is cosmetic.  I heard rumors of the wrist rest area on the white MacBooks becoming dingy and stained from your palms, and of course it happened.  There's practically no way to get rid of it, but I covered it with a Protection Pack pad from Marware before it got too bad.
The individual system I bought from Amazon was a lemon. It worked, but erratically. So I take it in to the local repair shop, and it turns out that I had a bad logic board (that it, what most people call a motherboard) and they send it off to Apple to get the logic board replaced.

That was *two weeks ago*. Apple says they don't have the part to replace, even after two weeks, and they don't know when they will be in stock.. So, I have paid for a computer that I cannot use (or even see...).

When the system ran, it ran fine and was fast and all that. But if you are unwilling to wait forever if you need repairs, you should think twice before buying a MacBook.
This has to be one of the absolute best things I have ever bought. Yes, I am a Mac user, but I can guarantee that you will fall in love with this machine if you're coming over from Windows. It is extremely fast, even the basic model has a web cam, Bluetooth, WiFi, and one of the brightest screens you will ever see on a laptop. You can edit video and mix music all with the included iLife suite that also lets you make fun podcasts and web sites of your own.

Battery life is amazing, most of the time the screen's so bright, you can just turn it down a little and save a lot of power. It's a blast not worrying about viruses, spyware, malware, adware or trojan horses and instead videochatting, editing video, taking pictures with the built-in camera, editing photos, and yes, still doing taxes, word processing and spreadsheets.

What's not to like? It gets a tiny bit warm, but you know, with a computer this fast, it's completely acceptable. It's noticeable, but never ever too warm on my lap. The speakers could be a little louder, but these are itsy bitsy quibbles.

I love these laptops, and I know you will too.

One suggestion- Running Windows is there for you if you need to run some specific Windows-only software, but if you don't need that, it's better to just use the Mac and disover how completely spectacular it is!
I'm already a Mac user and own several.  Also been buying Apple computers since 1986.

Unlike other reviews, I'm not rating the excellent and stable operating system.  I'm just rating the computer itself.

What a great little machine.  No problems whatsoever.  Looks like Apple fixed the issues regarding the staining of plastic.

The power adapter has a built-in cord caddy and it also converts from a power brick into a fully corded adapter by changing the prongs over to an included and optional cord.  Also the connector on the computer is magnetic and break-away which protects you from pulling the computer off a table when tripping over the cord.  There is an green/red indicator light right on the connector.

The computer instantly sleeps when you close the lid and it wakes within 2 seconds of opening the lid.  Battery life is about 4 hours during use and in sleep mode the battery lasts for days.  The lid is latched via a hidden magnet - nothing here to break and the lid closes tightly.  Very nice.

You can also turn off the back-light in the screen if you want to use the computer with an external monitor.  Otherwise you'd have to close the lid and that would put it to sleep.

The screen is high gloss but it hasn't been a problem and it's very bright even when using it outdoors.

The built-in wireless networking is flawless and the bluetooth worked instantly with my cell phone.

All the ports are nicely organized on one side of the machine and the DVD slot on the opposite side.

The caps-lock and the num-lock keys are actually back-lit green.  They glow green from behind when activated.  In a darkened room, this looks very cool along with the light up Apple logo on the front of the lid.

The tiny iSight camera is built in right above the screen and the resolution is incredible when you compare it to average web cams.  There is a microphone on one side of the camera and a little green LED on the other which indicates the camera is live.

Everything is very very nice and it looks very nice too.  Excellent computer for the money.  First class all the way.  Don't forget the $100 rebate...  two seconds to fill it out online - no hassles, no paperwork required- VERY easy!
I bought this computer a few weeks ago after the iBook I had used for about 3 1/2 years finally died, and there were some nice surprises on this new model.  Though Apple computers in general are relatively expensive, I find that it's a worthwhile trade-off for features such as an incredibly user-friendly OS, durability (my old iBook lasted years despite a fall down a stairs and a Pepsi spill!), and of course the aesthetics.

Pros:

-Tech specs: Though this obviously depends on what you might use the computer for, I find that the memory, processing speed, and disk space are more than enough for using the internet, watching movies, listening to and storing plenty of music, word processing, and other common tasks.

-Improved power adapter: On my old iBook, the adapter had warped fairly easily and I had to replace it, but the magnetic version on the MacBook seems very sturdy.

-Remote control: Very simple, light remote control that can easily contol music, dvds, and photos from several feet away.  Very convenient way of playing music without having to go to the computer constantly to change a song.

-Built-in camera: not necessary, but lots of fun!  Also, surprisingly good resolution.

-Speed: a much quicker processor than the previous model.  I can run the internet, iTunes, and other apps all at once without issues.

-Screen: absolutely gorgeous!  A serious improvement, crystal-clear image quality.

-The OS: As always, very intuitive and easy to pick up, and the help menu will answer almost any question that might arise.

-Heat issue?: I've read some reviews claiming that the computers becomes terribly overheated, but mine seems not to have had that problem.  As long as you try to avoid soft surfaces and use it on a desktop or other flat surface, even a textbook, you should be fine.

Cons:

-The included apps: Though some basics, like an internet browser, iTunes, and iPhoto, are included, you'll likely find that you'd like to add some things, by either buying them or through free downloads on the Apple site.  Appleworks is no longer included, so you'll likely need an office suite, and even the included games are fairly week (such as backgammon and mancala).

-Media files online that require shockwave, windows media player, etc. are often hard to find ways to run, since many of these types of programs do not yet have updates that are compatible with intel-based macs (though I expect this will be resolved within a few more weeks).

-Speakers: I would definitely recommend external speakers, as the built-in ones are not loud enough and have relatively poor sound quality.

Overall, aside from the flaws that can mostly be worked around, this machine is both fun and easy to use, very attractive, and most importantly can perform most tasks one might need a computer for with little to no problems.  As a Mac user for years, I highly recommed their products in general, and this computer is definitely no exception.
Still there are many errors with setting up bootcamp for using

microsoft windows system. You need to buy USB mouse and keyboard to install windows in MacBook. Be careful....
I ordered this unit from Amazon as my first MAC computer. The screen is too small, even after increasing the font sizes and zooming in I still had difficulty viewing the screen. Also the touchpad was nearly impossible to use. I suggest that anyone using this computer purchase a USB mouse to use with it because the pad is terrible.

I do not suggest buying this unit as your first Apple computer.
This is my first ever mac.  I decided to make the switch when they came out with the new Macbook because of its ability to run both Windows and OSX.  I don't have a Windows OS running yet, but I thought that I'd like to have that option when Vista comes out.

There are many things that I like about the MacBook: built-in camera, great software, easy setup and interface, function buttons that actually have a purpose.  The best word I would use to describe it is "intuitive."  Everything just seems to make sense.

Reservations:

1. There have been issues with discoloration of the MacBook.  I'm not sure if it has happened yet, but I have the fear that it's starting to happen on the touchpad and where my palms rest.

2. I can't play some windows media files.  Apparently this problem will be fixed this fall though.

3. The speakers are really weak.

4. The edge of the MacBook cuts into my wrists sometimes.

Those though are minor problems, and I would recommend the MacBook to anybody who's looking for an easy-to-use entry-level priced laptop with a lot of features.
Although this is personally my first computer, I do use my parents' and siblings' computers, which are desktop dells or powerspec computers.  This is easily one of the best computers I have seen or used, outpacing them easily.  Unlike most pcs, it has a quick start up and login, and all apps start up quickly.  It reads dvd and video cds without any skipping, although this may be because of the vlc media player that I use, which I recommend to anyone.  It is free to download, and I have not yet found a format it cannot read.  It can also rip dvd's easily, although the file takes up some space.  For this computer, I have so far bought an ac/dc converter for the car ($30 at radioshack), a samsonite case, a little wireless mouse, and a seagate 120 hard drive.  These all accompany the computer easily.  Agreeing with another reviewer, it does get a litte hot sometimes, but mostly I use it on my desk, so there is no effect.  The sound is decent for a laptop is decent, but if you are travelling, it is probably better to use headphones.  The day the computer was supposed to come, I rushed home to set it up.  It took less that half an hour, and easy to do. The first time I connected to the internet, I had to install no software or hardware.  All that was needed was to select my network from the taskbar.  For ex-pc users, os x takes some getting used to, but it is such an easy system to use and configure, that it takes almost no time.  The keyboard is a great layout, not at all cramped, and now I find regular keyboards to be odd.  Small features like the dashboard are so convenient.  Just press f12 and you find out pretty much anything you want, from the present air quality in northern Germany to the price of oil in Thailand.  I have installed mic office instead of open office, but I have no regrets, as I did not pay for it.  I have noticed that with the os x version, microsoft is nicer and easier.  For virus software (although you hardly need it) I have ordered an intego product, which unlike some symantec products for mac, do not erase your hard drive.
Great computer, great laptop.
Perfect from out of the box. One month intensively working with without any problem. The best laptop I ever had. I strongly recommend it. The price is also very low for what you get. Adding Parallels Software you can be inside any digital environment. I'm proud to have it and it is the -what I want- for all of my proffesor colleges at the University.

Congratulations Apple!
I purchased this model about a month ago.  It's amazing.  Sure some people here complain about their cursed electronic equipment, but don't let them discourage you.  It does have a good warranty and Apple retail stores are everywhere if you need help.

It's a wonderful product.  The screen is perfect, not too big; not too small.  The widescreen is a definite improvement over the screens used in the previous iBook models.  Nice and bright, as well.  The keys are great.  Built-in iSigh is wonderful.  The new power adapter is great.  The processor blows me away, frankly.  I can't believe how much faster it really is.

Just make sure you buy a sleeve so your new baby doesn't get scratched up.
great computer.  worth every penny.  the only bad thing is the fact that it gives off a lot of heat.  makes your left thigh real toasty.
Having owned a Powerbook G4 12" laptop for the past 2 years, I found myself very hesitant to upgrade to the Macbook 13" laptop. I loved my 12" Powerbook as it offered plenty of power and was compact enough to easily and comfortably carry around with me if need be. I put off buying a Macbook hoping that Apple might change its mind and release a 12" Macbook Pro, but once I began to realize that it wasn't going to happen, I decided now might be as good a time as any to go ahead and jump into the Intel Mac world. Now I had to decide if I wanted to black Macbook or the white one. Decisions, Decisions.

I went with the white after seeing both models at the local Apple Store, as the white one just had that sleek look to it and so many other laptops out there are black so I wanted mine stand out a little. After getting my glossy new Macbook three days ago, I've now realized that not only was it the best Mac-buying decision I've ever made, it is probably the best computer I've ever owned in my 24 years in the computer buying business - period!

The new glossy widescreen LCD is stunning. There's not much more I can say to convey the sheer quality of this display. The Macbook also sports a brand new keyboard that makes typing on the it a dream. The keys have a lot of spring to them and have a nice little amount of space in between each of them that keeps you from accidentally hitting two keys at once. Next up is the trackpad. Apple already had one of the best trackpad input devices in the business, but now they also have one of the largest. This thing is huge and makes moving around the screen a breeze, whether you're right-handed or left-handed.

As if all these new innovations weren't enough, Apple has even thought to include a built-in iSight camera that resides in the middle at the top of the LCD display. This makes chatting with your fellow iChat AV users an entirely new experience with the ability to see each other via the camera. I personally don't find myself using it much, but there's something comforting about knowing it's there. The final new touch of the Macbook is the mag-safe power connector that uses a magnetic force to hold the power connector onto the computer. The functioning behind this idea is that if you were to accidentally catch your foot on the power cord it wouldn't pull your shiny new laptop off of the desk and break it. It's not much, but a nice safety touch nontheless.

The main question on people's minds is, "Is the new Intel Macbook fast enough or should I go for the Macbook Pro or Desktop model Intel Mac?" Well, to say the Macbook is fast would be the understatement of the century. This little thing is a speed-demon. From booting OS X Tiger up, to running many of the native applications like Safari and Mail, you'll be shocked at just how speedy the Macbook is. Even running non-native apps like Microsoft Office or Adobe Photoshop is still pretty solid in the speed department. With the built-in 512MB of RAM, the computer is still faster than the previous Powerbook G4 models, but if you want to see what the Macbook can really do, bump your memory up to 1GB or even 2GB. This will turn your Mustang into an Indy car.

As I mentioned above, if you want to get the most out of your Macbook, bump up the internal RAM. Another thing you might want to consider if you decide to go with the white Macbook is installing a larger, and possibly even faster, hard drive. The white Macbook comes with a 60GB hard drive, which for many people, will be plenty but for those of us who tend to fill those drives up quickly, you might want to add something bigger. I added a 7200rpm 100GB Seagate Momentus hard drive that added not only 1800 more rpms than the stock 5400rpm drive included, but also 40GB more of storage space. Even this small speed increase has already paid dividends with my video useage.

At the end of the day, you won't find a more powerful or affordable notebook computer out there. The little Macbook rivals some workstations out there at the moment and proves that laptops are getting just as powerful as many desktop computers in the industry. No more having to sacrifice power and function for smaller size. If you want what is possibly the best laptop computer ever made, and one that will run not only the amazing Mac OS-X Tiger but also Windows XP, then look no further. You've hit paydirt with the Macbook.
This is my first Mac ever. I was so tired of Windows, had enough of it & decided to switch. About 3 months ago I visited a friend, who has an iMac. 15 minutes on it & I knew I needed a Mac. That's right, the next thing I did was buy this new Intel MacBook, have had it for about 6 weeks now & am loving it!!!

It's very fast. I like Mac OS X, it's so much better. Everything I need is included, media player, iTunes, CD/DVD burning software etc, I mean everything's included. Won't need a thing more.

I haven't upgraded my RAM, 512 mb is adequate for my kinda use. Although I did find my MacBook running slow when I was using safari, iTunes, iPhoto & burning a DVD all at the same time.

I just love the screen, it's the best I've ever seen. It's a nice not too big, not too small, wide screen. Pictures & videos just look stunning!! Lovely colors too. (I wonder if it's a HD screen, if it's not then it's close). The reflection on this glossy screen doesn't bother me much.

The slot loading DVD super drive is just great, why didn't anyone else think of it. The drive doesn't come out like in other laptops. All you have to do is push a DVD in the slot & it sucks it right in, that's it. It's such a compact design with nice finish. Looks very neat all around.

I quite like the keyboard, it isn't crammed, but nicely spaced out. Feels great, solid while typing on it too. Very comfortable to use, not like the regular laptop keyboards where the keys are all so close to each other. I've used IBM laptops a lot, they have the best keyboards & this comes close.

The wireless on this one is the strongest I've ever seen on any machine & is very very stable. It catches signals that my IBM laptop wouldn't catch before. You don't even have to configure it, does it automatically in like 2 seconds!! I've had absolutely no problems with it.

The built-in webcam is great, have used it about 3 times so far. That's what I mean by everything included, absolutely no need to buy anything extra, you'll find everything you need on the MacBook.

The remote control is a super idea. You can use it to run iTunes, play DVDs, view pictures, such a lovely feature. It's so convenient, you don't have to be close to the computer, as long as it is on, you can use the remote from wherever you are in the room to operate it. It reminds you of iPod shuffle, so do the controls.

I have only a couple of issues with it. Yes, it does heat up, not burning hot, but quite hot. And, I'm surprised no one noticed it, the fan vents are just under the LCD screen and all that hot air blows directly on it. Doesn't this affect the screen, reduce it's life or something?

Overall, it's the best machine I've ever used. I'd highly recommend it. Go get one.....

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
It's been 9 months & am still loving it! Good Bye PC!!!!!!!
People, what's wrong with you? Wake up!

How can a marketing campaign be so effective?

Read the reviews. The issues are real. I returned my mac due to overheating, random shutdowns (twice is all it took), insufficient RAM out of the box, smallish hard drive, no double layer DVD support, DVD burning capabilities only on the more expensive models and TERRIBLE customer support.

This is a review about this notebook. Not the operating system. I have had both windows and mac laptops and will not ramble here about the pros and cons of one or the other. But the popularity of THIS notebook is completely undeserved.

With my money back I got a fully loaded notebook with double the HD capacity, 4 times the RAM, a newer (presumably faster processor -Intel Core 2 Duo), dedicated graphics card, double layer DVD recorder with lightscribe, bigger and brighter screen, and most importantly: superb, friendly costumer service. Oh, did I mention that I got 2 extra years of customer support and all-inclusive express repairs included in the price? If you need to know, I ordered it from HP but similar deals can be had from Dell and others.

I am not here to promote any other notebook, but if you really want bang for your buck do your research and don't buy for looks, see what you can get for your hard-earned money from a PC company.
This is my first Apple notebook computer, I've had a Powermac G5 for 2 years.  I finally decided to get the macbook now that you can run Windows at the same time.  I need windows strictly for Visio diagrams at work.  You can run Windows at the same time within Mac OS X using Parallels workstation software.

The hardware is top notch and design gets lots of attention from coworkers and friends.  My only concern was possible heat problems that I had read about but I haven't noticed at all.  It is much cooler than my old Compaq work provided notebook.

If you're looking for a notebook with the most flexibility then this, or a macbook pro, is your best choice.  You can run OS X, Windows, and *tons* of open source software under X11 or within the terminal.  The macbook is a lot of computer for a great price.
I traded in my 12" iBook for one of these tantalizing sirens. It is thinner, much faster, brighter, bigger screen--really, a gorgeous screen even at less than full brightness; not an issue at all with the new glossiness--with more features like integral trackpad functionality and onboard bluetooth. The trackpad functionality is sooo nice (tap for click, two finger scrolling, etc., customizeability, out of the box).

My only gripe is that the lower edge along which one tends to rest one's wrists is a bit on the sharp side, as mentioned elsewhere. When my wrists tilt down past parallel, it is distinctly sharp in comparison to its predecessor, the iBook. Parallel and above, not an issue.

However the hooplah over the hot battery is overblown in my opinion and not much worse than the heat generated by the iBook. I use it all the time on my lap with bare legs and it has not bothered me. The redesign of the keyboard is very nice and the key action is more positive than the relatively mushy iBook's was.

Really nice price point for a great little package overall. I have not upgraded the memory yet, but will soon, so cannot comment on the purported performance gains that many say come with this, but I am looking foward to an effortless swap over due to the new and improved access to both the memory and the HD, which upon a cursory glance looks to be much improved.

Great package. Nice $[...] rebate from Amazon didn't hurt either.
This is a very sleek machine with responsive keyboard; what sold me was the picture/video quality, attractive and eye catching but....

dislikes:
-requires lots of hard drive space; took about 17 gigs for 40 minute home movie.
-battery runs excessively hot
-battery life is about 2 hours after a full charge, web surfing / playing chess

-Update 8/15/2006: Help please! - sounds from my home movies don't work on IPOD video. I've tried using Imovie, and Itune's "convert to IPOD" functions, both convert the Video and i can load video to the IPod, but the sounds are missing; video works find using Quicktime.  Any suggestions?

Update: 8/16/2006: I went to the [...] website - over 500 complaints on converting mpeg video to ipod video.  The included software on the macbook can't convert Mpeg with "muxed video", which is generally the video you get from your camcorder/digital camera.  "Apple Discussions" suggested using a freeware 3rd party software "Mpeg Streamclip (Mpeg SC)" to convert mpeg muxed clip to "DV".  I was able to convert 1 clip to "DV", which loaded to the ipod video, then I tried another clip, and Mpeg SC could not convert the file (mpeg clip was shot with the same camera).  I bought this macbook specifically to make ipod/itune/imovies etc much easier - but in fact, i'm more frustrated - returning this macbook today, hopefully it won't be as frustrating as using this machine for the past 16 hours!!!

Bottom line: There are a lot of less expensive laptops out there that work very well with Itune/Ipod. If you're looking for a machine that is integrated well with the Ipod, don't let this Apple fool you.
I have had many Macs, and this one is right up there with all of them. Very good product as all Apple products are.

Wish it had more ram and a larger hard drive as standard.

I like it so much I bought another one for my son.
I am a consultant who is replacing a 3 year old PowerBook G4 867 MHz. Since I don't need the advanced graphics of the MacBook Pro, I got the 2.0 GHz MacBook. It didn't feel that fast with the stock 512 MB RAM, but has performed beautifully since I upgraded it to 2 GB RAM. Universal applications (Mail, Safari, DayLite, OmniGraffle) all snap open and run quickly. Non-Universal applications (MS Office, QuickBooks) also launch quickly and have run very well. Using a FireWire cable to transfer over from my old PowerBook was pure simplicity, and even the search terms I use in Safari copied over (I was stunned).

The only complaints I have (and they are minor) is (1) the keyboard has taken some getting used to, and (2) Front Row performs surprisingly sluggishly. On the second point, since all other applications have performed near-flawlessly, I will assume Apple still has some work to do on Front Row.

From a business standpoint, using Office and QuickBooks on the Mac, and having the ability to load Parallels to run Windows if I encounter an application not native for the Mac), means I can operate in a largely Windows world without having to worry about viruses, malware, etc. (at least, for now).
Ok, I have used my Macbook for about 6 months now and here are the pros and the cons of this notebook.

Pros:

-Booting time is fast, all universal binary software funs much faster

-Excellent design, bright screen, nice keyboard layout (very comfortable), compact.

-Tiger OS X, one of the most friendly and powerful OS. The navigation and layout is smooth and very easy to work with especially when you have several applications open. (Expose is brilliant)

-Slot loading optical drive, loads of customization availble in OS X preference, Photo Booth (fun to mess around with) and very quiet.

-Rosetta does a good job of running non-universal binary softwares, especially Photoshop and Word.

-Two finger scroll (finally!)

-Widgets (lots of useful widgets out there to help your workflow productivity)

Cons

-After you shutdown, as others have mentions, it won't reboot and locks up (I have to use a quarter to unlock and to take the battery out and reboot)

-Battery life is not great... about 3 hours I believe... expected much more for such a small laptop although you may be able to juice more power if you can keep wifi and brightness down...

-No right click button from the touch pad

-Sometimes Photoshop would crash (never had this problem with my G5 iMac) so save your work frequently just in case and it's a good habit

-The macbook gets dirty rather quickly especially where your hand rests on the restpad.. you'll start to notice yellow residue... try to clean it often if possible I guess...

Some advice... get more RAM.. lots of non-universal binary seems to run better with more RAM... the 512MB I believe is absolutely the minimum requirement and 1GB is ideal or max it out if you can afford it

Save your work often in case the non-universal binary software might crash on you

Battery life isn't great so carry your charger... it's very compact and will pretty much fit anywhere without being a burden

Overall about 4 stars and I think it'll get much better once all software becomes universal binary... it's still better than the Dell I use to own and I would purchase it again if I could.
This my firsrt apple computer and my overall impression is that it is convinient and user friendly laptop. The other laptop that I have is a thinkpad T42. Macbook seems quiter compared to T42. The body of T42, however, seems more sturdy. The thing that I liked most on macbook is the Mac OS. The GUI of OS is very intuitive and since the backend is unix, it provides best of both (unix abd gui) worlds.

However, I have one major complaint against this laptop (reason for 3 stars). The body of laptop heats up excessively to the point of discomfort in keeping it in lap. I have seen several threads on various forums discussing this issue and it seems common rather than exceptions in macbook. I really miss my thinkpad for this one reason.
I enterered the Mac world last January when I purchased a Mac Mini (with the PPC chip) for family use. I like it very much. This July was time to upgrade my laptop computer, and I was facing a dilemma, as I need some Windows only applications (basically Access databases) in my job. Then Apple unveiled the Boot Camp solution, and a couple of days after that Paralells launched a wonderful apllication called Paralell's Desktop for Mac (a US$ 50 investment) that allows Windows to run inside the Mac OS environment, so I dont't need to face the dual booting hassles. Voil! Now I'm a very satisfied MacBook owner, using Mac OS applications most of the time, and switching  to Windows almost seamlessly, when I need to. My MacBook is the low end model, with memory upgraded to 1 GB (This is an upgrade I stronly recommended) . The performance is great using the Mac OS and very good using Windows (the only perceivable delays are related to file management chores, like opening and saving files; when I run Excel macros and generate Access reports in medium size databases the performance is amazing). I haven't faced the problems related to noise that were reported by many users, but the heat at the bottom of the computer makes operating it on my lap very unconfortable. The glossy screen is very confortable, with great colors. I haven't  played with the remote control/Front Row application, so I can't comment about it. For practical reasons I'd rather prefer the black body, but I didn't want to spend the extra money. This computer is a small wonder, and for US$ 1.200 (with 1 GB) is a great value.  Go for it!
This is my first new computer in 10 years and it's the one to get. I've built a website , made movies, all kinds of great programs that come right on the Mac. It's so easy to use and figure out, and the help programs are excellent, the computer will tell you how to use it. The built in camera is high def and Macs are very artist friendly with their great graphics and creative programs, it's all one needs. The size and product design is sleek and minimalistic, almost Swedish :) This computer IS the future, period.
I had read quite a bit about the new Intel MacBooks, but was really blown away by the reality of the one we brought as a graduation present for our daughter. It is beautiful for the eyes, and to the touch, and even its size and heft are perfect. It set up in minutes, connected to our home wirless network and flawlessly downloaded updates to the operating system and to MicroSoft Office, which I bought separately. The glossly screen does not provide the glare I feared it might. Instead it makes the colors deep and vibrant. I have not had any issues adjusting to the keyboard, nor has she. It is a fun, friendly and very useful little machine. We've had it for three weeks now, and I want one for myself!
I love my macbook! It is just amazing, i had a couple of monts deciding which laptop i should buy. A mac was not in my list, but when the macbook came out I know it was just perfect, great price AMAZING features.

So well i picked the 1.83 model, it has everything you may need and more, iLife, totally useful, photo booth to entertain yourself a lil bit and front row! front row is awesomei tlet you see all your pictures, videos, dvds, etc. And using it is just amazing, it feels like using your iPod!!

The mag safe power conector is awesome,luckily  my mac has not been threated by any fall, but knowing it won't go flying is really cool.

Mac os x its just really intuitive, i had never use a mac before and i thought it would be a little though at first,but none of that! the next day i had all my info in my mac!!

This computer its beautiful, inside and out, the apple logo in the front looks georgeus when its illuminated.

I would have just like it had a super drive and not a combo drive:( but well it cant be perfect!

The only issue is that the computer runs extremely hot!! specially on the bottom, its not like some people say that you can not even touch, you can use it perfectly, but i would recommed you to use it in your lap.

In conclusion, I think this is the better laptop i could have bought! i simply love it!!
I'm not a computer expert, so this review is for average users like myself.

This is my first time using Apple, but it was easy to get up and on the Internet. I found out that the delete key will let you page backwards. If you click the apple on the toolbar you can tweak some settings under "systems preferences". I changed the trackpad settings under "keyboard and mouse" to add dragging and took off "ignore accidental trackpad input". I had to change them back because my cursor would jump around when I was writing emails. I did add clicking to the trackpad input with no problems.

I easily added 2 gig of ram. I bought it from new egg for $176 gskill brand 20-231-066. I used a precision screwdriver size 00 to loosen the 3 phillips head screws. You don't remove the screws from the L-shaped bracket, just loosen them. When you push the memory in far enough (and it takes a little force) the levers will have some resistance. When replacing the bracket, there is a notch on the short side  so put it in first. When you've done that, click the Apple on the toolbar and click "about this Mac" and your new memory should show up.

I then downloaded Aspyr's game agent to find out what games my system can play. To my surprise, the game agent says that I have 256 mb of video memory, not the 64 that I expected to see. I checked Intel's website to read up on the GMA 950 and wasn't enlightened much, but it did seem like the GMA 950 could increase the memory if resources were available. It also said that it's upgradeable. Perhaps someone more sophisticated in computers can explain this in a later review! The game agent also said it wasn't sure which games would run with an Intel chip, so I will just read the game reviews to find out what works. Aspyr also said I have 37gb available on the hard drive. I haven't added any other programs yet, so I guess the operating system must take quite a bit. If I ever need more, I'll probably just get something external.

I'm in my 40's and was afraid that the 13.3 inch screen would be too small for me to read. All I had to do was to increase the font size. To do this, click on "View" on the toolbar and click on "make text bigger". Most websites still look good that way. Since I also have vision problems I was afraid the bright screen would have too much glare. I did adjust the brightness down some and there is no problem with glare or reflections.

After 12 years of using Windows, I'm still feeling my way around with this, but I think I'll like it. It was nice not having to take AOL and a lot of other junk off for once and that made this a 5 star computer!

Update 12/30/2006
Dang, I love this thing!  It's got all my pictures in it now. I thought I'd never use Itunes, but I just bought a Shuffle (Gen 2) and now it's got all my favorite music in it, too. I've never had to send it for repairs, because Apple fixed minor problems with their updates as they occurred. I can relax on the sofa, while I'm using this, and it even keeps me warm on these frosty nights! ; )

This is so easy and fun to use that I'm using it for much more than just browsing the web. I love it, love it, love it!
To get the negatives out of the way:  The Macbook gets hot.  This is rather unfortunate as it fits great while resting on your knee or in your lap.  If someone is looking for a true 'laptop' I would recommend something on the PC side with the Pentium M processor as they are just warm to the touch.  Another issue is with the potential whine from the processor 'idleing'.  There are work arounds however that strangely fix the issue.  Hopefully this will be a firmware fix in the future.  Also the Macbook does indeed 'moo'.  With that said it doesn't bother me as I understand the what is going on.  Basically everytime you hear a 'moo' that's the fan under the hood blowing some air on the processor to keep it at a certain temperature.  Preferably I think many people would rather have the fans running at a low but constant speed so as to keep the Macbook cooler.

Ok so now onto the positives and why the base model Macbook receives five stars:
Power!  First off I must say that I have upgraded the ram to 1.25 gb.  The stock 512 is ok but you'll find it sloggy after opening a couple of apps.  Running a couple of non-scientific tests I feel the Macbook for non-GPU related tasks is just as fast as my dual processor 2ghz Powermac G5.  The Macbook feels faster in day to day tasks like internet browsing and even under Final Cut Pro.  The Intel Core Duo chip is a gem of a processor. After finally getting the screen calibrated properly (out of the box it has a pinkish tint) I have to say glare is a non-issue and that overall it's quite beautifull.  Better than the glossy screens I've seen on other low-end PC notebooks.
Of course the software suite that comes with the Macbook is excellent.  I don't think a lot has been mentioned about Front Row.  Put simply it's a lot of fun, easy to use and I love the remote.  It's great for showing content to people and in my opinion adds a lot of value.  For color correction and cropping iPhoto is almost a Photoshop replacement for a casual user.  Speaking of Photoshop, it's important to note that it is not universal yet.  I find it tends to run slow but it's useable.

So if you need a new 'portable' Mac or are considering the switch then I think the Macbook is an excellent value for the power.
I love this laptop. It has great features, it's small and lightweight, and it looks amazing. However there definetly are some things I do not like

- it gets very hott

- the mooing noise of the fans can get VERY annoying

- battery life w/wireless on is only around 3 hrs

- 512 RAM is not enough

- 60 gig is not enough

For the same price in a pc laptop you could get a laptop that is probably faster and has around a 100 gig hard drive. However for me overall it is worth extra money because i love all the software that mac comes with, i love the quality of macs, and i love that it can dual boot windows and mac. Overall it is a good laptop w/some flaws.
My first notebook, but not my first Mac. I couldn't be happier. Wasn't sure if giving up my G5 for this MacBook would pay off given the smaller screen. However, this  high definition glossy screen is even better than the G5, and the 17" screen on my G5 wasn't big enough to fully show 2 programs side by side anyway.

  Mine is also whisper quiet, fast, and the keyboard is a dream. Heat not worth complaining about. I agree, better to have whisper quiet than loud fans.

My MacBook would have taken a few spills already had it not been for the magsafe power cord. And did I mention the built in bluetooth makes going wireless so easy for a non computer geek like myself?

My only complaint is the low volume from the speakers. For such a dream machine, I don't know why Apple didn't give us more volume!!! Surely the next gen will have better volume.

  Even my PC friends think this is an awesome machine.

  Don't wait a minute longer to order yours. You won't regret it!
I am a longtime Apple user, having owned a variety Apple's going all the way back to the Apple II+. In all these years I've had mostly great experiences with my Macs. The MacBook is no exception. As was the case with my last Apple, a PowerBook G4, my MacBook was charged and worked right out of the box. I'm certain that the new Mac user will appreciate the ease with which one can use a new Mac.

I ordered the glossy screen and am glad that I did as everything on the screen is so crisp, and well, glossy!

I would strongly recommend an upgrade of RAM to the 2GB limit. I found a great deal online for $150. While I was already extremely impressed with the MacBook's lightning quick speed at 512, I was  blown away by the additional speed with the 2GB memory.

Like many others, I work at a company with a Windows XP environment. I ordered and installed XP on my Mac. I paid a little extra money and went with Parallels instead of Bootcamp. I appreciate the ability to toggle between XP and Mac OS. The speed of XP in Parallels is very fast, even faster with the 2GB RAM.

I only have two issues with my MacBook. Both problems are those that have been discussed on various Mac support sites. The first is my somewhat annoying 'squishy' mouse button. While it works fine, it doesn't really click on the right side. Numerous people have reported this and exchanged their Macbooks within the return window. The second problem is one that might freak out novices or those unfamiliar with the MAC OS. On a few occasions my MacBook has started up with a colored vertical lines. I simply restarted my MacBook and reset the PRAM. This problem has something to do with one of the software updates. Since I last updated my software, I have not encountered this problem.

One other recommendation that I would make is to spend a little more and get additional harddrive space, especially if you plan on running Windows XP on your Mac. You'll find that the 60GB hard drive may not be enough.
This is my first time having a mac computer. I thought that it would take a while to get used to the transition, not at all! It was so easy, it is much easier than a PC. There is no pressing the start button and going to programs. You can put all of the programs on your dock where they are easily accessible. Finding stuff is so much easier to. With the Mac search bar it finds the things that you are looking for just as fast as you can type them. The battery life averages around 4 hours which is enough for me. This is the best computer that I have ever had. I strongly reccomend it. And if you are worried about not being able to use some of the windows applications, apple offers a program that lets you put Windows XP onto your mac computer. So really it is like two computers in one. AWESOME!
I started getting random power downs on the new one...only a month after I got it. It's been fine until last week when it started to shut down without any warning.  I was just surfing the net and suddenly the screen went blank. At first I thought the system went to sleep mode - but actually it was totally dead. The shutdown happens once or twice daily now, usually right after the system is turned on for the first time. It is not a RAM issue since I tested with other RAM and the same thing happened.

I called Apple support but there seem to be no definite fix yet. In the mean time, it looks like logic board replacement is the only choice.  Currently nothing important can go on this machine because it is unstable. It's merely for net surfing. That is unacceptable.

UPDATE: It took 2 weeks for the repair to be completed due to out of stock part (heatsink) etc.  When the unit finally came back, it was damaged (nasty scratches on top & bottom) and it had to go back for another repair to get the external casing replaced. Total repair time was THREE weeks. Totally unacceptable.
First, don't let the specs fool you--this thing is quick.  I upgraded from a 12" Powerbook G4 1.5Ghz to the white Intel dual-core 2.0Ghz Macbook and it's a screamer.  I haven't found a need to upgrade the ram (yet!) either.

Also, I was hesitent about the MacBook because of the integrated graphics card--well, it plays Call of Duty at 30-40fps at 1024x768 w/out a problem.  Granted it's not an ATI/nVidia card, but this computer can hold its own w/ graphics performance.

Pros:

- Battery life is nice and long

- Great keyboard

- Bluetooth / WiFi (better Wifi reception than my Powerbook had)

- Super quiet... I never really know it's on unless I put a CD in the drive

- Build quality is quite good.  Very solid and sturdy

- Clear, bright screen.

Cons:

- When running on AC power, it does and will get warm.  Put it on a desk.

- No modem, but in almost 3 yrs w/ a laptop, I've only used a modem twice.

I work full-time and take classes in the mornings and on weekends--the battery life will be much apprciated next Fall, as well as the range of features this little thing has.  It's a little bigger than what I was used to, but have found it to be a good, comfortable size for me.

I use both both PC and Mac and happily own an HP Pavilion ZV6000 desktop replacement.

Which do I prefer?  Both.  I use my PC for gaming and occasionally for school, and my Mac is my daily driver.  Use what works for you, but to tell the truth, I've found that working on Mac for long periods of time doesn't give you that "fatigue" you get from sitting in front of a computer for a long while.

Macs require much less knowledge on how to use a computer, in order to use it.  PCs require more knowledge of things like "defragging" and "drivers".  Granted, Microsoft has done an excellent job of making Windows more and more user-friendly, it still misses the mark that sells--make it easy and less complicated, and I think Apple has done a good job of sticking w/ that.
I have been a PC user for over a decade. I got so bored of it and so decided to try the Macbook. All worked great for first two weeks and then I decide to try playing a DVD for the first time. Found a few scratches on the disc... and decided to try another disc and the same result.

Finally took it to an Apple store to get a replacement but they instead offered repair service because it was 18 days instead of 14days. The store Rep's were rude and arrogant and very strict about their policies. Ofcourse, the problem existed all along because I found this during the first DVD use. They promised 5 days service... but its already 4 days and the website says "On Hold" because parts are on order. I find the same rudeness with the reps on the phone.

I like the Mac though but just the product quality and customer service has prompted me to downgrade the rating.
Having never used Apple computers, I was hesitant to make this purchase initially. However, I was a fan of their iPod technology (owning four.) On a trip to Chicago I visited the Apple Store and was able to test the new MacBook. I was looking for assistance with organizing digital photos and movies and the Apple included this in its basic package. I did choose the SuperDrive upgrade and choose to double the memory as I loaded the Windows dual platform on the system. Funny thing though, we haven't used the windows side yet. The wi-fi connections are strong, the Ichat is a neat tool, and the i-photo options offer so many choices that we'll spend many hours learning more of its capability.

Overall an outstanding piece of technology. A superb screen view in a light weight package.
I purchased this computer as a replacement for an aging TiBook.  I was very impressed by a couple of things:

1) The screen resolution is actually very similar to the larger screened (but older) TiBook.

2) Upgrading the memory and hard drive are a piece of cake.  If you've seen any of the videos on the Internet of users upgrading this machine, yes, it's that easy.

I've found the quality to be very good, and I'm very pleased with my purchase.
I am a first-time Mac user, and I must say, I have very mixed feelings about this product.

Setting it up was a breeze, even for such an un-techie like me ;) I was online right away , and everything just WORKED (at first). But then I went to my favorite game website and tried to run something while I had other apps open, and everything seemed like it was in slooow....mooootioooonnnn until I closed some other apps. Word runs really slowly too, whether you have other things open or not. But besides that, everything runs smoothly, and it's FAST too.

The Macbook is by far one of the most aesthetically pleasing laptops out there on the market. Everything is sleek and shiny (except the matte finish on the keyboard and palm rests), and the glossy screen makes everything look sharp and color-drenched. It's just over an inch thick, but it IS heavier than one would expect.

BUT all the rumors you've heard about it are true. Just after one and a half weeks of use, the palm rests are starting to yellow and age prematurely. And I'd even taken the precaution of washing my hands before using it. Now my new pristine white and gray latpop is soiled, and it won't come off, either. :( It also heats up to unbearable temps. Everytime I want to surf the web in bed, I have to either wear long pants or put a blanket on my legs. I can't stand the heat on my bare legs; it BURNS. The trackpad randomly freezes, too. Usually it'll be when I'm typing, but sometimes it takes a few seconds for me to get any response from my trackpad.

Even though the Macbook has many flaws, I'd recommend this laptop to anyone. But you'd better wait 'til all the flaws are fixed before you drop any money on it.
Love this notebook, however the hard disk died after two days. It is being replaced by Apple.
Simply the best laptop you can buy....PERIOD.

I've been a Windows user for over 16 years and this is the first MacBook I have ever purchased. After waiting, scrimping, saving and begging, I finally got one. I can't describe how happy I am with this laptop. It simply works...it does what it is supposed to do and it does it very well. There is nothing I miss about a Windows laptop, not one single thing. I admit, the applications, like Pages (word processing) and stuff take a little getting used to, but that is to be expected.

I do admit, being in the field that I'm in, I will HAVE to get another Windows based laptop sooner or later, but I can tell you it will only be for work. This MackBook is going to be the primary laptop for years and years to come. My next laptop/PC will be a Mac, the next computer I recommend for family and friends is going to be a Mac. Apple has a new fan, simply for creating a product that does what it is supposed to do. It's very refreshing to have that for a change. Thank you Apple.

If you are in the fence about getting an Apple product, do yourself a favor and get it, trust me, you won't be sorry.
Unfortunately I disregarded the comments re the overheating of this specific product. I have had my Pro for going on 3 weeks and I must admit that it has been a disappointment. Apart from overheating it stutters when playing music videos. This machine is also quite slow, for the spec I truly expected more horsepower!
I believe that a recall will be imminent as this is not too good as a product!
This is my first Mac, and if this is the quality of the Apple kit - then whats all the hype about?  Back to Ubuntu and more suitable hardware for me methinks!
For me this is an upgrade from an already well loved MacBook Aluminum 2.4 GHz / 6 GB / 240 GB SSD. Apple makes the finest notebooks in the industry, period. The current aluminum design is a functional work of art. The glass track pad and screen are a joy to use. Plastic PC notebooks feel like junk after using one of these. And performance is top notch.

What's different from my old MacBook?

* I'm seeing about a 1.5x-2x speed boost. This thing screams with my SSD which I moved from the old MacBook. Hint: these MacBook Pros need a newer build of 10.6.6. The included DVD will update a drive with an older version while leaving all your stuff intact. Make a backup just in case before transferring.

* I love finally having FireWire. I keep a large photo collection on an external 2 TB drive and FireWire really improved file open/save times in Photoshop. I can't wait to see Thunderbolt drives and eSATA adapters.

* The battery life is excellent. I don't doubt Apple's 7 hour estimate for web browsing. For me working away from an outlet, often with VMWare Fusion running, it looks like I'll be able to get a solid 5 hours.

* Windows XP and 7 in VMWare Fusion also scream on this notebook. Windows 7 runs faster on my MacBook Pro than on my neighbor's quad core machine, and he also has a SSD. That's quite a testament to the i7 on the Sandy Bridge chipset.

* This MacBook Pro is consistently running about 10-15C cooler than my old one. I use smcFanControl so that I can better keep things cool with the computer on my lap. It helped with the old, but I'm not sure I even need it with the new.

* I didn't care about the SD card slot (my cameras all use CF) until it dawned on me that it would make a good secondary storage on the road. When you're trying to live with a smaller SSD an extra 32 or 64 GB is nothing to sneeze at even if it's slower storage. That's fine for documentation and infrequently used files.

Complaints? I really can't think of any. Obviously a gamer would want one of the larger models with the discrete GPU. But I'll take the light weight and portability of this model any day.

I highly recommend this notebook. And if you can swing it I also recommend getting a 3rd party SSD. (Apple's prices are a bit high for the SSD option.)
This is my first Mac in my 15 years of IT life. My requirements were 12" or 13" screen, lightweight, good battery life, and should look beautiful. I am a Software Engineer and do a lot of photography, and sometimes make videos too. So I needed a laptop which has high performance, good battery life, and a beautiful design.

I was considering Macbook Air, Macbook Pro, and new VAIO Z for a month, and decided to get this Macbook Pro 2011. The price on Amazon was pretty good. This Amazon price (discounted & no tax) was actually better than the student price after tax. I decided to get an Macbook Pro with core i7 2.7Ghz since I cannot use nice CPU for Air (it is limited), and I had been using 3 VAIO models (SR, SZ, Z) laptop for last 3 years so wanted to try Mac. I am very pleased with my purchase.

I love the user interface most, the speed, and battery life although it took me little time to get used to my first mac. The new core i7 is really fast, and I upgraded the ram from 4gb to 8gb to use Parallels faster. Backlit keyboard is so beautiful, and multi-touch trackpad is super convenient. Two fingers with all-way scrolls, and three fingers with browsing back and forward.

I would say this Macbook Pro (lighter than 2010 version) is the best laptop for me so far over my former experience with VAIO, HP, Compaq, Acer, Samsung, Netbooks, and etc. Someone complained about heating problems, but I don't feel like that. This amount of heat is much better than HP, Compaq, and better than VAIO.

If you don't need super fast laptop, I recommend you a basic model of Macbook Pro. Your main usage is web surfing and documenting, I recommend you to get a Macbook Air. If you never used Mac, I strongly recommend you to experience it. BTW, when you buy a Mac, get a basic model if it is possible and upgrade it. It will save you a lot of money. I upgraded RAM by myself, and will upgrade HDD to SSD soon. I can't wait to use SATA III SSD on my MBP!
This laptop has serious overheating problems. And not just the particular laptop I bought, it seems: just search for this issue on the internet and you will be surprised. For mild usage such as web browsing, emailing, etc. it's just fine. But I started noticing using Google Earth in street mode (I'm not even trying to game with it) that the fan was going crazy and the laptop was getting extremely hot (especially at the back bottom). I then found lots of blogs explaining the same issue. It has been mentioned that perhaps the amount of insulation around the processor is not adequate, or even the manufacturing fan settings. I wouldn't be surprised if this ends up in a recall. It should: I really expect a lot better than this from Apple.
I went looking for a new laptop.  My requirements were 13" Screen, backlit keyboard and 8+ hours of advertised battery life.  I have always been a PC user and do IT support for a living.  This is my first Mac and I am very pleased with it so far.  While the OS is a learning curve the hardware is plain awesome.  The new core i7 processor is blazing fast.  I'm able to run 2 Virtual machines which keeps my gets me my Microsoft fix without even having to reboot.  Backlit keyboard is everything I hoped it would be and the battery lasts a solid 6 hours which isn't bad for the advertised 7 hours of wireless surfing.
I have been on a MacBook C2D 2.4 Ghz (with 6GB RAM) for the last 3 years and wanted to upgrade and the MB Air seemed to be the right way to go. Selling the iPad and the MacBook and getting the Air 13" w/ 4GB RAM and the 256GB SSD, to be precise. At the Apple store I realized the the MacBook Air (at this time) is really older technology in an amazing form factor, but I did not feel compelled to spend $1800 on pretty much the same CPU as I just had for 3 years already. Then the new MB Pro showed up, and after 72h with it I am super happy.

This MBPro with the new i7 2.7 Ghz CPU is about twice as fast as the 2008 MacBook I had. It scored 6800 points on Geekbench. Installing Office Mac 2011 and Adobe CS3 was super fast and I look forward to have VMWare Fusion running much better than on the older MacBook. I just watched the full iPad2 keynote (1h) over wireless on battery plus 1 hour of surfing, battery says 4h left, awesome! I already swapped the hard drive for a 320GB/7200 and in 6-12 month I might go SSD, but for now I stay with regular disks. There are some great 750GB /7200rpm drives now for about $100.

It's slick. I love the illuminated keyboard, finally on the smaller pro machine. The trackpad is awesome. The new LED screen is super crisp and bright. The new graphics HD 3000 chip is pretty good and enough for light Photoshop work. I can only recommend it. If you think MBP 13", go for the fastest CPU like this one (2.7 i7) and get all the rest of the upgrades later. Additional RAM is cheap these days and better HDD and soon the prices for the SSD will come down as well. Swapping the hard drive is easy and the same as will all the Pro models of the last 2 years or so. I can't wait to put like 500GB of SSD into this in 1-2 years and have it fly... Love this machine, best Mac ever (after PowerBook and 2 MacBooks).
I am a long time PC user that has gradually migrated over to being a Mac fan.  This review is not really technical but instead general observations I've had changing from PC to Mac and some things I ran into along the way.

It all started with an iPod touch and finally sold me on Mac after having an iPad for the last six months.  So when my old HP started giving troubles after nearly six years I decided to break down and try a Mac. But I decided to wait for the 2011 version to hit the stores before I made my investment. Two days ago they were announced so I found myself in Best Buy earlier this evening.  I spent some time chatting with a very nice Apple rep in our Greenville, SC store named Bobby.  The store didn't even have them on the shelves yet but he made sure I got one from the high racks where they were stored.

I asked things like would it work with my existing flash hard drive, is the wireless N compatible with my old G router, can I upgrade the memory and hard drive later. I was pleasantly surprised with a yes on all accounts!

The thing that got my attention was that he says the hard drive can be upgraded to solid state drive (SSD) later on...when the prices for those become more reasonable.  At first I thought about getting the SSD but the amount of memory I wanted didn't justify the added price so I got the SATA instead.  I also thought about the 750GB drive but ended up with the 500GB and will opt for an external drive later. The memory is also upgradable to 8GB later as well...not a hard DIY fix.

So I've been playing with my shiny new toy all evening. When I opened up the box and started going through the initial setup I got a little frustrated because, being a PC user, I didn't know the track pad actually clicks!  So I went through the menus with tab and what I discovered to be the spacebar for enter.  It didn't take me very long to figure out how to change the track pad settings to work with a light touch to single click instead of physically clicking the pad button. Hint:  go for the settings gears icon along the bottom first.

I also didn't like the name that got selected for my home folder during the initial setup. (I clicked through it a little too fast...). To change this I just went in the users and made a new profile that was admin, logged off, logged on as new, and then deleted the old one. Of course I had to make my track pad settings again.

Google mail, calendar, and contacts were a breeze to set up!

Overall, I am very happy with my purchase. I was worried that it would be hard to learn a new operating system but with a little playing around I think it'tonot too hard to figure out. When you get stuck, hit the Google website and usually you find someone before you had the same questions.

A good place for news and how to guides is the iPhone Blog, Lifehacker, and Make Use Of (look them up on Google).
...and so the discovery continues!
I love it
Fast shipper!,  Excellent value.  Clean, fast computer
I love it! Runs smoothly and has no issues whatsoever. Love the size. Overall a great product.
3.5 years later - this machine is still ticking. Only had to replace a battery and update the OS. Everything else for at home use (including gaming) has been outstanding. One of the best electronics purchases I have ever made!
I LOVE this computer. It does everything I need it to do as a student without Apple's pricey newer models. My favorite part is that it still sports the ethernet slot and disc drive, unlike the new macbook pros.
I bought this for school because my iPad wasn't cutting it anymore, and I love it! Don't let the "old version" in the title fool you. It still has the power of the newest ones (minus the quad core iterations of course). Mine came loaded with 16gb's of ram which is pretty awesome, but I think the others come with 8gb? Either way it has enough power to compete with my two year old iMac which was upgraded like crazy as well. So if you don't feel like spending over a grand on a "new" one, just buy one of the used ones here and you won't regret it.
It's really good purchase
I ordered this with a very cheap price and now still using it. I like Apple products. Good price, good quality.
the laptop was just as described with a few more scratches on the out side of the case, the screen and keyboard look new. The charging unit was another story, looked brand new, still had the protective plastic on it but it failed within in an hour of being plugged in. Not very impressed with it as I cant power the laptop unit I get another.
i used this laptop more than two years, it is still powerful but it's not perfect. it's way better then buying i5 version because i tested that version and it's really disappointing. but this processor is ok. and the older version is better in the graphics card
The computer was exactly as described and more. The 2.7ghz is extremely fast and the battery still lasts. This computer can handle my music recording equipment with ease.
I'm reviewing a MacBook Pro 13 inch (early 2011 model) 4GB ram, intel i7 2.7Ghz, 500GB 5400RPM

My review will be from a different perspective: the computer geek/web developer perspective. This is my first Apple computer I bought in early 2011 and it took some time getting use to. It was recommended from a friend as I was a bit anti-apple at the time. It took me about 3 months to get use to the transition from Windows, but it was well worth it.

Anyway, Mac OSX is built on a UNIX platform and if anyone knows what UNIX is, then keep reading. Otherwise this review is not for you. When reading forums and reviews, I don't understand how people can say that OSX is a less powerful platform. It has many build in tools that Windows does not have.

SSH- Secure Shell is built in through the Mac's CLI (command line interface). SSH is a command line tool where you can securely log into a remote server and throw commands at it. Windows doesn't have this unless you download a SEPARATE tool (putty). Remember that most of the internet runs on a *nix system. It's more secure and more reliable than Microsoft IIS (which still doesn't support .htaccess!)

SCP- Secure Copy. Same thing except it's a sort of secure FTP. If you're a web developer, you will want to securely copy files to and from a remote server. If on Windows, again try downloading a separate non-built in application (I think putty supports SCP). SCP transmits passwords encrypted while FTP is in the clear plaintext form

TFTP- Trivial File Transfer Protocol. This is the UDP version of FTP. For example, I semi-bricked my home wireless router doing a botched firmware update. The only way to un-brick my router was to TFTP into the router and upload the stock firmware to revive it back to life. This saved me 100 bucks. Windows, eh not sure what I would have to download to get TFTP, or you may have to enable it through control panel? The point is, out of the box, a TFTP client is just a few keystrokes away.

MD5/SHA- MD5 is a hashing algorithm. Lets say you download a big file (a linux distro) and you want to make sure that it's not corrupt. For example, lets say during the download a 1 gets flipped to a 0 which would invalidate the whole install and give you problems down the line. With MD5, you can run the file through OSX's MD5 tool, and have it spit out the hash. Then you compare this hash to the hash on the distro's website. If they match, more then likely your download is not corrupt.

Among other tools not natively enabled on Windows, there is a slew of other reasons to get a Mac. If you're an avid Linux guru, 90% of the commands you're use to in Linux will work on OSX (ls, pwd, cd, rm, chmod, etc.) Now, don't get me wrong, your native linux scripts will not work without modification as some libraries, directories etc are different in OSX.

Like any OS (including Windows) you can virtualize Windows and Linux through VMware or VirtualBox. I virtualized a Ubuntu Server in VirtualBox with no issues, and even some of the trackpad gestures worked too.

I also do college work on this thing. Research outside of the command line is awesome. I can highlight any word in any application and get a definition or a wikipedia dialogue box. I have used Java NetBeans on this without any issue for college (unless I had some sort of infinite loop or complicated recursion problem). Multitasking is awesome if you have multiple desktops enabled (which windows 7 doesn't). You can 4 finger swipe between your desktops. For example, you can have your VM on one desktop, Dreamweaver in another, and the Kindle app on your third desktop. So if you're reading some PHP book, you can easily swipe between without much work.

Battery life and Performance is nice too. Never had my Mac crash (unlike my Windows Laptops, I think due to buggy drivers). Battery life is awesome. With the screen/keyboard brightness all the way up, doing normal browsing, programming, web design I get about 4 hours of battery from fully charged (even after about 3 years of owing the computer).

The OS works awesome with each upgrade being only $20 (for Mountain Lion from Leopard) or free-99 for Mavericks (the newest one). I'm sure other reviewers already commented on the OS being great especially with the integration of the "cloud" with other Apple devices. The drawback is that they suck you into their ecosystem, but hey it works flawlessly. I own this MacBook Pro, a iPhone 4S, iPad 2, iPad Mini (installed as a stereo in my car), and soon to be Macbook Air. Everything I do on one, will push to the other devices if it's a contact, calendar, bookmark, etc. But the OS works, hiding all the complicated stuff from you. But if you need to get into the complicated stuff, you can VIM your way into config files if needed.

As I mentioned before, stability is awesome. I can run many Adobe Applications and a Linux VM without concern. I think the reason for stability is that Apple knows exactly what hardware goes into their products, which minimizes driver issues like I've had on Windows. They have specific hardware go into their computers knowing exactly how to ensure the OS can handle them.

The bad. Eh my display went coo-coo under 3 years. So I found an App in the Appstore that turns my display red. Otherwise the display looks all crazy with pink moving pixles. I've googled the problem with little results so I'm guessing I've dropped my computer one too many times and a display ribbon is loose. But the red color makes my computer usable for normal browsing, but web design and photo editing are a bit botched. Hooking this up to an HDMI display solves the issue (and I've ordered a MacBook Air).

Also, there is no dedicated bitmap image editing app (even in the app store). For fast and easy edits (like in Microsoft Paint), I'm using Photoshop which is overkill for some things. On the other hand, everything else is provided with the Mac.

The bottom line. If you're doing any sort of media like photo/video editing, web design, DJing, web server maintenance, then get a Mac. Many server command line tools are built in (just like the Linux Terminal) If you're into gaming, then go with Windows but I have seen many more games being ported to Mac with good results.

I know many people will probably not read this review as this is an older computer. But if you're looking to save money, the MBP Early 2011 model still does a lot for it being in the year 2014. Post any comments or questions below.

this company is a little bad with communiation esp on their website. I wanted to return this computer because it would shut off with the power cord came out a return had a restocking fee of 10% or $90 so i would only get $800 for something that was sent to me defective. Paying to have it shipped back to them ($50) in hopes they can fix the problem.
So far i like the computer when it is working, but I don't like dealing with this company.
Since Apple is Phasing out the in board Optical drive I got a used one.
I have too many DVD/CD's to view and don't want to deal with an extra component.
On the other hand, no Opt Drv means less to go wrong and less repair.
I've had this laptop since march 2011 and it has worked perfectly. Sadly it overheats from time to time, but this can be fixed using smcFanControl which lowers the temperature very fast. Another issue I encountered is that two years after I bought this computer, the adhesive pads from the base of the laptop fell and so I had to get some industrial glue to stick them back; I believe this happened as a result of overheating. Other than that I've no complaint at all. The aluminium carcass still looks new with minor scratches that go unnoticed.
Bought this MAC a couple years back, and I'm still amazed at how smart of a decision it was for me to buy one. It's simple folks, once you go MAC, you don't go BACK. Durable, reliable, battery life = forever (almost), ease of use...just do yourself a favor and buy one.
It came in perfect packaging from seller. Pristine condition. I thought it would be too small after having a 15" but it's cuter and easier to transport. I was able to load my old files from Time machine in about an hour. I've used it for day to day stuff, made some short videos with the isight camera and iMovie, as well as running a powerpoint presentation for hundreds of people. Very happy.
I have had my Macbook for a year now and I love it! It's the best computer I have ever owned. I've owned two dell models and spent $1200 on an upgraded hp, but wish I would have spent the money on a Mac years ago.
i ordered this product and after receiving the product and shipping it to a different country i found out that there is a dead pixel in the screen. and the warranty was voided.
I contacted apple but they didn't provide any useful information via the web or the customer service call.
thats why i rated this store with 1 star and became not so fan about apple for the reason i feel not respected by apple or the store i bought the product from
This was delivered to me in better condition and described. I was planning on getting a used macbook pro and this one was basically new. Perfect!
I have been a long time Windows PC user both at home and work. This is my first Mac and I love it. Even when I put Windows 7 on it, it became the best Windows computer that I have ever owned. I have now fully switched to OSX because it gives me another hour of battery life over Windows. If anything I would say that both OSX and Windows have their strengths and weaknesses but neither one is dramatically better over the other. The one thing that is better is the build quality of this computer. I have been buying top of the line Windows Laptops every year for the past 6 years and this thing blows them out of the water. The absolute best thing is the track-pad, it works so damn good, it's like nothing I have ever experienced. I have learned that Microsoft is also capable of building good track-pads but they let the software be controlled by Synaptics and they are the ones responsible for the crappy performance. Microsoft's touch mice were developed in house and they are just as good as anything that Apple has made but until they get that tech into their laptops Apple will be my only choice for laptops. I love the magnets on the power cord, it makes it really easy to plug it in. I do wish that they had more screen resolutions because I always have it plugged into my 46in TV and it doesn't fill the whole screen only about 95% of it, I'm going to buy an Apple TV and see if it along with Mountain Lion adjust the screen to make it fill out better. I also dislike the fact that I had to buy a $20 program so that I could keep my external hard drives the way they came so that I could transfer stuff easily between OSX and Windows, Apple would rather have you format them into Mac hard drives only. I may sell this one for one of the new 2012 MacBook Pro's or MacBook Air's if they are a lot better then this model. I will also be installing Windows 8 with BootCamp when it is released, just to try it out.
This was my first Mac purchase (let alone MacBook Pro) ever.  Macs weren't windows and they are more expensive than comparably equipped (from a CPU, Memory, HD, etc. perspective) so I had never even considered purchasing one.  My son and I started talking about and looking at the MacBook Pros and he decided to buy one.  He loved his and I got to play with it and see how well it was made.  I still couldn't see me paying what he did for the higher end 15 inch model that he got but the entry level machine I could see, maybe.  Then I found this machine as a "Like new" and it had only 100Mhz less CPU speed than the current higher end 13.3" model and the price was lower than the current entry-level machine with the higher class i7 processor and 400Mhz higher speed.  The HD didn't matter since I was going to replace it with a 750GB 7200 RPM Seagate Momentus XT (hybrid with an 8GB SSD built in to improve performance to near SSD speeds).  I also opted to purchase 8GB of memory for $40.  Now this machine is a very good performer with good onboard graphics. I am playing Skyrim on native resolution (low graphics settings) with acceptable play for me.  Obviously, I have Windows loaded using BootCamp and have also installed Parallels.  This allows me to have very good performance from Office 2010 within MacOS.  Windows games have to be run from BootCamp.  I really love the gestures in Lion and the fact that I can use many of the most used ones in the same way under Windows.  I actually prefer to use Lion but enjoy Windows 7 more than I did on other Windows based machines due to the larger touch pad and the use of gestures that gives me much better control than I have had with any other trackpad device.

Swapping out the HD could have been really tough with a lot of configuring from scratch but with this MacBook Pro, I was able to backup using time machine, swap out the HD, boot the machine from the Internet (using Wi-Fi), restore from time machine, and then install Lion over the top again to create the recovery partition.  The process went smoothly and didn't take any longer than installing Windows, let alone doing a restore.  The last step could have been skipped if I didn't want/need the recovery partition on my internal drive.

This machine is the best built one I have ever seen and I have come to realize that they really hold their value because of that.  In short, this is the best Windows machine I have used and it is even better running MacOS X Lion.
Just in case you are wondering, are Macs really better?
You don't really see the appeal, but if so many people love them, surely there's got to be something to that?
For me - No.

I've had a hate/hate relationship with this since I got it. It's got the most passive aggressive operating system I've ever had the displeasure of using. It's my way or the high way, which leads to ridiculous design decisions like not having folders, which are *navigation items* above files. Fine if you're at home, but I'm actually trying to use it at work, where there is a huge labyrinthine folder system which Finder really can't handle. No really, it cannot find files that inside the folder I am searching, and frequently takes half a minute or longer to display folders with a large number of files.
The only good thing about this, is I'm more familiar with the command line, given that I end up using grep to find everything. Seriously, I use the command line more often than I did on Ubuntu or Debian (Linux distributions).
Then there's the wifi, which frequently thinks it's lost the password to my wifi connection when it's gone to sleep, forcing me to log out and in again, or if I'm lucky, close all browsers and other wifi using programs, turn wifi off, and then on again.
And yes, there are less programs for Macs. And yes, I'm forced into a few apple standards, like Itunes which, well - I hate (should have been a clue for me really).

Finally, while I have a few more complaints, I think the kicker is... It literally causes me pain.

Whose bright idea was it to have an aluminium case? In winter, in a dry climate, it gives me several static shocks a week. Twice a day if I'm particularly unlucky. In that time, while starting a new job, I entertained frequent fantasies about dropping it out my 9th story window.
I've never hated a gadget so much. Our antagonism has diminished, and my venom may seem overblown, but - literal pain. The Finder. In something I end up using for the majority of my day.

In a couple of years, I don't know what laptop I'll get, or what operating system, but I can tell you it won't be a mac. And when this does finally die, and I've scavenged its working parts, I look forward to the satisfaction I will receive from throwing it from a large, large height.
Hello guys, If you opt to buy a macbook online other than the apple store, the best place would be Amazon. It also shipped with OS X Lion.
It's been great! Fun and easy to use once I figured out all the mouse pad tricks! Will never buy other than Apple again.
Bought this book from Amazon because i trust them more than a random reseller. So far, so good and I have no complaint. Apple makes a fine product and even refurbished units work great!
What can you say?  I drank the kool-aid a long time ago.  It's a Mac; you take it out of the box and you use it.  It "just works".
This is my first review on amazon....

This laptop is a real beauty. I received the one with preinstalled OS X Lion....and with Lion and its UNPARALLELED track pad this laptop is class above the rest including Sony Vaio. About the price, I tried to custom build a Vaio with a similar configuration to my Mac and it was nearly the same price with neither the looks nor the features..

I've read about the sub-par graphic card and screen resolution but believe me 1080p movies run without a single pause on this machine. I am not a hard core gamer so I am not sure how it holds upto that challenge. (even otherwise, its no fun playing games on a 13 inch laptop.)

Its pretty light, has a ethernet port and a DVD writer so it serves my purpose better than the lighter Macbook air. My purpose of use the usual net surfing, reading articles/books), for my med school rotations (which on the full screen preview of pdfs is 10000x easier and more wonderful than any other laptop or PC I've use before..) and watching movies and shows while away from my home (which is great with the amazing video and audio quality....)
I get new macbook every 2 years and never had problems with the migration manager. For me,it is very imortant that I can move all my files to the new mac and in this case I am on day 2 and still can not figure it out....even thopugh I am a mac person and I know how to work with it....very well.
I called apple support but they wore useless. I got everything they told me to, I did everything they told me to and there is still no way for the the computers to find eachother....
I called the apple store but I will have to leave both laptops for days in order for them to do it and I can not afford being away from my laptop due to work.
I am getting a feeling that soon Mac will turn in to the new McDonalds, it;s getting too popular and the Apple people are getting too cocky these days....and without Steve Jobs....
Anyway, not recomending this product if you want to transfer your files from an old mac
This was the first MacBook I have ever purchased. I wasn't sure about how it would be to transition from using only a pc my whole life to trying out this alternative. Boy am I glad I switched. The MacBook functions perfectly and quickly. I performed a very unofficial comparison of my new MacBook to my almost identically matched HP PC and the results blew me away, I started them up at the same tIme and was browsing the internet and playing the Sims 3 on my MacBook before the pc even logged in to windows. Overall a great purchase and I will purchase more in the future.
I purchased this computer for my granddaughter, on her way to college.  When she opened it and started "touring", all I heard was "Ooh, thank you Nana!".  That went on for about 4 hours! By the way, I was not able to touch it, before she left for college, but she did tell me she loved everything about it.
It is exactly like what the pic shows. I think I will buy another color later. It is the good one.
Wonderful! If you are thinking of switching to Apple. Don't think twice.
I took 5 years to make up my mind and so far so good. Couldn't be better.

Next purchase for me: an Apple desktop.
I got mine thru the apple website under the refurbs for 1238 saving about 167 dollars versus new. The refurbs bought thru apple are like new, not a scratch on it, same warranty and even came pre installed with lion.
Also was able to purchase apple care for additional 2 yrs. for total of 3 yrs of coverage.
 I am an avid pc users, and work primarily in maya and cs5 and will say this laptop does everything i need it too. I have animated with flash and maya both and not one issue thus far. It is blazing fast. Best screen I have ever seen on a computer perfect for any designers or animators and artist.
The size is perfect as well, 15 inch model comes with video cards but i have found that apple intel 3000hd open gl integrated video on this 13 inch model does just fine, sure the fan may come on once in a while when rendering but never loud or annoying. I would not trade this size. It is easily commutable.
Battery life is exactly as stated actually a little better when I shut off my backlight keyboard n dim my screen it has lasted about 8 almost 9 hrs with normal use, more extensive use like maya or gaming or hd movies will take battery faster obviously. but not enough to be annoying.
Honestly this is the perfect laptop. Os Lion is best OS I have ever used and that is shocking as I loved windows 7 and still do as my desktop at home office is a win7 tower I built at 16gigs of ram, 2.93 ghz i7 processor over clocked to 3.1 and two hd at 500 n 320...as u can see its a beast.
I am not saying this mac is better, or faster, but it has not froze on me once, or caused me to do a restart, and such everything i normally use just works more stable and butter smooth pace.
My pc is still used for large files that need hrs of rendering to be complete as that obviously goes faster on that. But for
my macbook is used 98 percent of the time for everything else, including video editing, photoshop n not just light use. As well as sketchbook pro which is sold thru mac app store much cheaper than any other hard disk version.
So if you are on the fence dotn be and I advise get it thru apple refurb program as it is like new guarenteeed to work and have no flaws. and you save money
I was very impressed with the way it was delivered it was very well insulated. I love the size of the laptop and even the intel video card provides a good clear image although with the 4gb the shared memory was 384mb which is a bit low for it not really all that bad. When i went to the 8gb the shared memory went up the 512mb; with the 8gb and I am very impressed with the speed at which the computer refreshes when i go from having it closed and then opening it. Although even with 4gb it always performed very well.  I am very happy with the purchase. I would have preferred the i7 quad but for $800 less this purchase is definitely worth it.
This is my first mac, I love the touch pad interaction and the possibility to have many desktops. The product looks very robust.
Unless you're planning on seriously breaking into your computer and customizing it to alienware levels, this is the only laptop worth getting. The Mac OS is superior in every aspect from UI (user interface) to organization to performance. Simply put, it's the easiest OS to use and everything "just works" There's hardly a chance of getting any viruses (if you do virus-conducive activities though, ProtectMac AntiVirus is the best). The hardware is excellent too, down to the tiniest details. The backlit keyboard, the glossy display, the light aluminum, it's aesthetics and functionality are perfect. The price is a bit steep, but this will honestly pay for itself in ease of use and longevity. Definitely worth getting over any other laptop out there!
It's by far the best computer I've ever had in my life , though I'm experiencing some problems with Mobileme, for some strange reason I can't seem to set it up.
I had my first MacBook more than two years ago and until now,it never change. The speed is superb and i can open any windows so fast. It helps me a lot in my personal interactive in the internet. When my co-employee ask an advice about this product,i told him to get one of this computer and he does. My previous purchased of MAcBook Pro MC724LL/A 13.3-Inch Laptop is the latest model that Apple has and it is more faster. I recommend this product to anyone who looks for personal computer and my advice is get it from Amazon because they ship any product so fast and the prize is unbeatable. Thank you Amazon.
After one week learning how to use Mac OS X, now i can't use Windows anymore, it's so easy and funny to use Mac OS X. The best OS ever, try it and you will love it. I've istalled Windows 7 in my MacBook too, only to use some Widows based aplications.
I bought this computer for music production only (Logic, Reason, and Ableton Live).  After realizing how much I love Mac computers / operating system, I have transferred all files over from my PC and put the PC up for sale.  I will never buy a PC again....take that to the bank!!!

The new sandy bridge core i5 is screaming fast.  I can't see how a quad core can be much faster for what I'm using this computer for.  Plus the 13" is the sweet size for portability and use.  This computer is also $1,000 cheaper than the 15".  I just don't get why people would buy the 15" or 17" models.  Some claim it's because of the discrete graphics card.  If you are a hardcore gamer, you shouldn't buy a macbook pro period.  Macbook pro's are for creation (music production, photo editing, and video editing / development)....period!!

You could buy the 2011 AND 2012 macbook pro 13" for the same price as the 2011 macbook pro 15".  Keep in mind that the 2011 macbook pro 13" is faster than EVERY macbook pro model from 2010 (technology moves too fast!).  I wouldn't be surprised if this happens again next year, and you will be able to get a quad core in the 13" for $1200.

Warning: Don't get the 13" i7 processor.  Apple has disabled the turbo boost because the computer gets too hot.  The 2.3ghz i5 processor turbo boosts up to 2.9ghz, while the i7 is only 2.7ghz (and supposed to turbo boost to 3.4ghz).  What's the point of having the i7 when you can't turbo boost to 3.4ghz (b/c of being disabled by APPLE)??  Apple should be sued for false advertising, or at least offer the i7 at the same price as the i5.  Save yourself the $300 and have a faster processor!!!!

Also upgrade to 8gb of ram...totally worth it.  It cost me $60 to do this, and then I sold the 4gb stock ram for $30...for a net cost of $30!!!  Apple charges $200 to upgrade the ram for you, which can be done by a middle schooler (watch youtube videos on it).  What a ripoff.  My next upgrade will be an Solid State Drive...once the 256GB drive comes down in price.  Again this is easy to install yourself.
I ordered this laptop directly from Amazon. Shipping was fast, packaging was great. I had the computer for less than a week and I noticed the CAPS button wasn't working properly. You had to be sure to press slowly and right in the center for the button to work, and even then it worked intermittently. Normal typing would not turn the caps on. We took the laptop up to an Apple Repair store where they said the keyboard was faulty. The entire keyboard was replaced under warranty, but I did not get my laptop back for about a week. Upon return all of the keys worked great for about 24 hours. The same problem has returned so it's off to the repair shop again! I'm not sure what's going on, or who's to blame. If this problem would resolve itself I'd be quite happy with this laptop.

Pros:
-Eye catching looks! (I recommend speck covers from Amazon, they fit great!!)
-Great screen!
-AWESOME battery (7-9 hours if you turn the screen brightness down 2-3bars)
-Runs smooth and fast!

Cons:
-Faulty keyboard
-It's a Mac (lol swapping over from a PC isn't the easiest...but it's doable. This isn't really a con, just a learning curve)
-Apple Care & warranty do NOT cover accidents (dell, sony, & hp have great accident coverage, Apple needs to man up)
Muchas gracias, he recibido a satisfaccin el producto en impecable estado como siempre. Muchas gracias por el servicio tan bueno que tienen. Nunca me han quedado mal
been with pc all my life and all i have to say is....ONCE YOU GO MAC YOU WONT GO BACK! (to pc of course)
This is replacing my Black 2007 MacBook.  I knew it was faster but this thing is a beast.  One thing I do is convert .avi files to .m4v files.  It used to take over 2 hours to do this before on a 2 hour movie.  Now it takes 15 minutes.  Backing up Quicken used to take 3 seconds but now it takes maybe a quarter of a second.  I can also be downloading a movie online while I am converting a file at the same time and not burden the processor.  The only current issue is that it poorly supports an external monitor.  I am positive this will be fixed in an upcoming operating system upgrade.  My monitor works but it is not "Apple Easy" to do it...yet.
This is my families 3rd Macbook in the last 2 years. We just love them. Believe me I was a sworn Windows guy,I said I would never buy a Mac. One day my wife came home with a Macbook Pro and I started playing with it a little (when she wasn't around). The more and more I played with it , the more I liked it. Finally my 3 year old Dell wouldn't work right anymore so I sucked it up and bought myself one. Then of course the kids wanted one,that was this one. Very, very little  chance for virus's . They are a little more than normal laptop's but pay the difference. At Amazon it's cheaper than the Apple store for the same thing, I even went into the Apple Store and asked him why and he said he didn't know and he couldn't match the price. Go For It!!!!
Speed wise there is a significant improvement over prior models when loading up applications. Overall I am happy with my purchase and would recommend the i7 processor over the i5 if you use your laptop for more than just email and the internet.

The i7 processor machine gets much warmer when playing video content compared to the last model. This is an observation rather than a complaint.
As a former pc enthusiast I loved every bit of my new macbook pro. I enjoy its portability, speed, stand and rock solid stabilty. Good bye blue screens ...
This latest model Apple 13" MacBook Pro, along with its less-expensive sibling, have already earned solid spots in Amazon's current Top 10 of all laptops sold. Between them, they've also accumulated nearly 100 reviews -- which represent a wide range of experiences and opinions. With that much information already posted, I've decided that I could make better use of your time by offering suggestions on what to watch (& watch-out) for when reading reviews & comments which sometimes may even appear to contradict one-another:

So -- my 1st, and possibly BEST piece of ADVICE is to READ ALL the REVIEWS and COMMENTS before making your selection! For many (if not most) folks purchasing either one of  the MacBook Pro 13" models, $1200 to $1500 will represent a significant investment and a choice you'll likely want to/need to live with for some time -- even if it turns-out to not be the best choice. Even the large number of comments & reviews for these 2 siblings can still be read in under an hour. Since you've bothered to start reading them, please don't stop after only the 1st few, even if they coincidentally happen to support what you were already hoping to hear; often, the "nuggets" which could have the greatest helpful influence on your buying decision won't be the 1st to surface. Often too, the comments posted following a review may turn-out more-helpful than the original review itself.  I suggest that you pay particular attention to those reviews and comments which are based on users' actual hands-on experiences, rather than those which only regurgitate information gathered elsewhere; that way, you're more likely to find valid user experiences that directly relate to how you intend to use your new computer. After more than 20 years selling and servicing Apple products, when I read reviews which in some fashion, claim: "You should just trust me 'cuz I know what's best for you!" -- it's  painfully obvious to me that they usually don't! A variation on this theme is reviewers who claim special insight into some marketing conspiracy whereby Apple intends to fleece the unsuspecting out of their life savings just to ensure Apple's position as the richest corporation in the entire Milky Way! In this instance, a $300 difference between models mostly reflects the BIG difference between OEM costs for Core i5 vs. Core i7 mobile processors, and to a lesser extent -- the hard drives. Please don't let your decision about which model is better for you be contaminated by others' suspicions that Apple is attempting to exploit you. Both as reseller and technical consultant, my goal has always been customer satisfaction. There's just not-enough difference in profit to force any customer to buy more power than they're likely to need over the useful life of their purchase! At the same time, for folks still on-the-fence, I'm unashamed about suggesting that they buy "up" if they can comfortably afford it. Over its useful life, the "extra" $300 would represent 25-cents per day; even so, as you read through these reviews and comments, you WILL find examples where the Core i7 model IS clearly a superior choice for particular tasks. If any of those activities appear on your list of "to-dos' you'll likely be disappointed by the entry model MBP. Particularly, if you plan to make your new MacBook a dual boot machine -- running both Mac OS and Windows -- you'll need a larger drive than the 320GB factory-installed in the base model 13" MBP. In geek terms, installing a larger hard drive in one of these models is trivial (if you have nimble fingers & are good at following directions). However, even the most experienced geeks cannot avoid the many hours needed to migrate or reinstall software and user files onto a replacement drive. That fact alone might make the Core i7/500GB model a more-appropriate choice for some users. Even if something doesn't leap right out at you, there's also some comfort in knowing that your MacBook might more-gracefully handle some tasks which you hadn't envisioned back when you purchased it (just think back to all the apps and tasks you've added along the way, to the computer which you're now replacing because it's too slow & flakey...). It's a disease called "feature-creep" and sooner or later, it afflicts every one of our computers!

 Early in your readings, you'll probably find that your list of Q's is expanding, based on learning 'bout things you hadn't initially considered. Take as many breaks (deep breathing and chai tea) as you need along the way & post questions here or consult with your fave geek or Google, if you need more info or clarification.  Along the way, jot down enough information so that you can quickly refer back to useful posts you read earlier (you will probably want to re-read some of them after additional Q's occur to you). Sadly, there are a few users reporting some really nasty problems which have surfaced early in the use of their new MacBook Pros. The fact that these adverse reports are rare strongly suggests random hardware or software problems which are affecting a small number of users out of thousands; now that these new models have been shipping and sold in large numbers for a few months, you can reasonably expect that Apple has already addressed any significant "gotchas" and goblins which popped-up in early production. Apple's technical support staff are consistently  competent, patient and mostly friendly, too ('less you beat on them) so I encourage the few purchasers who've commented that they're unhappy with the MacBook's performance to contact Apple Support (1-800 APL-CARE) for further assistance finding & fixing the source of their problems. As always, reporting problems to Apple as soon as they surface allows  the greatest number of options for fixing 'em -- 'specially if that means swapping-out that bad-boy 'poota.

Finally, here are some thoughts about extended warranties (aka, AppleCare) for you to consider... Although Apple doesn't currently offer accidental damage coverage option for laptops, AppleCare does include repair and technical support for a full 3 years from original date of purchase, for hardware (obviously) AND Apple-branded software installed on a covered machine. Beyond that, Apple-branded accessories & peripherals (trackpad/keyboard/ mouse/AirPort/Time Machine/external display/remote control/adapters/etc.) -- you get the idea -- are ALSO covered when purchased at the same time or in most instances, within 2 years of the covered computer. However, user-installed upgrades, such as RAM modules and hard drives are NOT covered by either Apple's basic or extended warranties, and Apple may require that such upgrades be removed before equipment is sent-in for service. For everything else, SquareTrade hardware warranties are an excellent option; in my own household, we've covered 'most everything non-Apple we've purchased -- from toasters to toilets -- with SquareTrade warranties which include accidental damage provisions (don't ask). You might even consider purchasing BOTH extended warranties, if you intend to back-up the family van over your MacBook Pro, a week before the extended coverages expire (if so, please send us a postcard from Leavenworth penitentiary, so we'll know how that worked-out for you...).

At the present time, I'm not tracking reviews or comments on any other Apple products for sale on Amazon. However, I have elected to be notified when new comments are posted to this review. I will attempt to respond to all thoughtful comments and questions when that seems appropriate, but I'd prefer to moderate a discussion among Mac owners. I have greatly enjoyed my 20+ years of involvement with the community of Mac users, and -- for the moment -- I welcome the opportunity to give something back.

After may hours of hand wringing and research on Intel HD 3000 integrated graphics, I placed an order. Then, even though I knew it was a mistake, I began reading the amazon reviews. Many reviews mentioned that this MBP was absolutely worthless for playing games and how it overheated. More hand wringing ensued. I didn't want the 15 inch. I had an early 2006 macbook and the 13 inch was just so portable and perfect I couldn't stand going to a 15". Plus the macbook 2006 spoiled me being able to lounge on the couch and play/work/surf/stay connected; lazy wins again.

I have had it for about a week now and I really couldn't be happier. I won't go into all of the cool productivity applications MacOSX come bundled with because if you are thinking of buying one you probably know about them. This little guy knocks them all out. I want to address specifically the gaming and the overheating issues. I have played WoW with near maxed out settings and it looks beautiful. Left for Dead with moderate settings and team fortress 2 with moderate settings. Both with very little trouble. Youtube has a variety of demo's that show Crisis and other higher end games running just fine. Truth is if you like to play games this can do it and pretty darn well. Its no monster gaming PC but I have built several of those over the past 10 years and I have come to the conclusion that being a minimalist is far more appealing than being chained to a giant machine that requires a substation to power. Not to mention the sinking feeling you get as you watch the state of the hardware you bought plummet in value. Conversely, Macs by design are meant to endure longer and retain there value.  The Intel HD 3000 integrated graphics is on par with many entry level discrete video cards; most benchmark sites will confirm this. In addition, they are relatively new and as drivers are perfected and more development companies become more familiar with them, the overall experience should improve. Most people bristle when they hear "integrated graphics"; in my opinion this is not your older brothers integrated  graphics system. The architecture is fundamentally different; I won't go into detail, but Google it if you'd like to understand more.

That leads me into the overheating issue. I used SMC fan control to monitor my old Macbook temp. Did a fine job. I installed it on the new MBP and the first thing I noticed was a dialogue saying that the software wasn't updated to support the new MBP yet but it should work. The readings I got were near double that of what I would get on my old Macbook; ambient and loaded. ~170 F or more loaded. 6300 rpm fan speed reported. At first glance this is OMGHAWT! But I suspect that there are a couple of reasons for this. I have no hard evidence I am simply offering my educated opinion having worked in the technical field for a number of years.
First, the integrated graphics and the Processor are on the same die; they are physically one piece. As a result, the heat sink and fan system have to account for this with their footprint. The heat and fan speeds (and this is a stab in the dark based on other pieces of hardware Ive worked with) are reported via millivolt readings. The SMC fan software (probably) reports based on the millivolt readings. Given that this is the first generation MBP with Intel HD300 integrated graphic (again, different in many sharing respects than previous integrated systems), it is quite possible that the millivolt span changed and the reporting is skewed using the old span. As an example, assume the older macbooks had a span of 0-6mv; 0 being ambient and 6 being fully loaded.  The new macbookpros use a span of 0-10mv. Using the same reporting tool on both spans would result in incorrect readings in the 0-10mv example because at 6 the reporting tool would reflect maximum load temp and maximum fan rpm even though there were 4 more millivolts of span to use. Again, this is my guess.

TLDR version of cooling issues: The MBP after running team fortress2 for 1/2 hour does get warm around the power supply area and you can feel the heat coming from the exhaust ports. Macbooks do run warm and as I understand this is fairly well accepted; but not "we need a recall! its melting!" hot. Its typical in my opinion.

Anyway, I hope this helps people out there like me who were on the fence about what the bottom line is regarding performance and cooling of the item.

Love it love it love it.

***Update 1/25/2012****
Just wanted to check back in and update my experience. Everything is fantastic with the machine. Its still my #1 prized possession. I added a hard clear snap on case, a screen protector film and a keyboard cover here from Amazon to protect my investment. The bottom got a few scratches on it from normal wear so I went ahead and decided to add armor.
Some things I have done this year with it:
1) Manage my Linux server
 -Really all I need is the command terminal, but OSX makes the working in terminal easypeasy.
2) Ive loaded Eclipse Europa and have written some programs in various languages.
3) Added Adium to unify my chat clients
4) Had a lot of fun with photo booth.
5) Got all my Itunes migrated over from My old windows machine and bought a bunch of new ones.
6) Played lots of WoW.
7) Bought Call of Duty Modern Warfare from the App store and am super pleased with the performance of the machine.
8) Bought an OEM copy of Windows 7 and loaded using Bootcamp.
 -What a snap this was. The OSX disk that comes with machine doubles as a automatic drivers loader for Windows 7. Pop it in and it loads all the drivers and monitors when Apple releases updates. It runs Windows 7 as well as Windows 7 can run. Having gotten use to OSX, I honestly can't stand working in it unless I am forced to. I could go on but Ill leave it at that.
9) Bought Star Wars The Old Republic and have been playing on Windows 7 since early release. I get maybe 30fps on avg; dips down to 20 or so in super populated areas and reaches upper 50s at its best. I am very pleased with how it performs.
Coming This Year
-Upgrade to 16g ram; I think this is going to help with graphical performance given the nature of the shared memory architecture.
-Try and really get down and dirty with iMovie, Time Machine, and some of the other applications that came with the machine that I haven't had a chance to use.
-Interested to see where the thunderbolt/PCI video card ideas go.
-Working on my Masters in CS and am I sure that I will have much fun and get an amazing amount of value out of this little guy.

Still 100% happy with it.
This is my first apple laptop, i only had for three months  and i'm still getting used to it, but i'm impress with how smooth it runs and how fast it is. A big difference from my slow pc
this item very nice & also nice packaging. i recomend you to buy this product. but amazon always have tax! sometimes if any cheapest than amazon i take other seller because they not applied tax:)
Old review
Apple has dropped support for Nvidia. The only reason I bought a Mac is to develop CUDA apps and possible iOS. Macbook pro BTW is an engineering marvel. The casing is made of high grade aluminum making it very light and more heat resistant. My only complaint is the new power cable design sits awkward with the other cables. I bought a cool protective case so now the power cable only goes one direction.

Update
Apple is ditching Radeon and going back to Nvidia so I*m adding a star, yey! I was considering OpenCL which was first pioneered by Apple but I*m more familiar with using CUDA. It is quite amazing how other laptop manufacturers have followed Apple*s pioneering design and quality. I*m talking about the Ultrabooks. Thanks to Apple for setting a high standard of design and quality. I would like to buy the MacBook Air as soon as I convince my wife. She doesn*t like how thin the MacBook Air is and thinks it*s flimsy and will break easily.
I've had this laptop for a little over a month now and let me tell you, you will not be disappointed. I bought it from my local Apple retail store and I am very satisfied with my purchase. I will say this though, if you're planning on doing heavy processing, get an iMac.. The MBP is no match for heavy apps. Overall, the MacBook Pro gets an A++ from me!!
Awsome product, awsome price, awsome shipment time - AWSOME!
If you don't have a macbook pro - buy one!
The difference between the two processors in the 13" is not only the frequency because the i7 has the Virtualization Technology while the i5 does NOT.

It's very important for those who use virtual machines and it will have a significant impact on the performance.

For the regular user who doesn't use CPU intensive programs and doesn't need virtual machines then there is no need to pay the extra 300$ .. just buy a good SSD and u will be amazed how fast your applications will launch.
It's well known that these 13" MacBook Pro's don't have a discrete graphics chip but that didn't stop me from buying one anyway.  I was so desperate to switch from my behemoth of a laptop, the 15" MacBook Pro, to the smaller, more portable, 13" MacBook Pro.  I was hoping that despite the lack of a discrete graphics chip, the huge increase in processing power would offset its absence.  Boy was I wrong.

When people mentioned how poorly this laptop fared against other laptops in video game performance, I thought, fine, they're comparing this laptop with the newly released 2011 15" ones with discrete graphics chips.  But what if we compared this laptop to a 3 year old 2008 15" MacBook Pro?  Would the huge upgrade in CPU help the 13" MacBook Pro compete with the older, 15" model?

To my disappointment, it could not.  I ran games like Left 4 Dead 2 and Resident Evil 5 on this MacBook and found them barely playable.  These games ran smoothly on my '08 MacBook.  I was so disappointed I actually considered returning it.  But I didn't when I thought about the hefty 15% restocking fee Amazon charges for opened computers.

On the plus side, 1080p HD video played silky smooth on the 13" MacBook Pro, while on my older '08 15" model it stuttered.  I was really excited to see this as this was evidence of a vastly improved CPU.  The 13" MacBook Pro also has a built-in SD card reader and a unibody construction that my '08 15" model lacked.

By the way, I found it strange this MacBook didn't come with a remote.  My '08 15" model came with one.  I'm not sure if only the 15" ones included remotes or Apple simply stopped including them with all their laptops.
I have the macbook pro 13.3 i7 for 36 hours and is continuously working (downloading, transferring files, testing applications etc) all this time.

There is no overheating problem at all. Actually temperature is much much better than my previous macbook (early 2008) model and the sony vaio I have at work.

The speed is good but not so impressive as described or at least to what I was expecting reading the reviews.

Everything else is as described. Maybe only a bit overpriced compared to i5 model and this is the only reason I give it 4 stars. Maybe in harder work it will prove itself....
I switched from the previous Macbook Pro which I also loved, I had the 13'' 2.4 Duo and I must say the i7 is a MASSIVE performance improvement, for me it's just the best laptop got better.

Hoping that the next 13 pro will have a dedicated graphic card which will make it close to perfect
Let's assume you're confused between buying the "standard" $1199 Macbook Pro 13 and this "high end" $1499 Macbook Pro 13.

I'd like to help in simplifying the decision making process.

This "High end" model is still not a good purchase (with regards to value) when compared to the "standard"&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Apple-MacBook-Pro-MC700LL-A-13-3-Inch-Laptop/dp/B002QQ8H8I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Apple MacBook Pro MC700LL/A 13.3-Inch Laptop</a>

The ONLY differences between the two 2011 MBP 13's are minor and consist of a super small processor speed difference and hard drive space. The standard MBP 13 has a 2.3GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor + a 320 gb 5400 rpm hard drive while the high end MBP 13 has a 2.7GHz dual-core Intel Core i7 processor + a 500 gb hard drive.

For value conscious consumers, I've pasted Speedmark 6.5 and Geekbench results below. Speedmark is Macworld Lab's standard test tool for benchmarking Macs. It's used to test overall speed and efficiency of macs. Geekbench is the most recognized benchmarking software for Mac.

Speedmark 6.5 results:
2011 Macbook Pro 13

13" MacBook Pro 2.3GHz Core i5 dual-core - Score = 140
13" MacBook Pro 2.7GHz Core i7 dual-core - Score = 155

Only 15 points more. Not even a 15% difference.

Geekbench Benchmark results
13" MBP 2.3 GHz dual i5 2011: 5948
13" MBP 2.7 GHz dual i7 2011, 6796

A difference of 848 points - which equals up to a 12% difference.

So you're paying $300 more (20% of the cost of the $1499 MBP 13 or 25% of the cost of the standard $1199 MBP 13) for a 12% difference, a 400 mhz processor speed difference (not at all major in any way as seen in the benchmarks) and a 180 gb hard drive space increase.

EVERYTHING else is is the same in both models, from the 1280 x 800 resolution 13 inch LED screen to the Intel HD 3000 integrated graphics to the Superdrive DVD burner to the Thunderbolt Port,FaceTime HD Camera, backlit keyboard, 4gb ram, two USB 2.0 ports, Wi-fi B/G/N, bluetooth 2.1 and Gigabit ethernet

The software included in both models is the same too, Mac OSX 10.7 "Lion" and the iLife suite of content creation tools. A 1 year warranty on parts and 90 day telephone technical support is also standard on both models

What if you chose to buy the standard MBP 13?

If you did that, you could then buy a 500 gb hard drive&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Western-Digital-Scorpio-Blue-500-GB-Bulk-OEM-Hard-Drive-2-5-Inch-8-MB-Cache-5400-RPM-SATA-II-WD5000BEVT/dp/B001JSSDGU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Western Digital Scorpio Blue 500 GB Bulk/OEM Hard Drive 2.5 Inch, 8 MB Cache, 5400 RPM SATA II WD5000BEVT</a>&nbsp;for $ 55 and install it yourself in your standard MBP 13 which would then have a hard drive just as large as the higher end MBP 13. The installation instructions are included in the MBP 13 manual and it doesn't void the warranty. Installation videos are also available online.

And you'd still have $245 left to buy an&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/AppleCare-Protection-Plan-for-Mac-Laptops-13-Inches-and-Below-NEWEST-VERSION/dp/B004R6J2V6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">AppleCare Protection Plan for Mac Laptops 13 Inches and Below (NEWEST VERSION)</a>&nbsp;or a&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/SquareTrade-3-Year-Laptop-Tablet-Warranty-Plus-Accident-Protection-Laptop-Tablet-1000-1250/dp/B002I007SU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">SquareTrade 3-Year Laptop/Tablet Warranty Plus Accident Protection (Laptop/Tablet $1000-1250)</a>&nbsp;to protect your shiny new MBP 13 for 2 more years after the standard one year warranty is up.

Until Apple actually puts in a major differentiation feature or upgrade in the higher end MBP 13, I'd recommend you shop smart, save your money and opt for the standard&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Apple-MacBook-Pro-MC700LL-A-13-3-Inch-Laptop/dp/B002QQ8H8I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Apple MacBook Pro MC700LL/A 13.3-Inch Laptop</a>. It's 99% identical to the more expensive MBP 13 and a much stronger product when it comes to the value for money factor. And use the rest of the money to buy a warranty and a hard drive upgrade if you feel like.

Hope this helps!

NOTE -  Fellow Amazon customer Diane (Her comment can be seen in the comments section of this review) has spoken to an Apple rep and she had this to say "Even the Apple Rep that I spoke with at the Apple store recommended the MBP 13 as is and said the differences were not worth the extra money. Said the average user would not notice any differences in the 2 units - just cost." Another Amazon customer, Marcin (His comment can be seen in the comments section of this review) said an apple salesperson told him ""We have both on the shelf. But there is no reason to buy i7, you will not see the difference".

Something to think about. Thank you.

UPDATE - Professional review site Notebookcheck.net did a review of both Machines. I've posted the links to the full reviews below as well as summary quotes.

Quote # 1 - referring to the performance difference between the standard and high end MBP 13 - ( link - [...]

"It's also interesting to take a look at how the model at hand measures up to the weaker MacBook Pro 13 version with a Core i5 processor. The less powerful model performs 91% as quickly as the Core i7 model, that is, only slightly slower."

Quote # 2 - Referring to the battery life of the standard MBP 13 ( link - [...]

"The model we're reviewing here trumps the more powerful version of the MBP13 with an 11-16% longer battery life in all test scenarios (note: wifi test results not comparable)"

So the standard&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Apple-MacBook-Pro-MC700LL-A-13-3-Inch-Laptop/dp/B002QQ8H8I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Apple MacBook Pro MC700LL/A 13.3-Inch Laptop</a>&nbsp;has better battery life by 11 to 16%, has 91% of this "higher end" MBP 13's performance ability AND costs 25% less.

Hope this helps!
I've been a Windows user my whole life and decided that I would take the plunge and go with Mac for college. I had played around with OSX on a friend's laptop and it was love at first sight. The Macbook is sleek, compact, and fast.

The wireless connection (Airport) is fully compatible with a, b, and g networks. It works with no problems at home and school.

The Mac looks and works great. Overheating is a problem because it gets too hot to keep on your lap and the fans turn on at full blast.

If you're thinking of buying a Mac, buy it for the OS. It's intuitive, aesthetically pleasing, and fun to use. Personally, I feel the black Macbook is worth the extra $200 since it won't get dirty and need it's front panels (where you rest your wrists) replaced and for the larger hard drive (80GB instead of 60).
What great deal this laptop is! Don't try to use advertised prices of windows laptops. The Macs come with so many features as standard equipment they are not really comparable. iphoto, iTunes, iMovie, iDVD, and garage band allows the average person to use and edit their photo's, video's, music they've bought, and music they've made on their own, and the software is easy to use.

i had a Powerbook G4 and the Intel Macbook blows it away. This is a really fast laptop, and it was easy to add software and content from my old computer to my new powerbook with software included on powerbooks. It walks you through the transfer and using firewire makes it very fast.

Unlike my old G4 the powerbook comes with a glossy screen. It's GREAT. The screen is much brighter, and the colors much more vibrant then the older screens. I was worried about reflections, and yes if you put the sun behind you, you'll have a problem. But in every other situation this a great display.  I used to have problems seeing the screen out on the deck, or in a car (no, not driving) but with the glossy screen it is much easier to work out of doors.

Lastly I think that since Apple has vastly increased system bus speeds, and is using faster memory has contributed to dramatic increase in performance.

Windows people should rest assured switching will be a pleaurable experience. And those of you upgrading from power pc Macs can rest assured the change to Intel is a good think.

Oh by the way: we haven't had any problems with noise, this computer runs very quite. It is warm on the bottom as are most laptops. I have seen the video's on YouTube.com about noisey fans, and the ones I've seen are using graphics intensive applications for prolonged periods of time. When you use the processor is used intensively it needs to be cooled. In both situatons I would recommend one of those laptop coolers/shields. Most people with a laptop already have one, some have fans built in, that run off a USB port, and some are passive and work very well. I use the latterf with great success.
Being accustomed to the Windows operating system I had some worries about adjusting to apple.  I couldn't handle Windows anymore--too many crashes, viruses, and so many other problems...I think it was one of the biggest causes of stress in my life!  Switching to apple was a smart move, let me rephrase that...A BRILLIANT MOVE!  The operating system is amazing and makes Windows look horrible...its so easy to use and everything seems so organized.  The software that comes standard with this macbook is excellent!  iPhoto is awesome!! The camera is pretty sweet.  I have enjoyed the glossy screen so far.  As far as overheating, I haven't had any problems...just pick up a notebook cooler to protect it from any heat slow down effects.  I strongly reccomend you purchase extra memory (go for the 1gb upgrade)-you'll be happy you did!  And for the price I think it smart to upgrade to the 120gigabyte hard drive.  After all, if you're looking at paying extra for the sweet black color you probably have some additional cash to fork over for more memory/hard drive.  Here is my little break down list

PROS

- Compact design

- Awesome Screen

- Great interface

- Great basic software package

- I dig the keyboard

- Fast in most applications

-magnetic adapter

-office runs awesome

CONS

-Running non-universal applications can be a bit slower (e.g., creative suite 2) as the program has to be translated through Rosetta-this will not be such a problem as software will become more universal for intel based macs

-it does run hot, but most laptops (in my opinion) do...get a notebook cooler with this purchase

ONCE YOU GO APPLE YOU'LL NEVER LOOK BACK!
Could not be happier. Good software bundle, renders video surprisingly well,  I like the keyboard and screen. Nice small size. Battery life good. Magsafe power adapter great.  Might buy the 1.83 instead if I had to do over, doubt I would notice that little difference.

Hard drive as easy to replace as the RAM is a nice touch- another reason the get the smaller drive and upgrade it later. The remote control is neat- used it for a slide show in keynote (keynote opens my powerpoint shows and has some slicker effects, so it looks like I'll save a couple of dollars there too). Similarly, pages opens and save MS word documents, so for $49- I have an ofice bundle that meets my needs.
I love it. It is not perfect, but it is close.

The black looks great. It is not shiny, but matte. It is not painted on, but infused in poly-whatever material used to make the case. It is durable and buffs clean from fingerprints when needed.

The magsafe connector is great. I have damaged other laptops from tripping over the power cord, no more with magsafe. I also love the lack of a latch, as magnets hold the laptop closed--a nice touch.

It gets a bit warm, but honestly it doesn't bother me. I prefer that the fans are as quite as they are. It is a trade off, cool computer=loud computer. I prefer a bit warmer and whisper quiet as the MacBook is.

What else can I say? It is super fast, it runs OS X and Windows, it has a beautiful screen, and it feels great in my hand, and works perfectly. I can make DVDs that play on my lousy cheap DVD player hooked to my TV (that my PC can't seem to). I think the huge track pad is great. You can use two fingers to scroll thru documents and use two fingers instead of one to right-click. Yes, a Mac laptop that can right click--finally.

The only complaint is the speakers are small and not very loud for some things. Without headphones, hearing sound when watching DVDs is hard, since DVDs have a wide sound range, so the lower volume sound, like dialog can be difficult to hear whereas the music and explosions are easier. Even if I turn it up full volume, I cannot hear everything. To make this better, I downloaded the free VLC player for DVDs and media, as it allows me to boost the gain with an equalizer, and be able to hear dialog. iTunes also has an equalizer, so boosting the gain is fine in that program. Upshot, speakers small, not perfect, if a problem, use headphones or software that adds an equalizer.

If you want to save money, buy the white one, it is a better deal, and some prefer how it looks. I like the black, so I paid the extra money. Newegg has memory for it, and its cheaper than Apple's by far, and this MacBook is super easy to upgrade memory to 2 gig. I highly recommend more memory if you are a power user.

Overall, I love it.
I would rate this 4.5, but there is no option. I do not feel that it deserves 5.0 either due to a few issues.

Well, overall impression is very good. Great looking as most Apple's  products. 1"thick and has decent small factor for road warrior.

Performance: It is about 2-3 times faster than my old 12.1 G4PB depending on what you run. Everything is very snappy and OS Tiger and iLife'06 work flawlessly. One of the best OS yet. I recommend to reinstall the system. I get around 5GB back by eliminating those programs, etc. that I do not need. Otherwise, it takes around 17GB for complete installation. Quite a lot as it comes straight from factory, me think.

Features: Well, here is what MacBook really shines. It comes with all you would ever need at the best price package. Look at specs yourselves and you will understand what I am saying. I would recommend getting aftermarket memory stick (1GB costs around under $90). Even upgrade to 1.25GB, it is really worth it. Unlike old small iBook, MacBook aftermarket do-it-yourselves upgrade is a breeze whether memory or harddisk.

What is hot: 1. Built-in iSight is pretty good. Better than my expectation. 2. Very nice responsive keyboard and trackpad. You might need to adjust your trackpad response per your personal preference. 3. Keyboard at first look seems unusual, but after a few hours, it think that it does stand out from usual crowd. 4. Nice wireless iDVD remote. 5. Subtle glossy screen, delivers awesome picture quality, while dose not produce too much glare while you are outdoor. 6. Magsafe is one great addition. Very well thought out and design indeed.

What is not: 1. Heat is way beyond my liking. However, it is only at top left of the laptop bottom, where you connect power supply (Magsafe). It is not just warm at that spot, it is blistering hot. This is very imminent when using AC regardless of power setting. While on battery at battery saver mode, it does cool down and only gets warm. I highly suggest that you get cooling pad to max out longevity of your precious lappy. 2. Small lappy factor is not that great. Well it is a tad lighter than MBP by about 0.4lb. 5.2lb is pushing for most true road warriors. Considering many other goodies you will be carrying in your bag. The old small Mac lappies weigh around 4.2-4.6lb only.

Bottomline: If you want the hottest lappy in the market now, go get it. If you think that you can wait, you might want to wait toward the end of the year. I am being hopeful to see MBP in 12 or 13" or Apple improves heat problem for all their new laptops. Well, MBP heat issue is known since the release until today.
Without a doubt the best machine I have ever used. Typing away on it right now and it is simply incredible. The keyboard is brilliant. A hundred times more comfortable, at least for me, than the Macbook Pro keyboard. No two ways about it, this Macbook is a beauty. The display- gorgeous. Buy now, you won't regret it.
I love my new computer. It had everything that was written in the description and works wonderfully.
I'm a mac user for about 2 years now, and my first mac was a very very robust and beautiful power book 12' alu (Power PC processor). Also, my brother got an imac 20' (intel) a few months back, so my review is based on my experience with those two machines.

1- the beginning, the OS change:  I  switched from a HD notebook (very good, I think, in terms of overall performance of the hardware and the robustness) to the PBook  , due to the various overheard things about the mac platform. They were all true, and I'm never coming back. And since my brother got the imac with intel processor, with the abillity to run windows natively, I saw I needed to get an Intel mac.  The search began...

2- The Macbook: I got the latest (as of 01/04/07) and the best of the lineup (a 2.0Ghz Intel core 2 duo proc., 2Gig of Ram, 160Hd.(5600RPM Vs a 200G but 4200Rpm which I think is best))

3- The opinion:  so far I have it for two weeks, and I can say that it's about 2x faster than my 1.5Ghz G4 Powerbook, when encoding video for Ipod and encoding music in Itunes.

The apps take about half of they used to in the Pbook to open, even "under Rosetta"ones, like Photoshop.

The resolution is pretty good for a 13' display, at 1280/800.

It gets hot, very hot, but just as hot as my old pbook.  It doesn't give me any worries.

The vent wines a bit, but just when the proc. is going for it, and I can live with that.

It feels a little bit fragile, but just a little bit.  But I'm comparing it to my 15' HP notebook and my 12' alu powerbook.  And when you balance it with the weight and capabilities of the Macbook it's just a joke.  More than worth it.

The OS, oh the OS...  I'll try not to take "the apple side" of it, but it's just REALLY another issue.  And i LIKE win XP.  Ilife.  Isight.

- finishing: I went to dell.com and made a very similar config (impossible to make it the same).  [...] dell X [...] macbook.

- result: Mac OS (plus Ilife and Isight) + Win with bootcamp (free)= no brainer.  I didn't  gave a 5 star because it's made of plastic, but isn't anything else out there?  (besides the mac book Pro?) ;)
This is a fantastic product.  If you are looking at this model because of the difference in price between it and the core 2 duo version that just came out, spend the money, however.  If you're set on this one - get it refurbished, so it's got the latest firmware version that fixes the fan problem (or just update as soon as you get it)
First time Mac owner/user. After many frustrations with PC and the instability of its operating system, I switched to a Mac. No regrets about that. The bundled iLife software with this product allow a novice Mac user the chance to work with digital music and photo without the frustration of application incompatibility. Its software performance between applications is nearly seamless.
The only negative side that I found is the keyboard. I liked the old powerbookG4 keyboard style better.
just got this as a gift

no hard drive

no restore disks

they sent a copy of mac osx 10.4 for the g5

what kind of service is that?
I  purchased the black Macbook with 1 GB RAM in June. So far, so good! The battery does get hot but not exceedingly. Battery life is not outstanding, but workable. Recharging is easy: I usually recharge my ipod the same time I am recharging my notebook battery.  I have not explored all the programs available as yet. At the moment, I just download my photographs and short movies to the hard drive. Surfing is effortless. It is an enjoyable little machine to own, and it looks good too.
I got my mac in the month of May, soon after apple released this grt machine into the market. Its really nice right from fast 2GHz intel duo processor from finshing - good looking black. I like mac very much,but the problem is majority of technical software were designed to run on windows. Here I got the solution. I use mac for general web browsing and switch over to windows (on the same laptop ) to work on technical software.........really grt........nothing to loose. You can experience the real power of the processor when use advance computing software........... probably get surprised at the first time.

One thing I have to mention is apple customer care. I got the problem with my macbook after a couple of months. The technician at apple store said there is a problem with MLB of my macbook and sent it to reapir. (Since Iam still under warraty its free of charge.) After one week i got it back and when I turned on ............................................... Oh....... again the same problem. (I don't know what the guys did after keeping it for one week.  but the report says they changed the MLB)

I rushed to apple store on  the same day.  WITHOUT ANY THINKING, THERE THE MANGER OFFERED ME  TO GET IT EXCHANGED WITH NEW MACBOOK. And now Iam using that new one that seems alright to me.  And it is great thing that apple  cares for customers than anything else!!!!!!!!!!!

One thing I would like to mention is the battery time. the apple website says upon full charge you  get upto 6 hours. In practice it never happens and can you imagine how much time you get the battery when you are using it for regular netsurfing?...........................................Belive me its  typically around 2 hrs!! If you need to work off the power for long time than macbook may not perform upto your expectations.

Other wise everything is good and is worth for your money.
Based on all the previous reviews, you can tell this is a great laptop.  I just wanted to comment on how good Amazon was on processing the rebate.  I have just about given up on products that offer rebates (i.e. I either miss the UPC Code, the receipt wasn't the original, etc.).  However, Amazon provided constant updates and the check arrived in the time frame given by Amazon.  I am glad I bought this product through Amazon and would trust them again with a product offering a rebate.
I bought this MacBook to replace a 12" PowerBook G4 that died on me a few months ago, and let me just say - I absolutely love it. The black is SLEEK, and the performance is great.

It does get significantly hotter than the G4, but its not anything that I'm too concerned about. I've been using laptops for nearly 15 years now, and I've felt notebook computers a lot hotter than this one.

Finally, I purchased this item from Amazon, and received it a day later - USED AND BROKEN (it even had the previous owner's amazon invoice inside the box)! Now I'm in a fight to get my money back.. save yourself the trouble and buy it directly from Apple.
To be honest I've had little computer time on our new Apple MacBook as my kids have been too busy using our new computer.

What little time I have spent using the Apple MacBook has been fast and sweet. This is one sleek, fast machine with a nice size hard drive.

We added the Paralells software and Windows XP software to run our PC programs ---- and so far no problems. The computer just zips along.

Wonderful machine. No doubt about it.
A good companion with the white or black iPods, I believe that Apple has finally come out with an attractive and attractively priced portable - that means business. Several features will surprise Mac fans:

- Although it's only 13.3 inches, the clairty and brightness of the screen makes for easy viewing. It's easy to watch for long periods of time withoutt straining.

- The black version (which comes at a slightly higher price) is particularly striking, though all the current configurations have that shiny screen many have been requestiong for so long.

- This has a very respectable speed, though maxing out the RAM will really give you the opportunity to enjoy the machine at its best.

- Although this laptop has some real power under the hood, heat build-up surprisingly wasn't an issue, even with long sessions. In fact, a long-standing  problem seems to have been solved - that of cursor skittishness caused by heat. I found tracking very smooth under all conditions.

- One should be careful wtih the hinge on the MacBook; as long as lift the screen from the edges, you'll have no problems at all.

- The black version can accumuulate visible "greasiness" on the pad, if that's an issue for you. I haven't noticed the same for the white version.

Apple has a winner with this one, no question.
I'm a long-time Mac user and an officer in a Macintosh Users Group. If you want high performance at a good price, you cannot go wrong with a MacBook. It's fast, it's powerful, it's wireless - and it'll turn heads. A very, very capable machine. The new glossy screen is a total pleasure - bright and ultra sharp. The new keyboard is a treat to use and the built-in iSight camera is even better than the one Apple sells separately. My only negative - I recommend going out and buying more memory right away. I got 2GB and the machine blazes! I now use my MacBook as my desktop machine as well - it sits closed behind a 20" monitor. When I travel, I simply unplug it and go!

Highly recommended!
Totally awesome. A little slow with only 512 MB of RAM, you simply must upgrade to get real speed, particularly if you are using any Adobe apps or similar software that isn't Universal (written for the new Intel processor) yet. Integrating iSight was a great idea, PhotoBooth is lots of fun with a bunch of friends crowded around! FrontRow and the remote control is awesome, very impressive, although it doesn't seem to control the volume if you are listening to music through an AirPort Express. The rubberized outer shell is a joy to touch, although it does collect fingerprints. The keyboard is awesome, although the spacing feels a little different than my PowerBook's does. Typing is also much quieter. In fact, the fans rarely run, and with its nearly silent hard drive, the machine is almost always totally silent. Very cool (although it can get a bit warm!). The magnetic latch to keep the lid closed is brilliant. The display is phenomenal, I love the glossy surface and the brightness goes very high, much higher than my PowerBook (a 12" 1.33Ghz in case you are wondering).

All in all, a wonderful machine, it's nice to see Apple releasing such a well-rounded and well-designed successor to the iBook at such a reasonable price. Oh, and it will make your friends instantly jealous, which is always fun! ;)
I have been an "Apple" fan for years.  But have not purchased an apple for about 8 to 10.  I felt that Apple was trying to re-invent the wheel.  Finally they decided to drop that idea and improve the wheel.  Now comes "Macbook". The idea of taking technology that is available, that we are all familiar with and making IT better, YES!  The best laptop on the market, along with airport, you have an all in one wireless, portable, system, the literally plugs in, turn off/on, and boom...works!  I purchased the "bootcamp" and was able to run XP, with some work documents.  WOW "windows" on a Mac?  Other computers beware!  If you want a computer that is going to last 5 hours battery time, music, DVD's used, work, JUST WORK, and is ready to go out the box, use the "Macbook" from Apple.  While the others try to catch up you'll see imitators, even the long awaited "VISTA" platform from Microsoft, mimics the Apple operating system...Hmmmm?  But Apple is allready coming out with "Panther"!  Bye Bye - Imitators....come back to the originators!
This notebook booted up very fast and was generally the quickest Mac I have ever owned. But after a marathon 3 hour session in Photoshop one afternoon, got a blister on my left leg. That shocked me. Went to visit the Apple store and the Mac genius said that was normal. Well, not to me. Ended up selling it and bought a Sony FJ notebook and it runs way much cooler. Sorry Mac, you lost me on this one...
For a consumer level laptop, this system rocks!  I just helped a neighbor pick out a Dell laptop for his business.  His is feature for feature the same and the price is nearly the same.  However the Macbook is smaller and has just as many if not more features.  O.k. O.k. - I'm biased - I've been a Mac fan for a LONG time.  But my wife wanted to be as much (well, she'll never be as "much") of a Mac geek as I am, but she also wanted a small form factor.  The other caveot - she needed to be able to do her work at home on it.  With the Intel chip in this puppy, 2GB of RAM in it, and running parallels - she's now able to run XP just as fast, if not faster on this laptop as she is able to at work.  It's a great package all the way around.

IMHO - if Apple were to lower the price they'd have a tough time keeping up with all the orders they'd have.  The price is great for what you get.
I got the black Macbook and it's the first Mac I've ever had. It's amazing, and affordable. The features included with it (iSight camera, magsafe connections etc.) made all my friends jealous because their laptops seemed really boring compared to theirs and the black made it look really nice. (Along with the apple on the back that glows when your using it, looks really nice and attractive) And it goes fast, works great.

But, it has its downfalls. Personally, I experienced problems importing videos from my camcorder onto the computer. The audio got all choppy and was worthless, basically. I went to the Apple Store (they really take care of you at that place, that's another reason why I would recommend a Mac) and they tested it a bunch of times but ultimately this time I was disappointed and they told me to go try to resend the footage to my camera to transfer to the new computer. Otherwise, they said it might be a hardware problem. I haven't tried importing it again so I don't know but it was irritating to not be able to do that.

I would still highly recommend this laptop to any computer savvy person. (Some who don't really understand computers find it hard to comprehend a Mac, which is kind of silly since it's basically like Windows) All computers have flaws (atleast as far as I can tell) and this computer has the features, customer service, and affordability to warrant those little flaws.
I am a recent Windows convert and I know I will never go back.  This black Macbook is everything I could ever want in a computer.  It has so many features built into it you will wonder how you ever lived without them.  It sounds funny but the little things on this computer are the things that make me the happiest.  The "widgets" are out of this World.  You can click an icon and have as many widgets as you want on the screen.  The widgets include currency converter, weather, World clocks, stock ticker, BBC radio, etc, ect, etc.  You can downloads 100s of widgets right onto your computer and save yourself hours searching around webpages for the same info.  There is even a flight tracker that will track any flight on Earth,

COME ON! It's almost too much to handle but it is so nice to know you can do whatever you want with this thing and use all the native software.  Unless you want to do Photoshop or Word... you know.  The built in camera is brilliant and with ichat (can use with AIM) is awesome! You can video conference without wires and all that.  I travel a lot and am gone for months so the built in camera will come in handy.

The Macbook is extremely light yet durable.  The keyboard feels rock solid.

And this thing is quick!! I only have 512MB of Ram in it but I will upgrade to 2Gs when I install Photoshop.  If you don't use a lot of graphics software this machine is perfect stock.  So quick.

Again, the things that impress me the most are the built in things like all the true-to-life screensavers and desktop images.  So cool.

I set the Macbook up to my exact specifications in no time.  And I'm not just talking about my name and that sort of thing.  I changed and customized so many settings and this is the first Mac I have ever used.  Take that Windows.  I used Windows for 15 years and there was still settings I couldn't change.

Don't think about getting this computer, RUN to the store and get it!! You will not be sorry!
I have been scouting Macs since a close friend called me up from Hawaii one evening and told about his recent experience in seeing a demo on GarageBand.

As a music composer and performer, I knew a lot about PC software and have been a Cakewalk customer for numerous years.  But something within my friend's voice persuaded me to go to the nearest Apple store the next day just to see if his hype was real and this friend is pretty level headed and calm all the time.

Upon my visit, I checked out GarageBand and this was my first experience with a Mac in at least 12 to 13 years and even then I was not a regular user of Apple's products.

The first thing about using a Mac as a PC user is that you expect things to be more complicated than Apple has made them.  Everything about a Mac is simplified to the nth degree.  I had bought my wife an iPod Mini which was just as simple as every other product we have been exposed to.

Then after seeing the simplicity of GarageBand, I have put the Mac Mini and then the MacBook Pro in my crosshairs.  Then on my birthday in May, Apple releases the Macbook.  It could get no better than this for the price and the power built within the Macbook.

The Macbook has even matched or exceeded some of the supposedly more powerful computers such as the MacBook Pro or G5 as one online review indicated.

Every application is simple and once you accept the fact everything about being a Mac user is simple.  Faster boot up times, no blue screens of death, no cumbersome viruses, and life just gets easier.

I have had my black MacBook in my hands since June 28, 2006 and it has been truly a red-letter day for me.  I am using products within the iLife suite and more.

When it is possible to install Windows products without installing Windows XP either later this month (July) or August, I will add my favorite PC programs.  Otherwise, I will probably buy Parallels over Boot Camp since I want to be able to run Sonar Home Studio XL beside GarageBand via ReWire.

Music does not get any better or simpler to produce.  I just discovered a device to connect analog video to the USB port on the Macbook as well.

With the built wireless access, you will never realize how much you previously gave up by being tied down with desktop computers.

Thank you Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and Andy Grove!  The 2006 Macbook is truly a winner!
This was my first Mac.  I feared a much steeper slope of getting used to it's applications, and other than some small frustrations (Microsoft Messenger and skype not allowing video calls) this makes a good case for being my best notebook ever.

The Good

- Shiny screen, accomodating the new form factor was quite easy

- the wireless configuration was VERY VERY easy

- connecting a HD video camara to the firewire connector, and using the built-in iMovie software was amazingly easy

- I haven't missed the modem at all.  leaving it out was the right move

- the phonebooth application is really cool

- the "on" indicator for the iSight camera (small led) next to it is very cleverly placed.

- no complains at all about the time it can run on batteries, outperforms my Dell NB (one with brand new battery)

The Great

- the magnetic attachment for the power connection to the notebook, and the subtle on indicator (orange/green) is a great feature

- the keyboard is really comfortable.  Hard for the letters to be removed (great when you have a pet)

- you will hardly find where the microphone is... and you don't need to.  You can use skype with the NB in a speaker-phone-like set-up w/o any issues

- it is really fast on Mac OS.  I'm just waiting for bootcamp to stop being beta to install it

- the structure is really solid (I have to say it after using IBM's T40s for years.. those are amazingly easy to damage and not that solid)

The not-that good

- It gets hot! and I don't mean only warm.  If you want to put it in your lap after it has been running for a couple of hours, it will be uncomfortable enough (almost burning) on your left leg that you won't stand it.

- Even at the max volume it is not loud enough.  Such a shame to miss that simple variable in such a great home notebook

- Slightly heavier than what I expected

- (FrontRow issue in reality).  I just hate how the podcasts I suscribe with get mixed with the songs.  I ended up building a specific "music" playlist to get rid of that issue

- Ejecting the DVD/CDs: in one of every 3 cases, the CD gets stuck and I find myself doing small acrobatic moves to get it out
The MacBook is a high quality machine with only a few flaws. It is fast, compact, lightweight, and well-designed. Have no fear about the keyboard. It's excellent, despite its non-conventional looks. The glossy screen is beautiful; despite using it in a wide range of settings, I have no problems with glare. I only have two complaints: one is that the black finish collects fingerprints rather easily. It's not bad enough that I wish I had selected the white machine instead, but it's something Apple could work on for the next revision. The last is the "mooing" sound that many have commented on. It seems to be a problem only when the laptop is plugged in, but it's still annoying. I've put a complete review up on techrecs.com, but the most important thing is to take a look at the laptop in person for yourself.
This is a really fast fast fast computer.  And it's really reliable.  I almost never shutdown the computer -- I just close the lid and put it to sleep.  It hasn't frozen or hung on me, and I've had it since May.  I love the magsafe connector and all the other little details that Apple thought of in designing the MacBook.  It's way quieter than the Thinkpad I used to have.  The battery life is awesome and totally offsets the weight.  I've used it for over 5 hours multiple times without charging.  Even with a heavy activity and wifi, it lasts at least 4 hours.  Just switch the power management to better battery life and control the display brightness.  Oh, and the wi-fi range is wonderful.  I can see more networks an from much further away than my Thinkpad used to.  My only advice is get more memory.  It really flies when it has more memory.  The built-in software is great too.  I love that Mac OS X is built on UNIX and GarageBand rocks!

I seriously think there are only two really good high quality computer makers out there, IBM and Apple.  And now IBM doesn't make computers anymore, but Apple sure is making them better than ever.
I recently decided to buy my first mac in that being a macbook because I needed both a new computer as well as a laptop and I wanted to get out of the windows world. The os itself is realy awsome however unfortionently the hardware doesnt seem that great because this new system of apple's seems to be plagued by all sorts of problems namely moo or constant noise from the fan motors reving up and down constantly as well as a wine noise coming from the cpu which i hear is artributed to a problem with the logic board. Mine actualy started off with a small barely audible wine and has since turned into a loud sizzling noise that I can hear over my tv. Not good I'm afraid it might go up in flames shortly so I'm plnaing on returning it and wait untill apple solves all these issues. If you need a notebook now I would sugest you eather buy an older ppc module or get a pc such as a thinkpad, etc.
I would advise potential purchasers to wait as long as they can so the bugs in the new MacBook can be ironed out.  I purchased a new MacBook in late July, and was wowed by its super-fast performace and all the great features that come with Tiger.  Glossy screen is also excellent.

However, after about 8 days it refused to shut down, and went into a hibernation.  I had to leave it for 2 days to exhaust the battery, and then put it on AC power and we were away again.  After that, it ran for 3 days, and then crashed like my old PC.  That was one week ago and it shows no sign of working ever again.  Several calls to Apple's support line to puzzled operators have failed to uncover what is going on.  several attempts to restart and reboot the computer have failed, and other than that they haven't been too forthcoming with positive solutions...  Because I didn't ring them within 10 days of purchase I can no longer get a replacement, thus will need to be without a laptop for some weeks whilst it is serviced.  this is not good news...

When you read the discussion forums at Apple.com, it seems the problem is fairly widespread.  So I do advise waiting a little while before buying, though surely they should have picked up a problem like this in testing? A few months wait should see an improved MacBook shipping, or do what I should have done, and spend a bit more to get the MacBook Pro.  Proceed with caution for the next little while!
Apple is the best, must I say more. This computer is great and easy to use, and it now has WINDOWS XP!!!
No "Moo-ing", no overheating, no sharp edges, no peeling paint, no stains and no trouble installing RAM upgrade. MS Office ran a bit slow under Rosetta but a 2GB RAM upgrade made a big difference and I would highly recommend it.

Can't believe all the bad reviews this machine is getting, either I got very lucky or some people just like complaining about successful products (did somebody say iPod?). Best portable I have ever owned by far.
I have been functioning on an iBook G3 for quite sometime now and went for a visit to the Apple store.  These intel MacBooks are really fast compared to any PowerPC books I have used in the past.  The built in iSight is a nice feature and the remote is handy.  If your going to invest in one of these though, I would highly recommend getting the Apple Care protection plan as I have experienced various hardware problems with my iBook.  By that point you might as well fork up the extra money for the black.  The only bad thing about the MacBook is that is gets quite hot.  For those of you with an iBook, be prepared because this one gets even hotter than that. (Too hot to touch)  Overall, a nice computer for the price-considering all of the bundled software that you DON'T have to erase. (unlike Windoze)
The Thinkpad T series is IBM/Lenovo's standard business laptop, and as a college student, I have found it to be perfect. I have the T60 model with the specs listed above: T2500 (2GHz Core Duo), 1 GB Ram, 100 GB Hard Drive, SuperDrive, Bluetooth, Wireless Internet, Fingerprint Reader, Windows XP SP2, 128 MB ATI Radeon x1400. The laptop is very well constructed and sturdy. The keyboard is excellent, and very responsive. The screen is slightly dim, but I usually use it at an even dimmer setting anyways to conserve battery life. I also have a dock and a 21" widescreen monitor. Recently, when my computer became infected, I merely used the backup sector (which takes away 20GB from your hard drive) to reload everything - it was a lot easier than manually reformatting, installing Windows, installing the thinkpad drivers, etc. The drivers are also very good, with the exception of the Thinkpad Access Connections, which I uninstalled immediately. The embedded security chip works well, if you need to use that. I prefer to key in a password rather than use a fingerprint reader. The fingerprint reader will not work if there is moisture of your fingertip. It also needs to be recalibrated (i.e. reprogram your fingerprint) every know and then. Since getting a dock though, I've chosen to forego the fingerprint reader completely.

I purchased this thinkpad with the accidental damage protection warranty, which means I can do nearly anything to the thinkpad I want, and it will be replaced. Why would I though - it's a great computer.

Battery life is pretty good - the 6 cell battery is rated at 3.5 hrs and will give you a decent 2.5. You can always upgrade to a 9 cell battery and/or take out the DVD-burner and stick in an extra battery there.

Opening up the T60 is also easy, and allowable under the warranty to some extent - for example, adding RAM or replacing the keyboard (replacement keyboards are shipped overnight!)

I also like the matte-ish finish off the laptop cover as well as the screen. All in all, a wonderful laptop, and with a student discount, very affordable. The newer Thinkpads have Core 2 Duo processors (marginal performance increase over the Core Duo in this laptop), and are Vista Ready. You can always upgrade. Highly recommended laptop.
I just got this 6440 and new to laptops. It seems like a good unit for the price. I was hoping for other reviews while I have time to return it if need be. Peace on Earth
I had the worst experience with buying a laptop on line. Not only did was it seven years old, there were a lot of minor problems. I called the company an he not only made excuses on why it didn't work but he tryed to sell me the items to fix it.  Loser!
Recieved it right on time,and it looked brand new not a wear spot anywere. I use it mainly for my magicjack phone. It would also be good for small kids to learn on. The hard drive is to small to add anything, but for my purpose its great.
If anyone out there is considering purchasing a product from midwest notebooks , consider this. They are dealing with products that other people are getting rid of. I bought a dell notebook from them and within a couple of weeks I had to send it back because it kept crashing. They failed to return the disc and pamphlet that originally came with it. I told them about it and they totally ignored me. If they were local Iwould have no trouble finding a place to store it. Think twice about buying from them . I know I never will and i'm telling everyone else about them.
I rate my item 0 a big 0 I have never used it, it was shipped to me very dirty and it was not like how it was looking on the add, it was sent to me with a broken battery, the screen was really really dirty that there was candy sticking on the screen and it was sticky. I have wrote to the guy that sold it to me and he didn't have the nerve to write me back. I hope that the amazon corporate office see this scam and take consideration.
I am NOT HAPPY!!!
I don't have one but I see two things wrong with the price on it already, one is the hard drive and two the ram is low, I could deal with the hard drive or the ram being to low but not both for the price.
A reasonable compact laptop, with a limited memory and storage, just right for a schoolkid like my nephew to take his work to and from school. nice and light weight. It does the job efficienly, no frills.
I bought this computer to use im my home and It is really fantastic. The dual core processor does it`s work very well and the 1 GB RAM is more than enought to do all jobs I want.
Amazon, you NEED to say if this is the GLOSSY screen or not.
I have already had to replace my battery (wouldn't sustain charge), power cord (burned out and no longer worked), and now the part where my headphones goes in has become loose and is pretty much unusable. All within four months of owning the thing. I like the computer...but man...it sure is made pretty crappy.
I've been a computer programmer/user for 27 years, and this is absolutely the finest computer I've ever used.  Quality and attention to detail are paramount.  And, the ability to run Windows at near-native speed using Parallels Desktop makes it almost perfect.  With one click of the mouse, you go from a very fast Mac notebook to a very fast Windows notebook, and everything works as one expects from Apple.  And, don't worry about the one review I read here about it getting too hot.  Don't know what the problem was in that case, but it runs at about the same temperature as the G4 Powerbook it replaced--no problem at all.  With this computer and the MacBook there is no reason for most people to even look at other brands; price is competitive, but the Macs are far better made and with Parallels installed run practiically all the software in the world.  The only computer you'll ever need!
This laptop runs HOT !!! I have used Dell, IBM, and Sony laptops and none of them compare to the heat levels of the MacBook Pro. While the charger is connected, it is impossible to work with this computer, your palms would be burned.
I bought mine a week ago (August 1st, 2006) and they told me that all the major issues with this laptop had been fixed, I guess the heat issue has not been solved just yet.
It is certainly dissapointing that I went to the Apple Store to ask a "genius" about it and he told me the heat was within spec ! What does he mean by that ? Did I buy a computer or a Barbeque Grill ? Other than that, the laptop is pretty good looking, the OS is very stable, and the software included is enough for every day needs, but how good is that if you can not use it beacause you may burn the palm of your hands and wrists ? Oh, and I also bought the I-Lap...at least that works so you don't toast your nuts !
I finally made the switch to Mac and look what happens... I guess PCs and Microsoft were not that evil and bad after all. Do not believe the hype.

I am the proud owner of a new MacBook Pro and have been using it heavily for the last couple of months.  I have owned Macs previously and also regularly use Windows PCs since there is some software that I like that only runs on the Windows machines.  With this new machine, I can quit juggling between the two boxes.  I can now use the wonderful Mac OSX most of the time, but boot up in Windows on the Macbook Pro when I have to run a Windows only program.  Wonderful.
