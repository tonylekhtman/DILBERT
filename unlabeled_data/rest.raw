I saw a huge drive-thru line and was scared that the line inside would be also long. Fortunately, it wasn't. Food and service were perfect as always.The Grilled Chicken Caesar Salad and the Raspberry Avocado Salad are two of my favorite things to get here. The Raspberry Avocado is a good choice if you're looking for a lighter lunch, but passing up on their grilled chicken is hard for me to do. They have easily the best grilled chicken I've ever had from a place that uses a customizable restaurant format (similar to Chipotle's ordering format). 

If you go to the downtown location though, I recommend ordering online from about 11:30-1:30 because it gets slammed with ASU students and workers on lunch break.I happened upon Aloha Kitchen on my last visit to Phoenix. The food was authentic and perfect. I grew up in Hawaii and was transported back to the islands and my childhood. On my fortieth birthday, it was the perfect evening. 

The saimin, char sui bao, and the teriyaki chicken were great. I wouldn't recommend the haupia pie as authentic which is a good thing for the locals. When done exceptionally well, it is addictive. 

I will eat here during each and every visit to the area.A large group of us came here for dinner on a Friday night.   We ordered a couple of appetizers: fried green tomatoes was nothing special.  Poutine with smoked meat was good though the portion was slightly on the small side.  For dinner we ordered the Elvis Platter ($130).  It's an impressive display of all the meats along with a few sides.  The beef brisket, chicken, and pulled pork were all very good.  Ribs were on the dry side.  Sausage was good and spicy.  One complaint is the size of the sides - the platter is meant for 6-8 people but the side was quite small- one small bowl of coleslaw, rice, and baked beans.  Both coleslaws and baked beans were very good but since we are sharing, each person only had a tiny portion.  If the sides were larger or if they were replenished upon request that would've made the meal even better.We loved this place. The staff here was so nice and attentive, our waitress was the sweetest and always smiling. Their salsa trio they bring was so good, and all of their food from the tamales to the fajitas were delicious. It's definitely better than your average run of the mill Mexican restaurant. We will definitely go back.I like this place for a once in awhile go to for homemade matzah ball soup! You can get it without noodles and just enjoy the goodness of soup. Probably best in town. They try to give you that deli feel we get back home but they don't put pickles on the table anymore and it's gotten further away from a NY deli thru the years. The sandwiches however are nice and thick loaded with fresh meats. The bakery section is quite small compared to others and the challah is better other places. But the food is good and enjoyable, if you get deli food, not a burger.... (Like someone at our table did....)
The customer service has been variable the times we have been there and the cleanliness has varied too. Not sure if because of how long they have been there or what but hasn't been remodeled. Depending on when you go, you can be waiting awhile too as the place is quite small. I like this place and the local business but overall it's changed a lot thru the years!Went to your north Olmsted location very impressed with the staff and food !!!! My new favorite place :))))Great place! On the izakaya menu the grilled whole squid, taiwanese sausage, baby octopus are awesome. If feeling adventurous try the Jellyfish salad( really good)  or the Nato (acquired taste).   Love the grilled mackerel fillet on standard menu. Sushi is great, my fave is the Keita Roll. Great service, staff is friendly and just overall consistently good food.Anything with the rosata sauce.  Literally,  ANYTHING with that sauce.  The worst decision I have to make is veal or chicken! "Hey, bring me some more of that focaccia bread with my oil and balsamic would ya? I can't get enough!"First I will say this. I LOVE finding a small hole in the wall restaurant with amazingly deliciously fresh food. It doesn't matter where it is, what it looks like, if the service and food are top knotch, I'll go. I first tried hummus xpress when my gf brought home take out. It had been sitting for awhile and I was hungry but man was it good! It left such an impression I couldn't wait to visit in person. Since that day, I've been back only twice mainly because I don't live or work near the area but if I did, oh boy I'd need gift cards because I'd be there regularly. Everything I tried is insanely flavorful, so fresh, so good, the combinations are absolutely endless! It'll never get boring. Definitely recommend this place. Get a wrap, or a bowl, just go already. You won't be disappointed.Instant ramen noodles would have tasted better than this. The ginger flavoring was way too overpowering.I've been out to the bonefish in Michigan and was very excited to see this place was opening.  I've been to this location 3 times, all with pretty awful service, and this last Friday 3\/20\/2015 really took the cake.  Looking at Yelp reviews every seems to love the food, but complains about service.  I Bartend in this Industry and I'm very open to busy staff, new staff, and other issues that come up on a day to day as to why there could be weak service.  My Girlfriend and I sat at the bar for 15 minutes without being greeted once, and there was one lady at the bar.   The bar holds like 15-20 seats so with one person at the bar you see just how much open space there is and how it is impossible to miss us.  We realized that we weren't going to helped after the bartender glanced at us then Went back to stocking 5 bottles of beer( when I stock 5 bottles of beer it usually takes, I don't know 8 seconds?) which took 10 minutes or so.   The 7 other servers\/ staff were all at the other end of the bar laughing it up having a good time, as it looked like they made it through a successful night and were all done at 9, even though they're open till 11.   At least 5 staff members saw us sitting there including the MOD, an older lady who was wearing Blue, and no one said a word to us.   Even with my last two experiences here I was still recommending people come here because the food is great and maybe it was new growing pains for the staff.  Never again.  ide say the food was great but didn't get a chance to try it yesterday.  My first yelp review ever, congratulations for being the one and only on my list .It probably is the best brunch buffet. Very clean and with good desserts. They even had mini red velvet cupcakes and several flavors of gelato. Overall the focus seemed to be more on quantity than quality, there was a bunch of unnecessary stuff that didn't look very good, like pizza. The shrimp and leek dumplings were good! 

The brunch buffet is $30\/pp, versus regular breakfast buffet $20\/pp.We are happy that they are in the neighborhood! Food is great, good wine list for Trilogy wine lovers too! 
Support this business!!!Really! They refused to put my nachos on the side! I don't want it to be soggy when I'm on the plane. The old lady was snappy, and they got a messy kitchen. This is inside terminal E.When I think of Hot n Juicy, my first thought is not crawfish. Probably more along the lines of Megan Fox, Denise Richards, or Megan Good. Crawfish has always been a tough food for me to try. It looks like a ghetto version of a lobster crossed with shrimp and for the longest time I have given it the nickname of "Little Cockroach". I always felt why would you eat a crawfish on purpose? It's like choosing ground beef when you can have steak. Shrimp has always been my favorite weapon of choose for any of these cajun "Boiling Crab" type places, because of the efficient flavor to value ratio. A Crawfish is usually about 9 to 10 bucks a pound and is about 60% shell and 40% meat (I will later find out 90% shell or greater and less than 10% meat). Trust me for a pound of crawfish. You will pay a handsome penny and will not have enough meat to make a crab salad or even an appetizer with crackers. 

How did you find out about Hot N Juicy Crawfish? How does it taste though?? How's the quality? Stop being negative! You might say.

I am guilty of watching Man Vs Food like the majority of all the yelp reviews for this restaurant. Normally, MVF's track record has been fairly poor, but this is different! Who doesn't like Asian flavors crossed with Cajun style? That's like saying you don't like Amerie (so hot!) or Hines Ward (not as hot). I ordered 1 lb Shrimp and 1lb of Crawfish to give Crawfish a try and have my shrimp as a back up, both Hot n Juicy style. 

The shrimp was great of course, although it was slightly under cooked. I think that's because maybe no one ever orders shrimp. It was a nice big size almost Jumbo shrimp sized and it tasted pretty good with the Hot N Juicy sauce, but nothing to jump out of your seat over. Shrimp is a dollar more than crawfish, but its worth it, because it is 95% meat and 5% shell. Time for my first taste of crawfish! At first, I honestly did not know how to eat it. I tried using my shrimp peeling skills, but I looked like a squirrel trying to get a nut. I finally swallowed my pride and asked one of the pretty waitress to help show me how to suck head. Get your mind out the gutter!!! Ha ha.. but that's how you are suppose to eat crawfish. You first suck the head, that's what she said (that's what she said) then you eat the meat. Hmmm.. Good thing this review is PG. The flavor of the juicy coming from the crawfish was a lot better than the shrimp! The taste is very delicious. It's like sipping a hot bowl of pho and some zesty tomato based Italian dish. Maybe that's a bad analogy. Let's say the restaurant smelled and tasted like a cross between a Vietnamese\/Chinese restaurant and a Cajun grill. 

If you look around the restaurant you will see nothing, but people with smiles on their faces. This is unusually, because most restaurants I go to most people look impatient or serious. This is definitely a plus! My rating might be a tad bit harsh, but I feel it is truly honest. I do recommend that you give Hot N Juicy a try, only if you get there early and don't mind driving in to "Chinatown" (didn't see many Chinese places mostly Vietnamese restaurants, but all Asians look a like right? Don't answer that). If you are from Orange County and are spoiled by the Boiling Crab and other restaurants like it, be warned you may not like this place. There is less spicy and a little less flavor. If you are a Asian Cajun newbie, this will be a great start for you. I will go back again with my friends that have watched Man Vs Food, but I'm not a fan of great head with no meat, no pun intended.extremely unhygenic toilets both mens and women's. just wondering how the kitchen would be !
service is  very slow.Wow!!!! If you judge this place by the bad reviews your missing out!!! They accommodate every type of diet need!!! Vegan no problem!!! They where happy to make my order all veggie! The moment I walked in the door they where happy to see me! They know their regulars by name and order!!! This place is a hidden hem in a world of bad customer service!!!!Food:
Bun rieu was probably one of my favorite, ever and I am quite picky with my bun rieu. Their broth isn't drench with too much oil and they aren't stingy with their amount of meats in the soup (crab, shrimp), you can also just go rest. I also got the tofu spring which was also one of my favorite. 

Service: the service wasn't the greatest, waited about 30 mins for our table. 

If I am in the LV area will def. stop by again. DeliciousIncredible pizza, incredible service and ambiance. Everything there is good, even the anchovy pizza  I'm hoping to go back another time for dessert :)The last review I wrote about this place was 4 years ago.  After my visit last night with friends, I felt compelled to write another one because after 4 years it is STILL the BEST place to get sushi in Las Vegas. I've been in California for almost 3 years and simply refuse to eat any sushi out there for fear that it won't taste like Sushi Koma. That's why whenever I come "home" to Vegas,  Sushi Koma is ALWAYS on my to-do list. My friends and I had dinner there last night and once again,  Sushi Koma did not disappoint!!! If you're deciding where to go and you're reading this review,  look no further...I guarantee you will thank me!!!Andrea is an amazing employee. She has outstanding customer service. She is unaware but it's my birthday and she definitely made it special. Thank you Andrea!Last night, my bf and I finally got to make it to one of the Chow Down events.  We wanted to make our rounds and try some new eats. Their black bean burger is craveworthy. Nice soft bun, yogurt based sauce? and a pico de gallo\/ salsa which added a nice earthy freshness. I am at my desk now wishing I could get a bite. We will definitely continue to support these guys.Amazing. Clever Koi never ceases to amaze me. Sit at the bar and ask the bartenders what to order - you can't go wrong with the chow mein, last time I added shrimp and it was enough food for three meals. Don't miss the pork belly steamed bun, get one to start your meal and for dessert! LOVE the crispy pineapple duck. 
Oh and the cocktails...this place rocks. One of the best restaurants in AZ.I know a lot of people like this place! To me it was just okay. I honestly didn't feel it was worth the price. The drinks were extremely expensive & no options to make it a meal we had to buy everything individually. Not to mention a shirtless tweaker was waving his finger in a no gesture at the restaurant window.Micah is awesome, I drive from Gilbert all the way to her location because I know the service is the best in town.This was my first time here and I am impressed by the food quality and customer service. Besides the five stars I am giving to this place, I am giving Ana, our service, all the awards that a server can take. Great job AnaI have been at Zet's a few time and have enjoyed their souvlaki immensely. 

Unfortunately in this particular visit, I ordered the Pork souvlaki and the Pork was dry. Portions are still huge if you are looking for a positive. 

Hoping for better things next visit and remember, don't forget to bring cash.The manager at Ruth's Chris Michael is great and will go out of his way to ensure you have a wonderful evening. They uphold the name and make sure costumes are happy and come back!!First time eating Cambodian food. I am not sure what it's supposed to taste like so it's hard to say if this is what cambodian food is....

Small, quiet place. Entrance was non-initutive to us for some reason, we walked in the kitchen. It's the door on the left if anyone was curious. 

On a Monday at lunch, we were the only people in there around noon. 

I didn't know what to order but I like shrimp so I went for it. I went  for the Shrimp Ling rice combo. It comes with soup, rice and a pickled salad. 

The dish comes on a nice square plate so it makes the food 50x fancier just because it's on a square plate. Lots of shrimp in my plate ~ about 10ish and they're large. The shrimp was grilled and it tasted good but I wouldn't call it amazingly good that I was in love. I ate it and I like it but I thought to myself 'What is Cambodian food because the flavors don't seem unique? It seems like they grilled it in some soy sauce, maybe sugar, added more salt and maybe one or two other spices." FYI - There's bunch of green onions in the shrimp, I think they add that more flavor. They aren't chopped into small pieces, it's like the whole stem but I ate everything. I always eat everything - I don't waste my food (it's almost like a sin not to finish your food unless you take it home... so nevermind).

The pickled salad was refreshing. I like the soup, it was lukewarm and it reminded me of a Chinese wintermelon homecooked soup. It's like a mixed of Chinese style chicken broth with Vietnamese beef broth without the saltiness and msg. Adding the green onions to the soup definitely makes it 50x better as well - WOOHOO. 

My dish was $8 - pretty good price. Thumbs up to that!

Overall, would I go back? Eh - I don't know. I need to try other Cambodian places or maybe I should just have googled about it...maybe Vietnamese food is better? Apparently, the countries are located near each other so it's similar to Vietnamese food.Favorite Thai food in Charlotte! Definitely 5 stars. I drive here from like 20 minutes away and it's always worth it.Never had a bad experience with Falbo Brothers. I've ordered a million times both on Park St and now that I am on the north side. Placed an order with a somewhat cryptic note on it. They actually called to clarify. Thanks guys! Lots of places wouldn't have done that.Fresh food that is very reasonably priced. Great when you just don't feel like cookin' but wanna bring food home. We ordered the meat chili and mini butter tart to go. Chili came with a fresh slice of bread and was full of carrots and other root veggies + ground beef and red kidney beans. Usually I like more meat in my chili but really appreciated all the veg in this one. The woman working the counter was very friendly and my brief encounter with the owner was also great!Ahhhhhmazing pies! I stayed at the Hyatt airport hotel and was delighted to have food delivered tonight very quickly by courteous staff.Unknowingly ended up at this place for the 2nd time in a week due to reviews via Yelp search. Food first time around took me by surprise. The guacamole is a must have here, amazing first and 2nd time around ! First time around..we didn't make it in time for happy hour but this time I made sure to get a 66' Cadillac margarita which uses custom house tequila and features a Grand Marnier floater  4 stars because the waitress was persistent on trying to get us to buy drinks. I understand she was doing her job but if I wanted, I would ask. Really nice outdoor seating area and phenomenal food. Best butternut squash soup I've ever had! Would say it's something like a spicy lobster bisque substituted with butternut squash for the the tomato base and crab for the lobster. 

Would definitely recommend to a friend!They refused to seat us 10 minutes before their official opening time. Gosh it was cold on the stoop. I don't mind that a place is popular and gets full of people, but with tile floors and no sound dampening, I felt like I was having a psychotic episode with competing voices bombarding my brain. I couldn't hear the person I was with sitting across from me. The food.... nicer than some.. but mediocre flavors. The "fresh" flowers were not so fresh. The basil chicken had copious amounts of water at the bottom of the plate totally diluting the sauce and adding a tinny flavor to the dish. Won't go back. The server was very autonomous versus obsequious. I prefer obsequious but I could cut him a break for having too many tables.Brunch was excellent.  Service was attentive.  Make your own Bloody Mary and mimosa bar is a must!  Brunch was served with a choice of warm muffin and fresh fruit before entree was brought out.  Had the apple muffin, warm and moist, carrots, walnuts, raisins and coconut in the muffin was yummy.  Entree was pablano pepper stuffed with jalapeño bacon and scrambled eggs.  Everything was absolutely delicious.Honestly probably the best tasting pho I've had in Toronto and I've been eating pho religiously all my life allllll over town. They're in a run down plaza operated by a family I would guess, based on how there's a couple really young teens working there. 

The broth is amazing and portion is huge! Price is cheaper than average and definitely worth a try if you're in the neighbourhood.A great place for authentic bbq.

Living in little italy, we don't get out here all that often. However, when we crave real bbq, this is where we head. It's all extremely affordable, filling, and super tasty.

My favorite is the pulled pork and pulled chicken. Super tasty and very tender. A great way to try the bbq is one of their sampler platters. There is so much food you will definitely be taking some home, but bbq heats up well, so this is a definite bonus in my book!

The only weak spot in my opinion is the bbq sauce. It's good, but it's not quite 5 stars worth. It needs some more bottom to give it a more full richness, but I'm also an extremely picky person when it comes to bbq. My husband likes it just fine :)

overall, great place, friendly owners, worth the trek.This is one of my favorite places in Lakewood!  i love the beer selection and the food is wonderful!  I love the wings especially and usually get the beer caps.  The patio in the summer provides some of the best outdoor drinking around! When i have friends in from out of town, their sunday brunch is my favorite place to show off what fun it is to live around here.Pizza not only taste bad have the cheese is on the side they obviously turn the pizza sideways their well done french fries turned out raw would not recommendThis was so awesome!!!!!

Really great. Best service and on nice day they prepare your order in a basket with condiments and all so you can enjoy your meal in the park.

You have to try it!!!!We go here on occasion. 

Their portions are very big and they bring little bread loaves out before the meal with your salad.

I have heard the run specials like BOGO burgers, etc. Once we were there they had two for one wraps :)

Beef medallions hubby got were pretty good! He has also ordered Cesar salad wrap which was also good.

I used to get the macadamia crusted Alaskan halibut and it was good with fresh veggies and a side salad. I have tried the salmon, but it was just ok.

Yes their cheesecake is awesome it's made by the same people that make Cheesecake Factory's???? That's what a waitress told us once :) 
  
They always make us fresh coffee for our dessert. 

If your not into red meat well...it's their specialty thus Meat Company :) order a steak when your here.

The other food is kinda...old school 90's\/country club\/diner? I don't know how to explain it.

The house Merlot is good. The food is always fresh and cooked perfect.

They always have coupons on their website and dinner specials.

We have never had a bad experience here and the staff is always super nice. I really like the (tiny, Shakira looking) blonde. She is super nice. Sorry I am very bad with names :)This place used to rock my socks, then bam! The food went south and lost a good bit of flavor. Some good stuff here when they were good, Pad Thai and Spicy Basil pork. Maybe they changed recipes or maybe even cooks, but go back to how you used to be Thai Room! I miss you!Okay, I decided to give this place another try. I made a reservation for the five of us at 8pm on a Friday night. Once checked in, we had to wait for the teppanyaki table to be clear. We decided to go into the bar area and order a few beverages. The bartender came to greet us promptly and offered suggestions from the menu. We ordered items from sake to wine and waters. After about 15minutes we were called over by a very rude hostess who was to seat is and the other party. 

Once we were seated, our sever came to greet us immediately. She was friendly and warm in her greeting and offered anyone who did not have a beverage something to drink. We also all decided to order two orders of the edamame appetizer to share. After about 5-10 minutes of looking over the menu and receiving the rest of the drinks, she came back to take our order. We ordered everything from kids items (my children), to spicy chicken, tuna steak and shrimp & scallops.

Now each of the adult entrees came with soups and salads. These both were served before the edamame. Strange... I come from a world of chefs where the appetizer should be served BEFORE the next courses. Not after. Finally, the edamame came out and it was so very interesting (and not in a good way) how one of the orders was perfectly steamed and hot, yet the other was stone cold. At this point, I was not too upset as my children and guests were happy to consume the vegetable. It was also seemingly convenient how quickly those first few items came out. 

Now comes the worst. From the time we received and finished the soups, salads and appetizers (again in that order) to the time we finally saw our table side chef was approximately 45 minutes! I am sure you are thinking that this is surely an exaggeration. I am sorry to report that it is not as I wear a watch. We sat with no food or attentions for nearly an hour! I have never in my life had this happen before. It seemed as though the world stopped at our table. We all, including the other people sitting at our table, noticed that other tables were being served and attended to. Even one that was seated AND ordered after us!

When our 'cook' finally arrived, he seemed frazzled from the beginning. The first thing he did was drop food on the floor and had to excuse himself with an apology to run to the kitchen to get more. Not a good way to take care of extremely hungry guests... W\/children. As he began to cook, I noticed that he was leaving certain things on the hotter spots of the flat top than he should have. This was causing bits to get burnt and we all could smell it. While he attempted to entertain us, he did the opposite. His voice was quiet and extremely unenthusiastic. I felt as if he did not even want to be there. This caused the intended fun evening for my children to be very dull and almost depressing.

Another thing I noticed was that he was cooking things one item at a time... For the entire table. By this I mean after he did the onion 'volcano' and the fried rice, he cooked all the vegetables, served them, then cleaned the grill. Then cooked the chicken, served it accordingly, then cleaned the grill. Then cooked the red meat, served it, then cleaned the grill. And finally the seafood, served it to the appropriate people then cleaned the grill. After a good 20 minutes of cooking, (and this again is after the 45 we waited to see our cook and uncooked food) we finally got to eat our food. However, as you can imagine, the foods served first were cold while the ones served last were hot. For instance, in my case specifically, I had hot scallops and shrimp paired with cold vegetables and fried rice. Oh, almost forgot, he did not even serve one of my child's side dishes. The children's meals are supposed to come with corn and only one received it. I had to divide up the one portion for both my children while the other party's kids each got their own portion. The food distribution was quite uneven.

Overall, the experience caused my kids to be out at this restaurant from our reservation time of 8 all the way past 11pm! I typically do not indulge in 3 hour dinners unless I am with adults only and it is in a fine dining setting which this was far from. Not my ideal situation in the least. The food that I experience at the proper temperature was decent yet there was very little of that. Even with all this happening we did not once see a manager at all to apologize or attempt to explain why we had to wait so long. The only good thing was that our waitress seemed happy and attempted to do her best in taking care of us which is why we still tipped accordingly. I will say that due to this experience, I will express in detail my dislike and disappointment of this establishment to all my fellow chefs, foodies, restauranteurs and friends and family. This casual and supposedly fun and eventful place turned out to be a frustrating and boring time. This is NOT a place I am likely to ever mention in any light again ever again.I love this location of Einstein's!! The manager Mishelle is awesome and always remembers my name. The bagels are fresh and good. The coffee is a bit pricey for what it is but there is a Starbucks next door. They don't have wifi but like I said there is a Starbucks next door. The parking is ample because of the Safeway parking lot and I've never had to wait long at this location. Great for breakfast on the weekend.

My favorite is  the turkey sausage sandwich on asiago.This is one of my favorite places in toronto. I worked near by, sent and still send all the tourists and beer lovers there. The service is friendly, food is great, there's a great tap selection, and prices are fair. It has a great atmosphere-is especially cozy in the winter, live music anlevel headed security. If you haven't been, deff keep'er in mind!I can't rave enough about this life changing experience. Not only is the breakfast buffet a mile long but you can also get MTO table waffles, AND GET THIS: ALSO a made to order menu item, and they're all good. Price is very fair too. Would recommend.

Also- the bartender with bluish hair who is allergic to bananas was SOOOO great. Loved her. Such good service and so friendly.I hate paying for food that isn't good. Nice vibe but that's what you're paying for! Food is just ok.Love their ice cream and cookies! I always get either the oatmeal or coconut macaroon. There is almost always a line out to the parking lot but it moves quickly. Worth the wait.I'm not a burger gal, but I had this place bookmarked so I figured I should finally try it. Parking was decent for being close to ASU and the restaurant itself has a good amount of seating. Cool setup, unfortunate music selection (80s) and sticky bathroom floor, some initial observations.

They had two tablets set up for ordering on your own but we wanted to cash in on the 10% off deal from checking in so we went to the counter. My brother got the regular size Cajun fries Beyond burger which I wanted to try so I'm glad he chose it, green style sans buns costs $.50 more which seems strange. I ordered my first choice, the Vegefi burger made of quinoa and added jalapeños, diced onions and pickles. We got out buzzers and condiments and waited in our booth. Our food didn't take long and we sat down to begin. I liked my burger, patty was cooked well and there was plenty of lettuce. It was smaller than I expected for the price but did a good job of filling me up. The fries were seasoned well enough. I had to get a few bites of the plant-based meat burger and it was surprisingly good, wasn't sure I'd like the taste of fake beef but it was subdued a bit. 

Simple menu, options for all, and I did appreciate the napkins at the table but didn't realize they were there until I grabbed some by the condiments.Probably the worst KFC ever. Every time I pick up a fries it's cold, not even tad warm. When I tell them to make fresh one they act like they have seen a ghost or something. Today I ordered Zinger sandwich and it looked like they pre heated the same meat again it tasted horrible. I asked her to redo both fries and sandwich.  Sandwich was fresh but chicken was still raw and fries was still cold when I got home. I live about 3 min drive from there.  Anyways never going back again.  This place needs to shut down.Hidden in the Crile building, this is another venue that is easily overlooked from the map.  It's standard Au Bon Pain, which is pretty good, really.  They've added some asian fusion here, which is ... okay.  It is par for the course, for this class of food.  :)Andre the mgr and his staff at Buck & Rider hands down are the complete package .. From beginning to end our visit to this fine establishment was flawless .. We came in to celebrate my Mothers B'day , let's just say, she can be hard to please but Andre made it easy ..  Andre made it special from the moment we walked in.. His staff accommodated all of our special menu request .. PEI mussels were perfection .. My father's pasta was so good he wouldn't even share,  he loved it so much ..  My scallops  were cooked to perfection, kudos to the kitchen staff .. We will for sure be back .. Very gratefulThis.... was honestly the worst four-dollar-signs dining experience of my life. There are plenty of fancy dining places in Vegas where you truly get what you pay for, and this place is not one of them.

In addition to getting food poisoning at 5 am, the server we had was incredibly rude and impatient. It seemed like every question we had about the menu annoyed him. Benefit of the doubt, maybe he was just having a bad day, maybe he had already put in his two weeks and didn't give a crap anymore, but regardless it reflects poorly on the restaurant. 

My mother's first language isn't English, but her English isn't bad by any means. The menu said "salmon skin" and she asked the waiter "what do you mean salmon skin?" and the waiter was like "SKIN. LIKE THE SKIN ON YOUR ARM." and she was like "skin?" and he was like "SKIIIIIN!!! IT'S SKIN!!! *rubs furiously on his arm*". Obviously she knows what skin is but all she was asking was if it was JUST the skin (because you know how fancy restaurants like to be creative and use unique ingredients), to which he finally explained that it was both the salmon + skin. I was appalled by 1) how he was speaking to my mother, 2) the lack of patience and understanding from the get-go since the whole situation literally lasted less than 10 seconds (sorrrrryyyy the hostess seated us in your waiting area and we took up soooo much of your time). Given that the menu itself labels the dish only as "salmon skin," even I - as a native English speaker - would have made the same mistake of assuming it's just the skin.

For the food, we got the chicken, arugula salad, salmon skin AKA salmon + skin lol, and the garganelli pasta. The pasta was undercooked but everything else tasted like you'd expect, nothing mind-blowing. In the end, one of those things gave me food poisoning and I SWEAR to god if it was the salmon skin...... :-)I just came in for an OJ and one of their fruit cups, I was in a deep craving of fruits and this was the closest spot to me that Thursday that offered such small craving to-go. The service was okay\/good. Could have been better.This is quickly becoming one of our favorite breakfast spots. I've been stuck in a rut our last few visits. I get the special which has two eggs, your choice of breakfast meat, grits or hash browns or fruit, and pancakes. 

The grits are some of the best I've had outside of my own kitchen. And the pancakes. Oh, they are fluffy and delicious and the perfect treat at the end of my meal for this pregnant lady.Best breakfast hands down in Akron area. Great options, both savory and sweet. Baked goods are delicious.This place used to be one of my top choices for a quick great sandwich, but has since went south slowly. Their customer service and management is well below par and their quality of sandwich has suffered as well. It is sad, because I use to come here once a week, but I will now go elsewhere. Would not recommend this place, save your money and go to a better run jersey mikes or go across the street to subway and save a few dollars.Top 5 favorite breakfast places in Vegas for Me. In my opinion, they have the best, simple home made buttermilk pancakes. The atmosphere is kind of dainty and old, but the food both breakfast and lunch definitely makes up for it.Definitely good food.  However, I wouldn't get the Santa-Fe burger next time as the fried chillies were really big, not what I expected, and dominated the burger.  I ended up taking them off.

Everyone in party had good things to say about the food.

10% off for checking in on Yelp, just can't beat it!Wow, where to begin. I've been to Redbeards plenty of times, and although the waitresses were never the best, my last trip was putrid. My friend was personally insulted by a waitress after he took 30 seconds to pull out his I.D. She claimed he had an "attitude". I've come across this erratic behavior from staff at Redbeards before, I usually could deal with because of the convience of redbeards being a quick walk from my home. BUT ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. I will never patronize this establishment again. Also, the owner is a total snob. Doesn't seem to like having anyone their who likes to have a good time. This is a young area, embrace it and you would probably do better with that nice hunk of real estate. AMF.Inspired food for a steal... don't be scared, just walk right in and order the carne asada tacos!SO GOOD. Everything was so fresh and had an incredible amount of flavor. I got a large bowl, half white rice and half salad with spicy tuna, regular tuna and salmon and literally ALL the toppings. This place is really close to my work and I came right at lunchtime so the line was pretty long but went by really quick. I'm already craving this place again, I can't wait to go back!The food was decent but the service was terrible. There was only one lady working 10 tables and answering phones for pickup orders. She was very friendly though but still, it was super slow. Probably won't be back.So I'm staying at the hotel and I order outback due to complete desperation. I don't understand how my food could show up cold when I'm literally 100 feet away. The steak tacos consists of 3 to 4 pieces of steak that are so over cooked you can barely eat them.  My sweet potato was cold and unable to melt the butter. And I found some weird plastic thing in my mac & cheese. Overall a poor experience I should've just ordered pizza.OMG! Postino's went above and beyond for me on my birthday and I cannot even begin to thank them enough. 

See they do not take reservations on Sunday's because it gets crazy busy with their brunch and it is just a very popular day. Plus rain was in the forecast for Sunday which was going to make space even tighter. However I called up Postino's on Saturday and spoke with Troy # 1 and told him that I was coming on Sunday with about 20+ people and asked if there was anyway he could help me out. Hmm he says, let me get your number and I will call you back when I can figure out something. So about an hour later he calls to let me know that he can't reserve a table for 20 but that he can can hold at 4 top for me and as my party comes, we can seat them as needed and as long as their is not a wait. Deal!!!! 

So Sunday arrives, I go to Postino's and Troy # 2 lets me know that Troy#1 told him about me and my situation and that he was there to take care of me. :) YAY! so we were seated at our 4 top, and soon after, we were able to take over another table, then another, until we took over the entire back booth area as well as one 4 top that was close by. There was a couple, Sandy and Mike, that was sitting in the back booth who were so very sweet. We pretty much took over their area to the point that by the time they got ready to leave, they had gone from sitting in the middle of the booth to the very end of the booth. My friend Deb bought them each a glass of wine because they were so very generous and just all around great people. 

Now everyone told me how fabulous their bruschetta was and they were right. I only had a few pieces because I wanted to I talked to everyone and make sure that they were having a good time. But I will be back to enjoy an entire board by myself. Ok maybe not by myself but still, it was damn good. The wine I was drinking was also excellent as well. Hats off to my friend Deb for picking a fabulous red for me. You are the best. 

Special thanks also goes out to our server TJ who rocked it for us all afternoon. He made sure everyone was taken care of when it came to food, drinks, etc. Thank you TJ!!! 

I truly enjoyed myself and I will be back again VERY soon. Thank you again to the entire staff at Postino's on Central for making my 35th birthday extra special.This hotel suited my needs somewhat. It is really smokey and the clientele is somewhat sketchy...makes for good people watching. The food options are great though. The cafe is 24 hrs and the buffet was great. Cabos is a good change up as is the little to go Mexican stand and the Italian place is pretty good. They offered the UFC fight for $20 in their theater which was a pretty good deal. The laundry room is not up to par though. Only 3 washing machines and 3 driers for a 15 floor hotel...need to add one or two more laundry rooms.Pho made Photastic. Number one, they are authentic and taste is spot on. I always stick to the classic beef or chicken pho with a shrimp spring roll. I look forward to one day going out of the boundaries because their menu is so rich in traditional meals however today, this review is to give kudos to their although not fancy setting but non the less amazing food where the price doesn't come close to the value. Come here, you will not regret it!My wife and I had the Crab Cake Eggs Benedict. It is served on a croissant. It sounds ridiculously rich. It is not. It is sublime. The eggs are perfectly poached. The crab cakes are lightly pan fried, the hollandaise is not too thick, the croissant is flakey but not greasy.  Better than I could have possibly imagined.
The kids had a grilled cheese. It looked fine. They ate it without complaint.First let me tell you that I ALWAYS get Pad Thai and it is very good here.  Thai is one of my favorite foods and this is the place we always go to when I am at home.Drove by this little place and wasn't sure about going in.  The window to the street side makes it look like a nothing type place; however, we were going to MIM and decided to try it out.  So glad we didn't judge the book by it's cover!  By the way, they have done alot of remodeling, the owner told us.
But the main thing is the food.  It is GOOD!  I would totally recommend this place to friends.  The crew is friendly. The food is noteworthy.  We were just two and I had the green salad with shawarama (or however you spell it.  I only had the small salad because the server said it will be plenty.  If I were going to be in town tomorrow, I would have taken the rest home.  Chicken was delish, salad was really fresh and the dressing plus the tzatsiki was equally well prepared.  Hubby had the lamb plate with grape leaves(dolma, or however you spell it!) taboule, and gave it a total  thumbs up!  If we are in the neighborhood, and even if we aren't, we will return because we have been looking for a neighborhood Greek restaurant that was as good as this.
Easy parking right in front of the building.If I could give 0 stars I would! We ordered food and paid with a credit card and never got our food. We called and called and they kept brushing us off. Never again stay away from this place what a rip offI'm upgrading my rating to 5* thanks in part to a wonderful service from Sam and the very fresh, melt in your mouth selection of sushi.

If you can get a hold of a Groupon, it is a very good deal, so is their happy hour menu.Best gyros in town, but Cynthia is the real reason we come here. Been here over 25 times and she always remembers our usual order is pleasant and efficient  Cynthia is the face of Mikas Greek.This place was great. My friend recommended I try Pho for the first time ever so I decided to give it a go. We ordered two large soups and mine came with Brisket and Spicy meatball. Huge portions. We were lucky when we came in when we did because half way through our meal the place was packed. Which is awesome for the business but a bit frustrating as a customer because people were standing waiting all around our table and behind us.Appetizers were good. The chicken enchiladas that were 24$ tastes like any you can get in LA or anywhere else for 8$ so I don't recommend that. Go with something else.I have a friend who acts as though every piece of food that enters her mouth has been a gift from the gods. She closes her eyes. She moans. It's quite the sight to witness (aka laugh at). I mean, I LOVE food, but I have never had that type of spiritual experience that she seems to always have.

That is, until I had the steak at L'express. Something came over me. I felt like Sally in When Harry Met Sally (but without the whole faking thing). Now it was my friend's turn to laugh at me. But you know what? I don't even care! That steak. Damn that steak. I will never forget you.Little Caesars is by no means a 4 star pizza place - not even close. But I'm pretty sure everyone knows what to expect when they step inside this place. You're getting a $5 pizza, and if you get what you pay for, don't expect much. 

That being said, I have a family of myself and 3 men. Well, one man and two boys. But those boys are already eating us out of house and home and they're not even out of diapers yet. About once a month we go for some really cheap pizza when things get tight between paychecks and mommy doesn't feel like slaving away in the kitchen. This is always our store of choice, partly from location and also from quality. 

I've dealt with other LCs before on many occasions and have been served pizzas that taste like cardboard with a smattering of marinara sauce. Sometimes the pizzas are clearly old and stale. Sometimes there's no cheese on some of the slices. Not this place. 

I have never once been served an inedible pizza from this LC. The pizzas are ALWAYS fresh - usually many times better than we expect. But since it's a $5 pizza, I say again - don't expect much. The management team must really have it nailed down here. I'm a fan.Happy hour 7 days a week from 11-6
ToDays visit is for a rehab burger Saturday nights can be tuff in the desertWe ordered an anniversary cake, just beautiful! 6 inch cake buttercream? strawberry champagne ... Delish. It was a party in my mouth! I'm ordering another one for my father in laws birthday, I will post a picture. I called in this last order, super nice! This cake shop has found a life client.There's a special kind of taste you expect with a bagel. You want the bread to be fresh and good, the cream cheese to ooze out from the sides and the lox to be smokey and delicious. 

That's what Lox + Schmear is.

Taking a bite out of a bagel loaded with lox, cream cheese, tomato, cucumber, pickled red onions, and dill was taking a bite out of heaven. Before I knew it, the bagel was gone, and I debated with myself if I should get another. 

It benefits greatly that the bagels are from St. Urbain, one of the premier bagel stops in the St. Lawrence Market, so you know the bagel is top quality. 

With a menu that's quite simple, it goes to show that they focus on a select few things that they do well. And, clearly, they do it very very well.The food is delicious but the service is horrible. Everything was dirty. The employees gave you attitude for everything.Excellent food and service,Just like I'm at home, miss you Philippines. The best chicken, Bulalo and  halo haloBrand new, super conveniently located 
 for delicious Hainan chicken. We were immediately welcomed by the friendly owners Tommy & Jessica who explained the menu in detail. My wife had the Hainan chicken and my daughter and I had the Hainan chicken noodle soup. All the chicken they use is free range and is very low on fat. The meat is super juicy and yummy. We found it very reasonably priced for a great portion. Definitely will be back!!!!Great Tepanyaki also has decent sushi (so I am told - not a big fan)
I personally love the Sum Three for lunch - works well and has some good healthy options.
A little on the pricey side, but has a good food selection (if you like Japanese food of course)Pasty are tasty.  Scotch eggs are awesome.  Beer, darts, and pool tables made it a good hangout for us.I've been coming here for dim sum and dinner for many years and it has always been consistently good at a reasonable price!very reasonably priced mac + cheese\/grilled cheese and generous portions! a great spot to go for the ultimate comfort food! the staff was great and totally accommodating! nice set up and enviroment and yummyProbably the closest thing Pittsburgh has to a vegan bakery (such things exist, but are rare, and Pittsburgh's vegan scene is doing pretty well). 

It's a tiny store, but lots of options and friendly staff, and clearly bustling on a busy afternoon before Thanksgiving. I picked up some cupcakes and a donut, which were really good, but not the most awesome I've ever had - compare Pepples Donuts and Timeless Coffee (both Oakland California) and The Flying Apron (Redmond Washington). 

Only 4 stars since labelling and pricing of items could be better, but I'd definitely return for a vegan baking fix.Tried this new place out as I'm a breakfast\/brunch fanatic. Let me just say they did not disappoint. Ambiance was great and our waitress (Taelor) was very attentive. The waitress was extremely knowledgeable on the entire menu so she suggested some delicious eats! It was so good that I even ordered a to go order. Can't wait to head back here and try the rest of the menu! Fast, friendly, attentive staff and delicious! Definitely recommend!Had the Kobe Cheese burger with garlic fries. Hands down amazing! Garlic fries are not too garlicky and the burger was nice and juicy!Love the hash house!  Been there 4 times--4 meals all great.  Bring an appetite!  Wife and I had scrambles--chicken is beeeeesssst.  But her friend had a snickers flappyjack it was boomtasticMy family is a huge fan of Indian food, and this place definitely made the cut. The paper dosai is amazing, and we loved the curry's we've tried this far. This was only our first time here, but I'm sure it's going to be a weekly staple!I went to this Sunrise location for the first time on February 5th, 2015. I would like to mention that I've had eaten at Sunrise locations in Brampton, and I would rate them five stars. The friend I travelled to Sunrise with yesterday and others have warned me about Sunrise - I was about to learn that I had been pampered by the Brampton locations. 

At this Sunrise location, a friend went to get fried chicken and jerk chicken while I ordered oxtail. She placed an order for her and a friend, while I ordered for myself. As soon as I stepped to the side to let other people order, the workers completed forgot my order. My friend continued standing by the front, so they got her order together. 

I'll discuss my friend's order first. She paid for herself first, and all went well.  When she tried to pay for her friend's order with his credit card, she realized that the lady at the cashier entered the wrong amount. The food was on special for approximately $7.20 - the cashier almost charged her $17.20, almost DOUBLE the special price. The woman didn't even have the courtesy to apologize for her mistake. 

We both decided to order festival. My friend was asking me why they were so dark. I foolishly assumed it was because they cook it a little differently. Long story short, the festival was burnt, and would have been completely inedible without oxtail gravy. 

I thought about opening my oxtail to look at it, but then decided to open it when we got back to the office - BIG MISTAKE. I had asked them for no rice, just oxtail, in a regular container. There were no vegetables and there was barely enough oxtail to cover the bottom of the container. I might as well as have just taken the small container, instead of paying how much money for a spoonful of oxtail. 

I also ordered carrot juice there from the brand "Real Deal." It was edible, but it was horrid.  The closest thing I can describe the taste to is baby carrot mush or carrot soup. No amount of shaking could save this drink. I drank it, as carrot juice can be expensive, but the experience was awful While I can't entirely blame a restaurant for the drinks it carries, there is some responsibility here. While they did not make the drink, housing it in your restaurant signifies your endorsement and promotion of the brand. I was expecting real carrot juice, not glorified sewage. 

I hate writing negative reviews, but this experience has sincerely vexed my spirit. I am so not impressed. I am all for supporting black-owned establishments, but I will not do so if I have to endure poor quality service. This is the 21st century: it's time to do better.  If you are in the Dixie\/Eglington area and you are craving Caribbean food, Shandra's Roti Shop is a great place to be. I'm sure Google can offer better alternatives as well. I implore everyone reading this post, kindly do not buy food at Sunrise's Rockwood Mall location.The BEST Orange Chicken I have ever had in my life!!!! Fast professional delivery.  Crab Puffs are spectacular. Love the container they deliver the chicken easy to store for the next day. Definitely will be a new favorite for me. They deserve 5 STARS all the way across the board.It's a real joy to have a high quality seafood restaurant and market located nearby. I have been a regular customer of the seafood market and finally found a high quality alternative to pricy groceries also in the neighborhood. The Turbot and Grouper are both a refreshing treat and the management is also most helpful.Big in Japan Bar - hidden cocktail spot with amazing drinks, intimate and upscale ambiance, great date spot, and charming and unobtrusive service

This cocktail lounge is hard to find with no visible signs outside, but worth it for the amazing drinks and unique atmosphere. To find it, look out for the black door with graffiti next to Patati Patata.

Once you enter, you will walk through a narrow corridor and be greeted by the rows of candles lining the table top. The long wooden bar snakes around the room, and branches out in different sections, creating privacy between groups. Bottles of whiskey hanging from the ceiling add to the unique decor. For you whiskey connoisseurs, you can buy your own bottle of Japanese whiskey, leave it at the bar where they will safely attach it to the ceiling until your next visit! 

Drinks: great selection of gin and rum based cocktails, along with sakes, wine and umeshu
Ambiance: intimate and upscale
Who to bring: a special someone or a small group of friends
Service: Attentive but unobtrusive
Price: average $10-15 for a cocktailA delicious and amazing Mexican food experience! Very authentic (having visited Mexico City recently), very tasty food, amazing margaritas and friendly service. My fav Mexican restaurant in Toronto by far.I stayed here for 11 nights. In that time my room was cleaned exactly 3 times. I believe that room not being cleaned five days in a row is not a signature gesture of a good hotel.Great little place to come have a drink 
And little quick stop if you're walking  the strip and you want a quick sit down drink and snacks 
They have a greasy little snack menu 
Great chips and salsa and guacamole
Prices are ok 
Drinks can use a little help 
Service was great tonight that we came the man that served us loves what he does and he was amazing 
Restrooms are all the way back there if you are sitting outside 
Inside have a cute little country touchGood local spot for a quick bite & drinks. Solid good food. This place was semi-forgotten by me until recently, once on a "snow" day and another time on a late Sunday night. For the most part, you can always count on this place being open and serving food. 

I'm a fan of the $4 house white russian - it's like dessert first, dinner later. For meal, both times I had their sliders combo - good meatloaf (next time I will ask for more gravy), great fried fish & okay chicken parm. Only downside is their side - only chips comes with sandwiches. Or you can pay extra for other side options (even fries). BUT - when you check in on Yelp, it has a Yelp offer for side order. They let me have the chili mac and it was delish and HUGE. I know everyone loves their wings here - they are ok in my book, small in size, pretty hot for mild buffalo, and generally speaking I think their other food offerings are more satisfying.

Limited parking behind the building. so good luck.

Way to go Lebowski for keeping up the good work all these years!Just tried to order the same takeout order I've had on 3 prior occasions, this time a "Jessica" answered the phone & seemed  oblivious. She did not know that there is a " Gus special" pizza and that they carried a baked wings on their menu.

I had to repeat myself three times for her to understand my order, I asked for the manager and she told me that he will be back and he never took my call. 

Next time I'll try Don's New York pizza which is right across the street, I read that they have great customer service.I miss this place so much. I only lived in LV for one semester, before I moved back home to Reno. I am so thankful that I was introduced to this place, the place where I lost my KBBQ-ginity. Since leaving Vegas, I have been to many Korean bbq restaurants, but none compare to Tofu Hut.  I wish there was a tofu hut convenient everywhere I go! I miss it so much; the delicious sides, sauces, salad, THE MEATS. Everything about this place is perfect. The price? AMAZING.  I have heard a lot of rumors about this place being unclean, but I don't even care their food is to die for. Some of my friends hate tofu hut, so Im assuming its a hit or miss for everyone.  But for me its a hit straight to my heart. I miss this place so much and I plan on going every time I visit Vegas.Service was friendly and attentive. The beef brisket sandwich was awful. It was dried out beef, small quantity (not at all like the menu photo), and no BBQ sauce (needed to ask). The fajita was flavorless and the teeny tiny container of salsa was seriously a LOL moment. Overall, bad food experience and we won't return. Disappointing lunch. The venue was enjoyable due to country theme, too bad the food was terrible. Cant recommend.Overall Awful, had the fried calamari which was tender,so that was great, however, the portion should have been larger (calamari is so inexpensive) the sauce was too sweet and loaded with sugar & oregano (a little oregano is for pizza-not sauce -basil goes in sauce). The eggplant parm was served over a small amount of pasta which should be served separately-was awful -not fresh -was mushy -the same sweet thick sauce. Maggianos needs to fix there red sauce and provolone doesn't go on eggplant parmigiana. The bread on the table was good tho.Best breakfast sandwiches in town at unbeatable prices. I just wish the truck was here 24\/7.Whenever I go here, I always get the filet mignon and it never fails me! It's always so good and they always make it just right.Four of us came in late for drinks after a game, and sat at the bar. Once the bartender came out we were served and visited with her. She didn't rush us, and the drinks were good. Has a nice-looking restaurant, too.We came to town for the Piits Marathon. We loved this place. Delicious Sushi, great service and so friendly. We will return next year!!I asked for the dressing on the side so my salad wouldn't get soggy however when I got home it was already soggy. It's way too expensive for what you get. I paid extra for meat and they gave me a few tiny pieces of chicken... The salads are already expensive plus if you want some protein you have to pay like $3.00. It's totally not worth it. If you want a good salad I suggest order from a restaurants and pick it up if you want it to go.Finally tried this place out based on burger recommendations. I tried the steak burger BUT those crispy Brussels sprouts with chorizo  were the real star of the show! I would eat Brussels sprouts everyday if I could get them to taste like that! 
So I ordered the burger well done and I guess I shouldn't have - it was a bit charred and the flavor was cooked out of it. My hubby had the burger cooked medium and he liked it ok, maybe in top 10. 
‍I mean food was okay. A lot of choices as per buffet goes. And the sushi was good

It's the customer service that brings it down to 2 stars. I got 2 free dinner coupons from my mom and I showed the hostess before we came in and she said they were still valid. So we ate and come time to pay, our waiter said that you can only use one coupon per purchase. Since I live downtown, I don't have time to come back often and these coupons are expiring, I asked if we could just split the bill. In my mind it works as 2 purchases if you split. The manager came and told us their computer can't split 2 bills. Which makes absolutely no sense. Why can't they just put in one adult dinner for each bill? 

Anyways manager was not helpful at all and the hostess failed to mention that only one coupon can be used per table.

Closes at 9:30 on a Friday night. Repeating 5 song playlist gets annoying. Very disappointingThis review is long overdue. Knowledgeable and courteous servers. Intimate but comfortable atmosphere, and delicious food. I still find myself craving their Ricotta Gnocchi and cannot wait to go back!The service is horrible. I just left as I had a flight but because it took so long to get service and then the food I got about three bites. The staff were hanging about the bar complaining about the other staff, that creates a horrible atmosphere. I fly here fairly often and will step foot in this place againCame here to check out the food as we are considering using them to cater an event. We tried (and liked) everything. Brisket, pulled chicken were juicy and tender. Mac & cheese was gooey and smokey. Jalapeño deviled eggs were delicious with a kick. I liked the potato salad because it wasn't potatoes swimming in mayonnaise. Fried okra was frozen, but very good. The hush puppies are very nice...not too dry and a little sweet. Banana pudding was good...not the best I've had, but good. We ate here on a Sunday afternoon right at 12:00. They stayed moderately busy the whole time, but there were plenty of tables open, so this seems like it would be a good place for after church lunch.Love the atmosphere in this Paris-like alley.I stopped in here on my way back up to Flagstaff. My doggie needed a bathroom break and I desperately needed a coffee. I pulled in not knowing what to expect but was delighted with the outcome. I ordered a Java Chip frappe and a banana loaf, both of which were delicious. The staff wasn't overly friendly but not rude. And I always appreciate a place with a clean bathroom.I went last night for a birthday dinner.  First, I was very disappointed in my wine pour.  For $18 a glass, you would think you would get a regular\/decent pour.  It was below the average wine pour at most places.  I ordered the salmon and it was okay.  Not much flavor to it, even though it is covered in a sauce.  The others that I was with said there entrees were also bland with not much taste to them.  Two people ordered the sliders and they came out pink on the inside.  The waiter never returned to check on our food, so we weren't able to return them or ask for them to be cooked more.  The French fries were good, but that was about it for us.  For the money, I would choose a different spot.Oh, I like Sonic. Beat me with a wet noodle. I made Darren take me to one on Memorial Day weekend since it had been years. I liked the breakfast burrito I had (You can also order breakfast all day) as well as the milkshake (their ice cream is sooo good). It's a retro and fun place to go and reminds me of Jerry's Curb Side in Bridgewater. The service is great and I like their intercom system.This place is to die for delicious. I've been three times and never did it once disappoint. Usually we get a glass of wine, an appetizer or cheese board, our entrée followed by a digestif. We've had a variety of their pasta dishes and they are all beyond amazing.

I tend to be picky in terms of quality of food and know what to expect since I have culinary training. This place definitely assures quality in every dish. The pasta is always fresh. It seems that their menu compromises of pastas that are easier to make fresh. It is always cooked al-dente. The sauces are made from scratch and perfectly seasoned. 

The staff is also very kind and knowledgeable.
We love coming here and feel that it is very reasonably priced for the quality of the food and the whole experience. I would highly recommend NODO.So in love! The customer service was AMAZING the moment I walked through the door. I felt more than welcomed. One of the employees was very personable. She wanted to know if I was from here. It's very clean. The white walls, soft music and natural lighting makes this place EVERYTHING I look for in a study environment. I'll be here the next 3-4 week's daily studying for my boards! I couldn't be happier. The menu is great. I ordered a care caramel. It's smooth and tasty!!!! Love this place! FIVE STARS without hesitation!One of the best pizza places
We have been to Five50 multiple times since coming to Las Vegas and we have never been disappointed. Their selection is perfect, had multiple pizzas from the menu and have loved every single one. 

The only thing I wish was available is that they could deliver to guest staying at the hotel.My wife and I love their pizza, but if our time is limited, or we want to eat healthier, we order the sandwich and salad! Both are very good. And the salad that comes with the sandwich is a good size! I believe the dressing are house made, and are very good!Picture this:  2001, Cleveland Heights.  A suburban-Akron recent high school graduate finally discovers parts of Cleveland that aren't Fat Fish Blue, Peabody's, or a "Battle of the Bands" venue.  While touring JCU with some friends who were attending we stumbled upon Coventry and all the magic it holds.  It was then, my friends, that my love affair with BD's started.

My friends and I made weekly trips up to Coventry to check out the shops, grab some BD's, and explore the area.  This place has it all right: all-you-can-eat-make-your-own-stir-fry.  Chicken, read meats, fish, vegetables, tofu, sauces, spices, everything.  You can make a new recipe every time and never run out of options.  My personal favorite bowl consisted of chicken, baby corns, carrot sticks, pineapple, edamame, broccoli, pasta noodles, a ladle of bottom tickler and a ladle of peanut sauce to balance it all out.  Throw in some cajun seasoning and lemon pepper, wrap it in a flour tortilla with some brown rice, and you've got yourself some heaven in a bowl!  Also, they bang an annoying gong and bring you a free dessert if it was your birthday.  I can't tell you exactly how many "birthdays" I've had here ;)

We continued to stop in weekly until we all went our separate ways for college.  Down in Athens I could never find something quite on par with BD's.  However, every time I came back up to the Cleveland-area for break or to visit friends, you betcha we stopped in at BD's.  Trust that.

As all good things seem to come to an end, so did my time in NE Ohio.  After graduating college I moved away to Chicago and started anew.  Sure, we have Flat Top Grill here, but it isn't quite the same as BD's.  I've heard that there are BD's in two far NW and SW suburbs, but I haven't been able to make it out there.  Finally, on my random trip home this past weekend, I was able to reunite with BD's and get my Mongolian BBQ on.  A 5 year sabbatical was entirely too long.  Since they've added new items and sauces to the buffet, t took me a couple bowls to really get my groove back and make the perfect bowl.  After playing around with the different sauces and spices I was able to come up with some good eats.  Overall, -1 star for discontinuing the bottom tickler sauce.  It was the best.  Don't mess with the best.

It'll be nice to get back up here again over the holidays when a bunch of my friends from "the gang" are in town, too.  The place is delicious, budget-friendly, and can satisfy even the pickiest (or "health-conscious") of appeties.  Also, allergy-sensitive patrons ARE welcome - just let them know and they will cook your meal separately in the back.I had the 24oz Ribeye and it was great. Service we excellent and the prices were as expected. This is still not one of the best steakhouses but if your in Vegas and you love steak you have to try this place. Stripsteak and Gallaghers are better but this place was still very very good.I cannot say enough about this incredible dining experience. Manager Sergio Torrisi provided the most enjoyable and memorable evening of exquisite Italian Seafood imaginable. From the appetizers to the desserts, everything was amazing. The "Bravo's Top Chef" dinner menu is the way to go for your first visit, you will love everything and want to go back tomorrow. 
An evening we will never forget and we will tell everyone we know "you have to go, ask for Sergio and tell him Marton and Lisa sent you," Bravo!!Mmm! Loved my everything bagel with jalapeño creme cheese 
Delicious and fresh  
I loved the home-y vibe of this place 
They pack on the cheese so be prepared for a delicious messMy husband took me here for my birthday, had reservations at 7. Very nice atmosphere, a bar area with a piano player and then a two layered dining rooms overlooking Lake Erie and Cleveland. Great view. Teri was our waitress, she was friendly, fun and helpful. We shared the Pierogies, they were awesome. Wish you got more then 3 because they aren't very big but great all the same. I got the filet, I always have them butterfly it and cook it medium well plus. It was spot on, full of flavor. My husband got the scallops, he said those were amazing too. Prices are pretty equal to other upscale restaurants. Will definitely recommend and come back.When I first arrived, I went to the ladies room first, where an employee was texting in the middle of the room, left when I went into a stall, and was still texting in the alcove when I came out. I went up to the hostess stand, no one was there for a couple minutes. Turns out the texting employee was the hostess. Well, at least she has her priorities straight! I've come to this Cracker Barrel a few times over the years. It is consistently inconsistent. I got the fried chicken tenderloins with hash brown casserole and dumplings. The dumplings get an A+, they were actually hot for a change. The hash brown casserole was not hot and was kind of crusty and probably not from today. The chicken tenders were fine. The waitress, P'Harris, was just doing her job, no enthusiasm whatsoever.Wow, people were not kidding about the horrendous service here, or the incredibly high noise level.  The teriyaki chicken was pretty awful, though the happy hour shumai and tempura were okay.  The easiest requests are not entertained (choosing flavors of mochi ice cream - thank goodness for Haagen-Dazs).  Way overpriced too, and I won't be back.First and last time for this restaurant. Very small, I felt I was in a tin can. Owner and his wife went on chatting with customers for excessive amount of time while my wife and I waited patiently for service. Other employees looked at us like we weren't even there. People stood around ignoring us. After much patience we got up and walked out. Several employees looked at us but nobody asked if anything was wrong or thanked us for our business.

DONE!!!!!!!!! Couldn't even comment on the quality of the food, because we never had a chance to try it.I don't do brunch often, but when I do I will drive my happy butt right back here. Despite being a PACKED place (I mean it when I say packed), we were seated really quickly. The food was AMAZING. I couldn't believe that 3\/3 appetizers we ordered tasted phenomenal. We ordered the pesto torte ($11), chicken flautas ($10), and the pastry basket ($10). Even thinking back on it, I can't figure out which I liked best. The three of us then each ordered an entree. I got the jerk fried chicken and waffles ($17), one of my friends got the New-Jamaican Omelet ($14) and the other got the grilled chicken sandwich ($14). Everything tasted so different than what I've ever tried in Las Vegas. It is a New Mexico-Jamaican fusion style (what!?) that I really dig. The jerk chicken has a serious kick to it and really awakens the taste buds! We stuck to water because we didn't want to indulge in the $32 bottomless mimosas deal, although we wanted to. One qualm that we had was that our server seemed a bit scattered. He didn't come to check on us and forgot a couple of our requests until we managed to catch him a second time around. I know they were busy, but it is a tiny bit troubling when you want hot sauce and don't want to finish your food until it gets to the table. Still, I will certainly be back!First time at this place. You son wanted to try it out.  Plus we were starving from shopping.  Uuhm I will say it's a nice place but I'm not to fond of the food. The burger was extremely red so when you go remember to ask for it to be extra Well done ( if rare isn't your thing). OK I will say the chicken burger was good the chicken is fried and I added bacon (yummy)  and cheese. The first time they made it the cheese was slapped on like a cold sandwich (yuk this is a burger so I sent back) then the second time it was made they forgot the bacon. Finally the third time it was made right and the manager credited the burger from our bill.  He was nice!  Meanwhile while I was waiting we are our fries and shake it was good (can't go wrong on fries and a shake)My husband and I love this place so much that we had our rehearsal dinner here.  They are sooooo nice and accommodating - they did not bat an eyelash when we called to make a reservation for 20 people, and they let us bring our own birthday dessert for one of our party.  They set up a nice long table for us and even went around taking our orders (normally it's counter service).  The staff is always the sweetest.  The food is always the bombest.  My favorites are the lengua and carne asada tacos, but my parents love their burritos (all of them, which is saying a lot for a traditional first-gen Chinese couple) and their quesadillas are spot on.  Taco Sahuaro has ruined me for all other taco places.  How do they make their tortillas so delicious????I have been ordering delivery from Szechuan Express for about 7 years now. The food is consistently delicious and the staff are extremely friendly. The prices are good and the delivery menu has coupons available. Delivery is fast and the food is always hot. I've never been in the restaurant itself, so I cannot speak to that aspect. I will continue ordering their food for many years to come. **HIGHLY RECOMMENDED**Been here a few times, I try not to hang out in Avondale for "fun" if I can avoid it...but since Majerle's is close, this is a decent option.  However, I will never again order a bowl of fresh fruit for $5 because it is just NOT worth it.  The dish was tiny, there was hardly any variety (or fruit, for that matter), and the pineapple was absolutely tasteless.  I've never had worse pineapple in my life, TBH.  But as far as drinks go, my beers were reliable and inexpensive. :)  And apparently my husband's tacos were very, very good.  Service was good, as well.What a great spot! The space itself is awesome - great seating, comfortable chairs, lots of natural light, very welcoming, and the staff was super friendly. The pizza is awesome, and the pepperoni is actually buffalo, which tasted awesome. The salad was really good too - love the dressing! Will definitely be back!Tried this place last weekend on the advice of Rachel C.  That lady knows her sushi - the fish was top quality and they had some interesting rolls and combinations.  The crazy tuna and flower roll were the real standouts of the evening.  Plus it's BYO... always a bonus.  

I was glad we had a reservation for dinner; the place was packed and we would have been waiting a while with our group of 6 had we not called ahead.This place was recommended by the hostess we were having dinner at.. When my friend and I got here we both thought this place was cute .. To me it looked like a hole in the wall coffee shop that offers live music.. The coffee itself wasn't bad.. The space was small and kinda cramp towards the back.. But it looked like they offer board games and random books to look at while u and ur friends have your coffee..I'm a McDonalds person usually so I know how high standards in service go, but my co workers and I refuse to keep coming here because the drive thru service is super rude. One of the first times I came here, I tried and ordered off the value menu for lunch but I ended up making my meal a combo suggested by the drive thru operator, and it actually made my meal more expensive, it wasn't helpful at all. Will not visit again unless I'm super desperately hungry.We went here for a team lunch with coworkers during Toronto's "Summerlicious" event (set menus at participating restaurants). 

About half the table (10 of us) ordered off of the Summerlicious menu, myself included,  while the others had brunch \/ breakfast fare.

I ordered the lamb belly sandwich and it was OK. Passable, but would not get again. Fries were over done. Spring mix salad was a bit elderly, but pretty plain. 

A negative review, right? Yes, but I may go back to do brunch.

Many other patrons were having egg items off the brunch menu and they all looked great. 4 of my coworkers did as well and they were all very happy with their selections; one even said "2nd best eggs Benny that he has ever had".

Give it a try. The group consensus was that the set menu main items were meh (except for the veggie dish...thstvwas very much enjoyed). The starters were all good. I had the beet salad, another had the salmon saviche, and 2 the gazpacho.  All liked the appys.

Desserts were ok. The lemon curd was very good. The panacotta tasted alright but the consistency was too gelatinous.

Staff was friendly and attentive. Atmosphere was casual. We sat on the patio. Recommended.

All in all, give brunch a try for sure. Dinner, why not?  Sometimes a so so experience is the outlier, not the norm.Beautiful location, plenty of parking, hometown service, but upscale food.

First time here I had the Christmas Clem Salad Sandwich.  Grapes, capers, cranberries, Grider, charred sweet onion, mixed greens on a challah roll.  Upgraded to the fries.  Omg! It was wonderful- a great combination of flavours that honours the classic.  Home made dipping sauces- very, truffle ketchup, and aioli were wonderful!  Dining companion raved about the Salmon BLT.

So good ...  we came back today. Time to try out the slow cooked turkey and the ham and cheese croissant... 

The turkey was fantastic.  The sprouts, bacon, avocado - perfect. Love the tries with a hint of rosemary.  We both loved our sammies. Home run!Always extremely friendly. I enjoy coming to this location. Happy hour has good prices as well. Very mom and pop feel.I was there yesterday morning, breakfast time is usually busy. I ordered a breakfast combo which comes with a coffee, hash brown and a breakfast sandwich. 

Its good that Tim Horton hires all cultures, gives every one a chance to work but they should put the employees that speak English well in the front. I had a terrible experience with a lady who took  my order, it seemed she did not understand what i asked for and punched in the wrong order. 

It was frustrating, by then my coffee was almost cold.Dined in for lunch on a Thursday. I ordered the shaved chicken Greek plate. The chicken was well seasoned and well cooked, not overdone and the tzatziki sauce was perfect. The pita bread was fresh, warm, soft and chewy. Overall it was an excellent , savoury meal.How do you get away with charging $8 for an order of french fries?  Open a hipster joint and call them by a fancy foreign name.  How does 'poutine' sound?  A nice French foerign ring to it, eh?  At any other restaurant a plate of fries with a tiny scoop of chili and a few cheese crumbles would cost about $2.95.  And you know the hot dogs they sell at gas stations - the ones in the glass-enclosed griller gizmos - the hot dogs that have turned so long on the hot pipes they've been transformed into dessicated meat cylinders?  Well, that's what our hot dogs were like; overcooked is an understatement. And what kind of place serves hot dogs without having some mustard on the table?  We had to ask and were brought a tiny steel cup of the stuff.  Come on, mustard is not that expensive.  I guess we should feel lucky we weren't charged extra.  

My suggestion?  If you want a good hot dog (instead of a gourmet 'experience') find a decent coney: you'll have better food and save money.Had an a-la-carte dinner here. Very good, fresh, spicy dishes. Dishes have an authentic Punjabi flavor. There is dinner buffet till 9pm, for $10. 
Decent service and comfortable ambiance. 
Probably the best budget Indian cuisine in Tempe. 
Best dish: Paneer Tikka Masala.I made a healthy decision to eat healthy had a fruit cup instead of hash browns, to make this choice was charged .50 more.
I will not give restaurants my business for not supporting healthy eating buy charging more . ( and what I did get cost less on weekdays )Went here for the first time today and left a very happy and full customer! I will definitely be back. I wasn't sure how it all worked as far as getting food and other things but their staff was very friendly and more than happy to help. There food is extremely tasty compared to other Mongolian food restaurants that I have been to. I ordered the large bowl and what a mistake that was, in the best way possible! So much food for such a great price! I will definitely come back here! :)Okay so I love love LOVE this place!!!!!! 
It's absolutely amazing!! My friend and I went It to give It a try, first time ever trying Indian food and my oh my It was so delicious. The servers were so sweet and kind! This is our new fav spot!!!!If you have no time to grab something before arriving at the airport, Paradise Bakery may be one of the best food choices you can find.

Yes, it offers over-priced mediocre food as expected, but I appreciated the fact they offered a vegetarian sandwich ($8 or so) along with some pasta salad ($5). The sandwich had some cucumber, lettuce, tomato, and Havarti (my favourite cheese) and came with a chocolate chip cookies. The pasta salad was overly dressed, but it had some veggies in it and tasted OK.

In a pinch, this place will do, but we all know it is best to leave early so that you can get something decent to eat before arriving at the airport!My husband surprised me with a Birthday party at this location . The staff was excellent and went the extra mile for me and my guest the whole time. Great place to have a celebration, no matter the age.Maybe we came at a bad time before going to a 5:30 show to see Gordie Brown. First this is not a cheap buffet and there are no local discounts. We were seated and because of the early time there were very few people here. We had to get our own drinks. First I tried jerk chicken wings, rice pilaf and green beans from the American section on far left side. All had good spice flavor but chicken had been sitting too long and was hard. Green beans were raw inside which is a recipe for disaster (GAS)!! Rice was okay. I tried a couple more thing but yuck.Benjamin's is a new bar taking over BRiX's old space (and I believe by the same owners) after zoning issues caused them to close their doors. Their menu is focused, offering about a half-dozen varieties of burger, some available as house-made veggie burgers, and gluten-free buns upon request. Three sides and a few appetizers ranging from pretzels to pate are also on the menu.

The space is narrow, with a large bar sitting on the right half and a handful of tables on the left. At the far end of the bar is where the cooking appears to take place, and beyond that in a separate room is a billiards room(And maybe more, I didn't venture inside). Arriving on a Saturday evening, there were a few sporadic diners, but plenty of space even for a large walk-in party. 

In addition to their full bar, Benjamin's has a beer and wine menu - no drafts though, currently at least. Their can\/bottle menu has a few craft and local favorites in addition to common macro selections. The prices are reasonable, and their daily happy hours can make this bar a steal(4:30-6:30 - ranging from $1 PBR to $4 wine).

We started off with the mini pretzels and truffle mustard($2). The truffle mustard was as it sounds: Mustard with a splash of earthy truffle flavor that really comes through. I'm not sure it's my favorite truffle-flavored condiment, but it was tasty. The pretzels themselves appeared to be regular store-bought mini pretzels.

I chose a burger with green chilis, salsa, and chipotle sour cream and a side of home fries($9), while my friend decided on an egg, bacon, and hot sauce mayo burger with slaw($11), both medium.  The food came quickly and immediately the first thing I noticed is that my burger was entirely raw. The server was happy to correct the error and did so quickly. In the meantime I had some of my homefries, which were good, but just homefries. I would really prefer french fries, but I'm not sure they have a fryer here.

My burger came back warm and cooked to a nice medium. Eating these burgers is a messy task - they are juicy to the point of excess and leave your area soaked. Unfortunately, I found the flavor of the burgers to be lacking, and my toppings didn't really didn't add much. My friend agreed that his tasted a bit bland.

Because Benjamin's is new, I would like to go back and give them another shot, but there are a lot of places to get an excellent burger in Pittsburgh, so they're entering a market with some pretty tough competition - especially if their menu remains as focused as it is. I do like their attempt at combining a classy atmosphere with spruced-up blue-collar food, but at some points it felt more like an identity crisis than a synergy. They appear to be working at it constantly, though, so I'm hopeful that in time, Benjamins will shineThe portion looked small at first but it was definitely filling and tasty. My husband and I ordered butter squid, sushi and sashimi combo, fire and ice rolls and mochi green tea ice cream. It was filling and tasty.This is as good as frozen custard gets, and I've travelled a lot.  I grew up going to school at Edgewood, just up the hill from here.  I have fond memories of frozen custard after playing in the park along the lakeside.  A nice stop to add to this is Pasquel's, right across the street.  Let the frozen custard temper the hot sauce of the it's tex-mex.Another great addition to downtown!!! I love that they use the same kind of tortillas you would find in Mexico. Interesting history in this church. I love how they kept a lot of the original church in the remodel. At this moment I am eating their salsa which is perfect. Spicy but not like you ate the sun. The tacos are Mexico meets urban. Super creative. I'll be back for sure!I am not a Chinese food lover, I eat only a few dishes so this review is specific to those.

Buffet:
No generals chicken
Sesame chicken tasted old, tough. Took only 2 bites.
Bourbon chicken was pretty good.
Sweet and sour chicken was pretty plain, as it normally is.
Teriyaki chicken was good.
Ribs were ok, sweet and sticky.
Sugar donuts were dense.  Did not enjoy.

Not a huge buffet, but, they had some things I don't normally see.

Ckean, kept well stocked.The food is not exciting but it's a great spot after a Giant's spring training game.  It will be crowded with lots of fun loving people.  Their small street tacos are worth the price, but otherwise it is mostly a place for inexpensive, but ordinary, margaritas.We enjoyed the Frrrozen Hot Chocolate and a Marguerite Pizza.  My wife considered the Frrrozen Hot Chocolate as delicious even after all the chocolate and rich food we indulged in LV.  Since I was craving pizza I ordered the Marguerite Pizza, a thin soft crust with a sweet tomato sauce, mozzarella and basil it was good by not the best I had.  If you are looking for a tart alcoholic drink then I highly recommend the Madras Mojito served  real cranberries and crushed mint leaves.  It was the best Mojito I have had since Fronterra Grill - Chicago.  

Seating hostess was not attentive, however our waitress was so fantastic we tipped extra.  

This plus was a lot of fun just to hang out on the patio, relax and gaze at Caesars Palace to the left and Las Vegas Blvd to the right.Sooooooo yummy! Was there Saturday night with my parents and two nieces. Thank you Chris for welcoming us and thank you Lindsay, our server, for being so lovely.  The food was awesome - haddock and chips, shrimp po-boy, and two yankee burgers, one sans bun.  I can't wait to go back.  Thank you Chip+Malt.    :)Excellent place for brunch! They have a very unique menu with a lot of choices. I got the merguez and pierogi hash, mostly because it had lamb which I loved (a little bit on the undercooked side but safe to eat). The kale and vegetables were on the saltier side but it balanced well with the pierogies. I ate with a group and we also shared some donut holes which I wasn't a big fan of because it was very greasy. Prices are good for the amount and quality you get and there's also a lot of seating so it's good for groups.I've been to Real Sports Bar several times, and though the girls working the door could use some lessons in customer service, it's my favourite place in Toronto to grab a beer and burger to watch a game - any game, thanks to the seemingly infinite number of television screens in the place.

When I've made reservations, I've been seated  in the 'dining area' where the booths have private TV screens and iPod docking stations. Nice, but not as lively as the main bar area, where I've sat when arriving without prior reservations (one rare time I got a table for two almost immediately; other times had to stake out a few spots and snag some bar seating 30-60 minutes after arriving).

The food is standard pub fare - burgers and fries are usually done well. Poutine could be better if they used cheese curds rather than pieces of melted mozzarella.  Nacho platters are massive.This place is my spot. Drip coffee that is the best in town, go with the bold European blend or the Vanilla blend. Love those egg bagel sandwiches, the turkey sausage or the spinach mushroom swiss are the best in my opinion. The service is quick, and the staff is extremely friendly. They even know me by name in there. I do love this place.One of my favorite pho place in Vegas. Came here regularly always ordered the pho. They are delicious. I also tried several other menus before, fried rice, fried noodle, chicken wings, lunch special. They are all delicious. Everything in a good price. The master always have a great service.I've been here a few times now and they never disappoint! The environment and atmosphere is always uplifting and makes for a great place to take the family. I love the food here and look forward to more visits and trying out more of the menu. The chicken lettuce wraps are the bomb though as I've got needs both times. I would highly recommend this place and will definitely be coming back with my family and friendsI love to walk into a local business and see an owner whose passion for what they do shines so brightly. That's how I feel about Sean. 

I don't buy a ton of seafood to cook for myself. Sometimes I find fresh fish counters intimidating. Not here. I can walk in completely clueless, and leave happy. Everyone here is nice and helpful. I feel like Sean knows fish like I know Friends sitcom trivia. (Aka that means he's a certified expert)

Along with fresh offerings of their own, Catch On also supports local businesses and carries products from others. I think one of the coolest things they do here is Taco Tuesday. The kits make 6 tacos. They come with tortillas hand made locally at La Lupita, house made fresh salsa from Three Amigos Mexican Restaurant, taco seasoning from The Savory Spice Shop, mahi mahi, slaw, an avocado, and a lime. Kit is just $16. Steal. You could probably have dinner ready in 10 minutes. 

Yes, this is going to be a little more pricier than your Harris Teeter. But, it's better quality and still comparable and even better priced than a lot of the other seafood places around town. Keep up the good work Sean and crew. Love having you guys just five minutes down the road from my house.Butter chicken was good. Chicken Tikka was tough (never had it like that before so disappointed).  Atmosphere very nice. Service was strange.  I had to put my hand up everytime we needed something as the server stood at the front of the restaurant.I decided to try this place based on everyone reviews and love it. Granted I always get the same thing. The #26 Pho Tai  Sliced flank steak rice noodle soups. Love the condiments.Well...perhaps because we love Tom Colicchio on Top Chef so much, it made everything seem better and cooler and tastier!

If I were to ever go back, I would get the Hangar steak. It was the tastiest cut of meat between the 4 dishes my friends & I ordered. My next favorite was the braised short ribs.

I thought my steak was OK....the first one came out bleeding so I sent it back. The second steak (a brand new cut of meat) was a bit on the chewy side. I think they don't season it too much so you can really just enjoy the beef flavor (a la Arnie Morton's).

Aside from the Hangar, the sides also won me over....I got the Sunchokes (Jerusalem Artichokes! Remember when Harold cooked with them in the Napa challenge in the previous season?) and they went well with the meat. My friend ordered the sauteed wild mushrooms & they were really really good too!

The service here is fantastic and I really enjoyed the atmosphere & decor of the place. They were so kind to us & even gave us a creme brulee with fresh vanilla beans on the house to share! (I ordered the Meyer Lemon sorbet which was painfully sour....so if you don't like sour...stay away from it!)YUCK!  Will never come back.  Ordered chili and it was in one word, NASTY!  Had to ask for the cheese and onions and there was mold on the cheese.  Asked for a side salad with dressing on the side.  Surprise! It was poured all over my salad.Not too sure how to think about this place yet. But i'll tell you about the 3 things I got.

Cabeza Taco - AMAZING. rich, smooth, and with the cut of the salsa from the salsa bar, really how you want one of these bad boys to taste!

Chorizo Taco - sorta dry, which despite how rich i'm sure the meat was is a bit shocking.

Al Pastor Torta - really quite terrible. The whole thing was dry and the pastor was bland. There wasn't any mayo or cheese in there to moisten it up and as a restaurant, that based on it's various graphics bills itself as a pastor joint you'd think they'd be able to do better.

I guess maybe the should advertise with pictures of cabeza? probably not because cabeza looks sorta gnarly but lawwwd its' goodGreat prices!  Large, eclectic menu and super fast and friendly service.  We sat on the patio and enjoyed the tiki bar type setting.  So many unusual decorative items they are a conversation piece in themselves. Fun drink coasters with brain teasers.  No fun details were overlooked.  

The waitstaff tag teams all the tables so patrons have everything they need and there is a fantastic team environment.  

I had the white trash turkey burger with onion rings.  The next time I will order something different.  I couldn't taste the provolone cheese, and the turkey burger tasted just like beef.  So much so,
I needed to double check!  The onion rings are a huge portion...  Don't even attempt to eat it alone.

The entire family can eat here without breaking the budget.  Parking is way on the other side of the restaurant. On Friday there is an evening rush that starts around seven.  Make sure you get there before then.

An umbrella fell on my sisters head and they deducted $3.75  from our check, which is the reason this place didn't earn four stars.I love diner food.  The menu is huge, the portions are huge, and the bill is small.  The coffee is tasty and you can have breakfast all day.  What's not to like?

My go-to for the first time at a new diner is a turkey club.  It's a sandwich I won't make at home because it's rare I have all the ingredients on-hand, but an easy sammie to execute at any level.  I like it with honey mustard over mayo, on white toast, with a pickle.  And Drew's knocked it out of the park for one reason: it's real, sliced turkey!!!  Not some processed, gelatinous deli meat, but actual sliced turkey!  I couldn't believe it and now I'm spoiled on club sandwiches for a long time.  And the honey mustard--house made!  Excellent!Great bar pizza and pool tables! Came here alot since it was in downtown!First time here, it was nice we sat outside and the weather was perfect they had a jazz band that starts at 7:30 on Friday nights. Good timesI was craving for buttery biscuits all week and decided to have breakfast here. As I walked in there were lines and I waited for 10 mins for a table. It was like a diner and the place is small but housefull which is a good sign. 

I ordered their Jamms Signature Omelet~

Sliced steak with mushrooms, onions, and cheese topped with their homemade béarnaise sauce $10.29

And also got their Chicken And Waffles to go.

I was expecting Fried chicken but it was crispy chicken fingers on a Belgian waffle served with syrup and whipped butter $10.59. When I opened the box, just a couple of chicken tenders on top of waffle. My bf says it looks sad LOL!

I was excited to come here since I had it bookmarked but the food was just ok. The pot of bread, which made them famous was nothing special, not a lot of flavor. 

The waitress Shirley was attentive and fast.This is the second time we visited this restaurant and nothing has improved. My previous visit was several months ago. The servers there walk around like they just lost their love ones! They all look so sad and lack of energy, I have not seen the slightest smile on their faces. When I pay at the cashier he never even looked at me and at the end he had to force himself to utter the words "thank you". Food is not the best either, beef and broccoli looked uninviting and stale. Fish slices on sushi were extremely thin, they must have really sharp knifes. Texture of the fish indicates they are not very fresh. 

It is all you can eat therefore you can aim for quantity but definitely not quality. No wow factors for any of the dishes and keep in mind that they don't seem to care whether you enjoy your dinner or not, they never asked during my two visits.So I was in Vegas on business and my client took me to eat here (at the Vegas location).  It was awesome!  When I got back to AZ i Googled them to find a location close to me.  Well there are none that are really close to me, but I went out of my way to eat here and show this place to my wife.  For some reason it was not as good as the location in Vegas but it was still very good. Whenever I am in their neck of the woods I will hit it up.Horrible restaurant. Smells yucky as soon as you get in. Manager guy catches an attitude with customers. We went there and he was asking how many we were. We said roughly 15. And he said if there is more than 15 he will charge extra $50?
Excuse me? What's going on with your restaurant ? We will never come here againThe food was so good, the meat was melting in my mouth.!!! I recommend this place to everyoneI had written a previous review when this restaurant first opened and it was great. Last night I took my sister that was visiting in town and i was excited to go back. The menu did change alot. I wish they had more apps to choose from. 

Anyways we ordered our drinks, a soda and a beer. We ordered our food when the drinks came. We ordered 2 sandwiches to split. Also we ordered ranch with our meals as well. We recieved our meals and the runner just dropped them off and ran. We had no silverware, empty drinks the whole meal and had to wait for our server for a good 7 minutes to ask for our ranvh and silverware. Still he didn't refill our drinks and we wanted to order speciality drinks. It's las vegas on a Saturday night, we really wanted to drink. Right when we brought the silverware he slapped the check into the table. No more drinks and i guess dessert was out of the question. I'm just a stickler for service and our waiter was just horrible, very impersonal and in a huge rush. I get it it's saturday night but i saw the table next to us get up to leave and they literally were right next to their chairs before he went to clear the table...give the people a minute to leave. 

Overall i wont be back again. This time the food was cold and not worth the price. The steak sandwich was good but the mac and cheese burger had no flavor and was cold because we had to wait so long for silverware and such. It would if been nice to have more drinks and dessert but the server made it pretty clear he wanted us to leave so he could have another table.We dropped by here for a late Sunday lunch. First of all, endless mimosas?? Sweeeeet. My friend downed 8 of those, so I'm pretty sure that alone made up for the buffet price haha. Heavy drinker, woot woot!

Love the setup. Very spacious and crisp\/clean feel, with chandeliers made of wine glasses and walls lined with glassware. The food was spot on for your typical Vegas buffet. Lots of choices, ranging from Chinese food and pizza to crab legs and prime rib. The dessert selection was awesome. Crepes, shaved ice, gelato, pastries galore.

We left stuffed and content. Happy I got to try this one out, since we usually hit up Bellagio or Wynn. 

One gripe was the wait list process. We had to wait 1.5 hours just to grab a late lunch and when we finally got our text to "come on down," it was to come on down and stand in another line for about 30 min to get to the cashier, pay, and wait some more for a table to actually open up. Really?? I guess it didn't help that we were all hangry :PWhile on a long weekend in Montreal, came here for drinks and lite appetizers on the recommendation of our hotel concierge.  I had a Caparina and my wife tried a few different Martinis.  Enjoyed all of the drinks.

We also tried the Venison Tartar.  Although not a fan of raw food, I've got to say the dish with the truffle oil was a great light dish.

Coming in around 4:30 on a Friday afternoon, I've got to say that the bar tending staff could have been a bit more attentive.  But moving beyond that, the atmosphere was just right for our first afternoon in Montreal.This is the worst..All Popeyes makes me sick..last time I got chicken tenders. It tasted bad..not real chicken..I just went to get the biscuits and apple pie..the place looked dirty. The guy told me pies will take 7 mins...the biscuits were hard and pop machine empty..please bring back Wendys...The menu is something special.  It changes seasonally, so be what is on the site may not always be what you will get.  The food is incredibly innovative and well done with extreme flavors and presentation.  I liked it so much I booked it again for when I come back next month.I'm a fan of the wraps they offer here. The wrap itself has a nice toasty texture and it's sturdy to hold all the lovely meat and veggies fillings. 
I get everything like those tiny picked beets and regular pickles. 

Best is the service thought. I think it's owned by a couple and they are the friendliest people!! 

Definitely a solid spotThe staff is always friendly and they get the orders up fast. The prices are good the dollar burgers and fries are very good.Went out with a friend for one or five beers and found this place one Yelp ... 1. It was close to home, 2. They had good beers on tap, and 3. We've never been. This was a Wednesday (Hump Day as I have recently found it the day is also called, thanks to some Camel ... Mike, Mike, Mike!) so the place wasn't too packed. Penguins were playing and some baseball game with Royals and Mets or somebody ...

Found out it was Taco Wednesday ... it is Wing Tuesdays at this joint. Tacos were 2 bucks a piece and not too big. I ate three and needed more so I got some wings. I honestly believe the tacos should be a buck a piece. The beers were good and they had a good selection. Had a good fall beer from Anderson Valley and a black IPA from Southern Tier, also tasty.
I had read on some reviews something about smoke inside, which I didn't witness. Maybe it being a Wednesday and not a weekend makes a difference. I saw all smokers go outside though.

All in all this is a good place to go for a good beer, and it is close enough to home that walking could be an option, though long enough that I would be sober by the time I got home! Second thought .. it is close enough to get the wife to drive over and get my drunk behind!ATTENTION  U of T students who had over 600 chicken shwarma's and sandwiches from this place, unfortunately you would not know this as this was a catered ever\t for Labour Day Orientation Day.  I witnessed your order in the making with over 500 of t\hem wrapped in foil and sitting on the counter for delivery the next day....  When mentioned that this is not the proper holding temperature for chicken they looked at me sideways, and kept on making them...  I hope no one gets sick as this is the source....Just had Dinner at Mijana and it was delicious as always. The staff was very accommodating as always and I always enjoy the atmosphere.The food was outstanding with lots of gluten
free options. Everything was so fresh and even the smaller serving was huge! We had enough left over for take out for tomorrow! They forgot my sauce but brought it immediately. We made a mistake in ordering and they fixed it with no questions. Outstanding service, a greàt experience. We will be going back.Immediately walking into Rise & Shine we were greeted by the smell of cinnamon...the interior is delightful, and the staff is amazing!  This is mine and my husband's second time here..we brought his brother to show off the abundance of food served and the delectible flavors!  Our server April was genuinely nice and friendly.  I ordered the short stack which I didn't finish because it was more like a full stack!  They were all very attentive, never had an empty glass.  By far the nicest staff and the most delicious food!  My husband and I plan to make this place a ritual in our weekly outings!Absolutely amazing service!

Pork Belly - this appetizer is a must try, the five spice really makes the dish 

Spaghetti O's - ok I know this is an odd thing to order when you are at a nice restaurant, but what can I say? I love pasta! Plus I am pregnant! These were amazing, the pasta was cooked perfectly and the ragu was scrumptious

The only downside was dessert, my friend and I both ordered the ice cream bon bons and were sorely disappointed. Not only did they arrive at our table half melted, they were ridiculously overpriced for such a small bite.Goodbye red lobster....HELLO BOILER 65!!!! Now that's what i I call seafood. My husband and I came here to celebrate his birthday and we shared a bag of shrimp, crab legs, and lobster tail with lemon peppa sauce. We couldn't decide which butter, so we got OG butter sauce on the side....it was delicious!!! More than enough food to share. The vibe of this place was real intimate with the high booths and gloves\/bin they offer, I had all the confidence to smasshhh!!!! Bomdiggity fries were the bimbdiggity, I loved the spice! Will def be coming back here again.Stopped here a few weeks ago. It was pretty late, maybe 7 or 7:30 not sure. Anyway, they were out of the bread that I wanted. I think I just got the regular bread. Other than that minor inconvenience, this place was great. I loved my sub and I saved half of it for lunch the next day and it was just as good. I would definitely return. The seating area was clean, the staff was friendly, and the price was reasonable. A favorite for sure.So tonight was the first time trying to eat here. Trying being the key word. Got in line. Ordered 1 beef taco and one beef enchilada and sat down with our party. The guys in our party that came after us and ordered some time after us got their food before me. I saw at least 15 people get their food before my friend and myself (we ordered at the same time 2 different orders). So I went up and asked for a refund.  They looked at my recipe and said oh yours is coming up soon. So I said soon was 20 people ago. I want a refund.  well my friend was still waiting on his food, his order was before mine.... He waited another 3-4 minutes before his food came.This was hands down one of the best meals of my life.. So far. Foie Gras and Steak Tartar were amazing. Raspberry dessert sphere for dessert. A sampler of tarts from the host.. Really just superb. Cucumber martini as well, perfectly made.

At first it would seem like the portions are small but really does fill you up just right. In terms of a review.. You simply MUST try this restaurant.

The host was a bit.. off-putting and we almost left. Thank goodness we didn't because we would have missed out on this amazing meal. SO GOOD. I couldn't even deduct a star for her. 

Will make more time to have sampling of all the foods next time !!Went for Christmas dinner. Waitress was friendly (which was a change from most people in Montreal) and the food was good. Lamb was delicious.Spicy pork tacos were out of this world. Very authentic! Super packed but so worth it. Grabbing a few more of these before I head homeAshley I. is THE best waitress! So glad she came over from the Elliott location by McQueen  Park, after it closed down. Always has great recommendations. Always makes sure you're having a fun time. The staff makes sure you get the game you want, anytime you ask, even for Canadian Hockey Leagues. :) P.S. Try the dessert nachos!!!!!!The sushi was awesome! Very different than I ever tasted. I ordered kimchee chigae and it absolutely nice. Lunch portion it's look like a small bowl but actually it quite filling with all the side dish. I would love to go back!Best wings I've come across! Lemon pepper wings never fail to satisfy my taste buds  and the fries have a special taste I can't get over!Fantastic food.  Excellent pizzas & burgers.

Awesome drinks.

Overall - we really like this place.

My only complaint -- the service is slow.  The last time we were there, we told our server that we needed to leave for a play.  He proceeded to walk off, take orders at a few other tables, go into the kitchen and then walk up to the front door to talk to some of the other servers.  Meh.Went here for a quick date night because I had to be up early and my man had go on the road for work. I had managed to get off somewhat early for work and we were both jonesing for a good burger....so off to Grind we went. 

Kim was our server and she was so awesome. She remembered us from before (I think its always a nice touch when someone from the staff remembers you in a good way). We ordered our usual fare (2 juicy Lucy burgers, shoestring onions, bacon, pickles, tomato, roasted garlic mayo, cayenne pepper ranch, shoestring fries, a vanilla milkshake and Newcastle Nut Brown Ale.

That was just what the doctor ordered. It was perfectly cooked, juicy and flavorful. The only thing I needed was a bigger stomach to hold more food. My man and I needed some time together and Grind (and Kim) totally made it wonderful. Will be back soon...probably after convention season slows down.Find this place by mistake but I love it  I think this is my best place for  good treat mexican bread is delicious! !keep it up your hard work.Tired Novanta for the first time and will be back.  The door was warm and inviting.  The wood decor and open kitchen was very nice.  We started off with the Antipasto Plate and then Pizzas.  Everything was fresh and delicious.This was the best hole-in-the-wall sushi place. The owners were very nice and greeted me instantly. Also, it was the best tasting sushi. I will definitely continue going back to get my fill!This is my first time at Turtle Jacks Richmond Hill and I was very disappointed with the service provided. We came in at a very slow time (2:30ish) and we had to get up and FIND our server in the restaurant every time we needed something. We ordered the Salmon Burger which was very good and the Avocado Chicken Tacos which we had to send back because the tortillas were too hard to eat! Overall, the main issue was the service definitely was not the experience I expected.Anniversary dinner to remember! Made a rez online. Started with the appy boat. Had the short rib and the butterfish. Incredible! Topped off by an incredible chocolate lava cake.  Even gave us a memento photo. Nice touch. First class night and dinner.Genius for Cosmopolitan to have a Pizza joint open after clubbing hour!  I don't want to go to an overpriced café out of desperation and pay $20 for a LOWER THAN Denny's quality meals anymore!  Just under $5 you can get a delicious slice of NY pizza just enough to coat the stomach after a night of drinking.

I went on a Wednesday night after an event at Marquee so there was no line, but I wonder how long the wait is on a busy night!Cheap, Filling and reasonably healthy. A welcome change to the deep fried gluttonous offerings mostly found in the strip vicinity. 

Its a good place to pop in for fast healthy food and a Cerveza Pacífico Clara. A very filling bean burrito with a myriad of toppings, including guacamole is under $10 and cannot possibly be finished (by me anyways). 

Bonus Star for Chipotle's commitment to organics, sustainable farming and environmental concerns. They also handed me my burrito in one wrap and basket, without additional packaging (like the Earl of Sandwich's plastic-in-plastic-in-plastic-bag-horrer)

Lots of Tabasco sauce variety for you to sprinkle on to taste.

Excellent choice for a quick bite when strip-locked.Visited last night for the first time.  Wife and son liked it, I thought it was OK.  I deducted a star for lack or alcohol service.  I was really in the mood for a cold beer and ribs and Joe's doesn't serve any alcohol of any kind.  Food was excellent quality, but the sauce was rather bland.  There is a sauce bar where you can get some extra sauce with a little kick to it.

It's a family place in the southeast valley which probably explains the "no alcohol policy" and bland preparation.  But, it's a nice place with good food if you don't mind iced tea with your ribs.You can't go wrong with this place. Definitely worth the wait. I wish there were more locations around the city. :)My family took me here for my birthday this weekend since this has always been one of my favorite places. What a disappointment! First of all, our server was the worst we all remember having at any fine dining experience, ever. We finally had to get his attention to get him to take our order. Any questions we had, he had to go ask even down to the alcohol they had. We all would have loved coffee with dessert but he never asked and we ordered off the restaurant week menu so it all came out in courses with someone else serving them so we didn't "bother" him. Now about the food... it is restaurant week, but you still expect the food to be the same high quality. My husband and son-in-law said their steaks were "good" but we can make a great steak at home. Just a steak... no garnish-didn't even look pretty on the plate. I ordered the scallops and they were over cooked and rubbery. Got 3 on the plate for $44 -only ate 1 1\/2. The risotto had a sour taste that was off putting so I didn't eat it either. My daughter had the halibut and it was very bland and under seasoned. The desserts were the highlight of the evening. The chocolate peanut butter cake and cheesecake are both amazing desserts! Our server, once again never asked if our food was ok or if we enjoyed our meal or we would have told him. In fact, no one at the restaurant did. I believe it's the first time my husband hasn't tipped over 20% at a restaurant in a very long time. At the end, our server kinda dropped a card (halfway in front of me) which was a birthday card with an offer for a free app next time...
Sorry... with so many great places in Scottsdale, pretty sure there won't be a next time.Hubby and I wanted to eat without spending a fortune. Not that easy to do in Las Vegas these days. Roys has a great HH, they call Aloha Hour. $6 for about 6 different appetizer choices. We tried 4 of them: beef sliders with sweet potato fries - delish!, Mahi mahi taco - so, so (really could have used some additional sauce, meat was pretty tasteless), Lobster potsticker - really really good, great sauce! and the BEST EVER - Tempura crusted Ahi roll. Seriously this thing is sinfully good!!
We had the 1988 cocktail and the Mai Tai, both great cocktails. This place was definitely worth the price with great service and a really luxe atmosphere. I can't wait to go back!8 people, 15 rolls of sushi, 8 plates of appetizers and 40 bombs of Sake and Sapporo.  Good service, good food and good pricing.
The atmosphere is young, loud and lively.  
I'd recommend for a big group.Horrible!  I came here at 10pm was told the kitchen was closed so I couldn't get my free meal hat was offered on my birthday coupon. Ok fine. However, servers were still taking orders and serving food. We went to the bar and sat down. A server named Elizabeth decided to serve everyone around me, even patron that walked up after. She looked right in our faces & chose to serve a patron that just walked up. I went down to the other end, and the manager had to tell someone to serve us. Really? After 15 minutes? The bar area was not that crowded. Overall, I will not be returning here. We left to go find a place that was willing to serve us food and drinks. There's no way I will spend another dime in this place. Horrible service!!!The Porkster Burger at Rehab Burger Therapy is a monstrous creation. Featuring a beef patty and a healthy serving of BBQ pulled pork that is then placed between a pretzel bun and topped with cheese. The pretzel bun is the perfect platform to savor the flavor of meat. Unfortunately, the burger I enjoyed was more of a pork sandwich than a burger, and the BBQ sauce was just a little bit too peppery (making me miss out on the all the flavors of the beef). The beef was very flavorful and the bun was perfectly moist and tender. If the BBQ and pork were toned down just a bit the burger would be in elite territory.The food was good but overpriced for what you get. The service was not good either. We sat at a dirty table. When the waitress came to take our order we asked if she could clean the table. She looked confused and told us she taught it was our mess. I showed her the last party's check was still there and she still looked dazed. Not sure what was wrong with the waitress. Maybe it was supposed to be part of the theme.I've been coming to He He Long for years now.  I do all my grocery shopping at the supermarket next door and always pop by here to get my Chinese BBQ fix.

Pros:
Some of the best BBQ pork in town
friendly staff

Cons:
Prices are high compared to other Chinese BBQ places

As I said, I do most of my grocery shopping next door so I'm here on average about once a week.  He He Long has some of the best BBQ pork in the city.  As always, if you know what you're doing, you always ask for half and half. It's always very good every time I get some.  I'm also a fan of the steamed free range chicken.  The roast pork and BBQ duck are also above average.  I recommend though as i do to all my friends, try the BBQ pork, you won't regret it.

The staff here are very friendly.  They're English isn't the best but they try their best even if you don't speak Chinese.  As a regular, they know me and always strike up conversation with me.  The lady at the front is very polite.  

There is only one thing that keeps this place from being 5 star for me, price.  They charge $9.50 a pound for BBQ pork.  That is by far the most expensive I've also seen in the city.  Don't get me wrong, it is worth every cent, but it's very pricey compared to other Chinese BBQ places.  They have a monopoly here because there's no other Chinese BBQ place even remotely near by.  Still, like I said, it's worth every cent.  Just wish it didn't hit my wallet so hard every time.

If you live in the Finch and Leslie area or anywhere near by, this is the place to go to get your Chinese BBQ fix.  Try the BBQ pork, you won't be disappointed.  Oh yes, like most Chinese establishments, bring cash.  They do not accept any other form of payment.We ate here tonight and it was not good! We ordered the mahi tacos and mahi entree. The fish had a fishy taste and was very dry.
The sides didn't have any flavor. To top it off, the service was very slow and some things didn't come at all. It took 15 minutes to get the check. I hope things improve but I can't recommend this place.3.5 stars

After having lunch at Joe's and pretty much ordered similar steak, I liked the filet at Joe's much better.  Wine by the glasses are decent but once again, I had good wines by the glass at Joe's as well.

Ordered:
1. Heirloom tomatoes with burrata - I enjoyed this salad
2. 10 oz Natural Prime Filet - decent but not the best steak or even one of the top steaks
3. Potato puree - okay
4.Tom Collin's - it was refreshing but too bitter for me

I sat at the bar area and my server was good.  I was happy with the service.I've had a good experience here. The sushi was delicious, too bad my stomach couldn't hold any more than I had already consumed.

The wait staff was good, served us in a timely manner. I recommend this place for sure.The night staff is super friendly. My co-workers and I enjoy going after work. The breakfast is pretty average and so are the prices. The chicken fingers are average as well. The day staff is a little grumpy but It is our night time in the morning. There are several bars to choose from and this one is not on the top of the list.I typically like Coldstone, but the service was not friendly and the Ice Cream didn't seam to be as creamy as it normally is.Great dinner and outstanding service. 

We arrived at Sensi without a reservation because we had a change of heart in type of food we wanted. Our anniversary was coming up, and we let them know at the front. 

We got a table quickly (for 2 at 9 pm on a Thursday night).  They were busy but the service was great. From complimentary glasses of champagne for our anniversary to great recommendations on food. 

We had the the seafood platter which was good size (not cheap but worth it). 

We had the fish special - an excellent glazed tuna. We also had the crispy shrimp as a main. Both were delicious. Too full for dessert but a great experience and the staff treated us like gold.Don't eat the mussels next to the cold crab legs.  I got food poisoning.  The hot crab legs on Fridays are hit or miss.  Sometimes they're really meaty and juicy and other times they're small and not tasteful.their happy hour deal with burger and a beer is awesome! one of the best tasting and juicy buergers I've ever had and great price. All my firends in my group agreed! Also, nice atmosphere, classy. You just have to get there in time to find a place at the bar area to get happy hour price dealsCall me a little biased because my girlfriend use to work here - but that means I actually spent a lot of time here. Honestly, the coffee is really good - especially love their cold brew (who knew cold coffee was a thing? I didn't). Service is super friendly, I remember hearing Andrew singing in there one day when pretty much everybody was gone - smiles all around :) Seriously, the people make this place, and it's THE cafe you should visit while in the area!

Oh yeh, the breakfast naps are awesome - worth the $!Your classic and high quality steakhouse. You can't go wrong. 

Wine list is exceptional. Steak menu with both dry aged and wet aged steaks. Surf and turf galore. Appetizers range from huge jumbo shrimp cocktail, coq st. jacques, smoked salmon or escargot. 

They've been doing this for a long time, over 50 years, and they know how to have their steaks cut, griled to perfection, and served for satisfaction.

Yes you do pay for the quality, but you get your money's worth. Very Mad Men like. The service is not offensive or snobby, the interior speaks history, tucked away on elm street in an old house, the floors squeak with a story, and there's tonnes of private areas. 

I love this place. Over HY's, Ruth's Chris, North 44, this is the place i like the most because it's the same price, with the feel of authenticity, of family specialty, and not of invested corporate money in fancy atmosphere's.I love this place. Anytime we are in Toronto we come here at least a few times over the length of our stay. The food quality, freshness and quantity is great. We always have enough left over for another big meal. When a food business over exceeds a New Yorker's expectation it must be a great place. :)The crepes here are good. They are tasty and they have a variety. 

However, the crepes are extremely over price. So over price that I cannot afford a drink.

Finally, the staff is extremely rude and LOVES to make loud examples of people not familiar with their system. I've chosen never to eat here again due to the staff.I have been here a handful of times hoping it would get better, but it doesn't.
 
A few months ago I ordered a buckwheat pancake to have with the rest of my meal. It tasted rancid. I asked if they could make a fresh batch which they brought about 10 minutes later. It tasted identical to the other one. Thankfully I didn't get to pay for it as I couldn't eat it. I suggested they check their buckwheat flour before making another order for someone else.

Another few times the service is quite lacking. The restaurant is 1\/4 full, yet getting your order taken only 15 minutes later.

Speaking of being empty: I tried to go for a late lunch with my husband for 2PM on a Tuesday. We get there and they say they are closing and not accepting more customers. They are supposed to close for 4PM. VERY frustrating!!!

I won't be back.It was a bit of a wait, but the food was good. I like the fact that they have a variety of options to choose from.

Unfortunately, the young blonde girl behind the to-go counter was quite rude to me after I had to double back and pick up the things they left out of my order. No regard to the inconvenience of the customer, not even an apology. Left a bad taste in my mouth, for sureFan Boy Fries are the best :] i love themI drive by this place all the time because it's on my way to Costco and on one of my alternate routes to\/from work.  I often wondered about some of the places along my way on Old Pineville Rd like McCoy's.   After reading some of the other reviews on Yelp and also getting a flyer on my door at home, I decided it was definitely time to check it out.

McCoy's is a relatively small place but they make use of every inch of space with plenty of tables even if they might be a little close together.  There is also a bar with about 10-12 seats, TVs scattered around and a few video games back in the corner.  They also have a covered patio out front for additional seating.

There is a very extensive menu for such a small place - everything from sandwiches, salads, to steaks, ribs and barbecue.

I ordered the pork barbecue plate with collards and suateed mushrooms.  In about 10 minutes the meal was out.  The pork stands on its own which is hard to find at a barbecue place in Charlotte.  You don't need any sauce on McCoy's pork 'cue.  It's very moist, tender and flavorful and probably the best barbecue I've had in Charlotte for a long time.  Yes, It's better than Mac's IMO...and cheaper.   I will say that I tried both the sauces, an eastern NC and a western NC style sauce and I wasn't really impressed with either of them  which is fine because like I said, the meat is fine by itself.  Who needs sauce!

For sides, the mushrooms were great and the collards were good also.  They came with a homemade pepper vinegar rather than the standard Texas Pete stuff which was a nice touch!  

Service-wise is where I think they can improve on.  The hostess didn't really greet me.  She just showed up when I entered the place and sat me at a table without really saying anything.  My server kind of started out the same way but got better as I sat there and did come to check up on me and refill my drink.

Overall, McCoy's is great and I think I just found my new favorite BBQ joint in Charlotte.Eh. 
Huge lines at lunch time. 

Alright pizza. Expensive for what you get just like all of Vegas.Talk about the best steak ever. The cocktails are to die for and oh my goodness the desserts are orgasmic!We have been loyal customers to Daily Dose simply because we've never had bad service or food! We sat at the bar and had excellent customer service!Super super cute place! It's a home that's been converted to a restaurant. Food is absolutely delicious and homemade. I felt at home coming in here. Great place.Given the reviews, I may have just had a bad experience. I love Mexican food and was less than impressed with this place. I sat at the bar and had three different bartenders involved in my service which seemed to make the service worse, rather than better as it seemed unclear (to all) who was taking care of me. My margarita was solid but not excellent. The guacamole was decent and the chips were above average but the presentation of the guacamole was lacking- like it had been slapped onto a side plate. All three salsas were excellent. My chicken poblano enchiladas were disappointing. The biggest issue was temperature as they were barely luke warm. The flavor was ok but not enough to make up for the near absence of cheese (apparently my favorite part of an enchilada). The side of plantains were excellent. So overall, this was definitely a mixed bag and given the price, not ultimately worth the visit.The worst sushi I have everrrrr had. I typically always bring leftovers for lunch but didn't have any so I decided I would go buy lunch. Stopped here to get sushi and was highly disappointed. The girl behind the counter was far from polite. I asked for a side of the pineapple fried rice. She said they don't do that. They only do regular fried rice, so I said ok and just got the "meal". Turns out it's literally fried rice with a couple chunks of pineapple... so why couldn't you just ask them to throw the pineapple in there for a side? My lord. As for the sushi I got the Philadelphia roll and spicy tuna. The philly roll was sooo overwhelming gross I literally spit it out. The spicy tuna was so full of the tempura crunch that a hard chunk of it was all I crunched down on through every bite. The menu didn't state it had the tempura in it so I assumed it was just spicy tuna and nothing more. Disgusting. Absolutely will never return. I'll make larger portions for dinner from now on so I'm not stuck eating at a place like this again.The scenery here was super cute and the rolls were perfect. The staff was very nice and my experience was overall great. I'll be back :)2 star may be a bit generous but the food was eatable.... service SUCKED.... and our waitresses had to make it a point to tell that she was still busy do her manager duties from this morning..... Why do we care?? We just wanted a decent lunch, not to here how important our waitresses was.... 
They weren't  super busy and most of the staff was just standing around talking to each other, so much so that I watched two other tables have to get up and go find their server .... twice!!!!
Our food took forever and wasn't great, had the fajitas and the chicken was dry and flavorless and the steak was tuff and WAY over cooked. Food was dropped off at our table with no tortillas and missing all the side that were supposed to go with it..... there was only 4 of us so it wasn't a huge order or anything. Or waitresses went to get tortillas and sides and was gone so long that our food started to get pretty cold..... got my iced tea refilled for the first time as we got the check.....

This was one of the few times I went to eat someplace and didn't check Yelp first.... won't make that mistake again..... our experience seems to mirror the other bad experiences people have posted about.... they have less than 3 stars for a good reason.... 

Crummy food
Crappy service 
And staff that appears to careless....

My opinion skip this place and go somewhere that has 3 or more stars on yelpRecently opened and running along swimmingly. The menu changes frequently, so keep an open mind about what you might order. 
The Tarte Flambee comes in a variety of flavours- and this is a fantastic vegetarian option, or a sharable appetizer for after-work drinkers. 
The other mains range from Alsatian (semi-German) sausages and spatzle to gazpacho to beef tongue. 
For adventurous eaters and picky eaters- there is something for everyone. 
Cool list of cocktails with mint, ginger, basil etc...
Good for groups and outdoor patio seating.The service is slow but I think that's the trend in the south.  So you'll spend at least an hour eating the different portions. The food however is really good.  The grits were amazing and the deviled eggs were spectacular. The chicken and waffle was great and moist and the gravy on the chicken and biscuit was interestingly delicious. I would come here again just for the grits.I've eaten here before when it was The Good Egg but am LOVING the First Watch changes. The manager came over to greet me personally and my server (Desmond) was polite, knowledgeable of the new menu and offered an excellent suggestion to my normal favorite. I tried the healthy egg white omelette w\/spinach, feta cheese and sliWhy not five, I argue with myself as I write this review. I am, after all, a new card carrying monk. The highlight of my day today will likely be the sublimely self-righteous ale that is waiting for me.... 
I guess Papago seems to be a little exclusive, which initially I didn't like. Not feeling comfortable bringing my non-beer aficionado friends into a place made me reluctant to embrace, even appreciate it. Fast forward a year and I now get it. No, I'm not going to bring my bud swilling friends here, nor do I care if they decide they would rather go to ____ sports bar, or Club ____. Then there's the service. Spotty at times, but I have found that being in a hurry, well it's kind of counter productive when trying to relax and enjoy some of the finest free flowing alcohol this planet has to offer. 
Those are my complaints, now that I see I have no real issues with this place, I can give it an honest 5 stars. Rather than list everything I love about this place, I encourage you to get a DD, hop on your bike or take a cab on down to the Papago, belly up to the bar, grab the beer list (or consult the usually very helpful bar tenders) and prepare yourself for some good food, and even better brews.I have had Indian food before and this place is about average with the rest. The place was kind of dirty and dark. The food was average at best and prob would go somewhere else first next time.This place gets one star for the Sangria which was pretty good. As far as the food goes it was terrible. Does the cooks in the back not know what salt and pepper is? None of the food had any flavor. It was like upscale hospital food. The two shrimp dishes we ordered had the smallest shrimp I had ever seen. Popeyes has bigger popcorn shrimp. To make things worse none of the food was cheap. We ended up spending $100+ after tip for the worst meal I had ever had. I should of listened to my gf and took her to Cheesecake Factory. It may be a chain but its a 100 times better than Tusca. They need to send a representative from Tusca to a real Tapas restaurant to take some notes. It seems like some idiot chef created all of their crappy dishes. This place needs to call the FOX network to have Chef Ramsey come in and turn it around.I stayed here between Christmas and New Years.  Having booked my stay a few months in advance I got a really great rate.  They were taking walk ins at over twice what I paid.  This was the first time I had stayed off the strip in over 20 years.

The cons:
I am a smoker and was surprised the smoke smell affected me the first time I walked in.
The room I was in showed a lot of wear and the carpets were stained.

The pros:
The room was quite spacious, the chairs comfortable, as was the bed.  Every employee I dealt with was pleasant and helpful.

There was a good selection of eating places, I did not get to try them all.  I was unimpressed with the ability to watch whatever I wanted at the sports book but after wandering around I was able to find a bar with any game I was interested in.  This is definitely a place that caters to the locals and I spent several hours at the bars watching games and chatting with them.  Definitely a different feel than staying on the strip.  The two afternoons I went off to the strip the shuttle proved to be very handy.  I went up to the bowling alley and wished I had a ball with me, it was a nice looking facility.  Beers are less expensive than on the strip by a bunch.

Overall this is a place I will most likely stay at again.Loved it here! A big fan of the show and came to Las Vegas from Houston to try it out. I ordered from the 3 course lunch menu. My scallops were a little over cooked but the flavor made up for it by a long shot. I also added the lobster risotto because I had to try it and loved it! Beef Wellington was tasty and cooked to perfection! The dessert (sticky top pudding) was probably the best thing! Perfectly sweet and so tasty! Gordon Ramsay knows his food! My waiter was also amazing! I believe his name was garvin! He new everything about the menu and answered every question we had! Will be returning!I don't know about the other menu options but the jalapeno chicken was horrible. The chicken pieces weren't even browned. The sauce sucked. I ended up eating steamed rice and soy sauce for dinner.Always friendly service. I used to like their burgers when I ate meat, but now I just order their fries animal-style. Yum. I heard their grilled cheese is good tooI don't write reviews much, although I should - because this place deserves a great review. 

We've been in the valley a few years, tried many places, NONE of them as good as this one. 

Great food, great service, fast delivery - some of the best crab rangoon you'll ever try. 

Good NYC style Chinese.the only thing that's even halfway decent here is breakfast. 

don't order dinner here unless you have self respect issues.

they have good toast.

sad that this is all i have to say, isn't it?  that's really how i feel.This morning woke up an wanted a hearty breakfast, for me that means black bear diner, great food big portions, I had the Joe bear scramble( eggs, season ground beef , spinach , sausage, onions and topped w\/ cheese piled on diced red potato, I don't know y I do this but I had to try the cinnamon French toast.  They get two cinnamon rolls split it , egg wash it put it on griddle , very good jus takes a little syrup already sweet . Service was on point, even though it was very busy. I don't know how they can b so consistent even when they r getting slammed.The food was less than mediocre, the burgers were dry, the lobster roll was bland.. The only good thing was the staffGood flavors and food truck in a store feeling. Tried for the first time and despite some glitches in the ordering process (still working out the menu and ordering kinks) they were very prompt to solve them. Have had mexican many times before, but this has been definitely one of the tastier so far. Tried the shrimp tacos, cod tacos and quesadilla. All very tasty.Yo yo this place will knock ya damn feet off .. I ordered every dog on the menu it was so bomb. My girl was deep throating so many dogs I was impressed !!My favorite place to get the most delicious hummus bowl.  I try to visit this place at least once a week for lunch and I love it!  Thanks for always accepting my Yelp check in for a free iced tea. Ice tea is made fresh and is superb!I've been to Eleven twice. This is definitely one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh. If you want some awesome Modern American food, Eleven will never let you down. 

I went here with two of my best friends for Sunday brunch. We had three different appetizers, including oysters, salmon, and a cheese platter. All the food is prepared beautifully. My entree is steak and egg. The fried egg is my favorite part of the dish. Steak is juicy and absolutely delicious.

The ambience in the restaurant is also great. Definitely a great place to go to for special occasion or simply for quality time with good friends :-)We were treated with one of the nicest staff I had ever met. A younger guy but I can't remember his name. I do remember the staff there overall being super friendly and nice enough to smile at pretty much all times. Chubby Cattle is extremely welcoming and has really fast service. Sadly my concerns are definitely with some of the food. The spicy soup base had way too much peppers or chili-the floating ingredients already in the base. It was quite the hassle when with a mild spicy dish, I had spent a long time fishing so much of it out of the soup. The inconvenience affected how much time I spent actually eating and boiling noodles and meat in the broth. I'd hate to say it but this negatively impacted my overall experience. The meat, if you get the lamb, comes in such thin slices that it near dissolved overtime on the place and worse was not something I thoroughly enjoyed after cooking in the broth. I think that a better combination of food would have made for a better time, so this understanding and the thoughtful\/quick service is what saves my thoughts on the Chubby Cattle.I just love Boralia so much. I've been here 4-5 times and of it is the one restaurant I consistently recommend to friends and out-of-towners. The food is unique and delicious. I recommend the foie gras - it is SOOOOO GOOD. They will give you extra crisps if you run out. The grilled mushroom salad and pigeon pie are also a must.  Alternatively you can do the $60 pp sharing option, which allows you to sit back and relax as they feed you :)Great food especially for such a large menu! Amy is the best! You cant go wrong eating here. The wings are the bomb and so is the ahi soba noodles, jambalaya ....the list goes on! Sit at the bar because Amy will make sure you have the best visit ever! Love ya girl!I love the chicken ponzu and the mini udon here. It's a very small place but usually no wait. The green tea waffle is amazing to finish the meal.Was visiting family over the Labor
day weekend and we came here to have dinner. Why only one star? Our server\/waiter was very unorganized. He wasn't collecting our plates soon enough, and they started to pile up. We order our drinks when we got sat down at our table and he forgot 3 drinks. He brought the check 20 minutes after we got there, at that point we felt like he wanted us to leave. Sorry but I am not going back ever!!!I'll take Li'l Porgy's over factory BBQ any day of the week. And I'll certainly take it over some schmengy As Seen On TV sandwich shop, that's for sure. Not that I'm drinking the chain haterade, but this place has personality just oozing out of every crack and crevice, much like the smoke that fills the air each day.

The Yelp app led me here, and I ordered a brisket sandwich with a few sides (slaw and beans) and of course they include that crisp pickle spear in the order. Yessir.

So let's begin with the order itself. You walk in, and immediately it's a wave of smoke and fry scent. I smelled like Porgy's all afternoon (you're just going to need to wash your clothes later) but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Just know before you go. The nice woman at the register took my order while shouting it out to the people in the kitchen, and you slide down to the counter to pick it up. Lightning fast! That's the beauty of BBQ--all the prep is done beforehand and then you just sling it out (with love, of course) to waiting customers.

Sling they did, and I went to sit down with my food and my strawberry soda. STRAWBERRY SODA! I don't usually love it, but there's something that happened when it mixed with BBQ and I honestly don't know if I'll ever try BBQ without it again. Trust.

The food was okay--unfortunately the brisket had been holding wet (in water, maybe?) and when they put it on the light bun for the sandwich, it got soggy pretty quick. Maybe avoid the sandwich and get it as a meat plate? The sides were fine. My socks were not knocked anywhere, but I did enjoy them. Pickle win. All in all, a nice lunch from nice local folks.The reason I like this more then the other ramen place is the miso broth which has so much garlic in it! The last time I got the "thin" noodles, I found them too thin, I think the regular noodle is the best! And always pork belly! Like a thick juicy bacon lol almost but not really but it's soo good!Yummy food and cool drinks in a casual atmosphere. Crowded and full of people on a weekday, which is a good thing. Enjoyed the diverse selection of dinner items, especially the salads and drink choices. Salmon salad was tasty and so was my blueberry lemonade! Next time I visit Pittsburgh, I will dine here.Great spot and reasonably priced. I always get Garden Cucumber Martini, very refreshing! And the sangria Martini in the fall... Ultimate fall cocktail yummm! Husband favs: Aviation, last word, and boulevardier. Arancini is sooooo yummy, better than I've had anywhere... just get them trust me, I can down 4 plates in 1 sitting lol. Shortie tacos are super tender. Kyle and Elon make fantastic drinks and are super creative, so if you don't know what to get, tell them what u like and let them make u an awesome cocktail, u can thank me later ;)Get the $5 two-topping special. You will not be sorry. You have multiple choices for crusts I got the garlic and herb and it is excellent. Plenty of cheese and sauce and toppings to make it worth the $5. I called it in on the way after work and it was ready when I walked in the door. It's a no-brainer when you don't know what you're going to have for dinner. The service was excellent and the guy at the register was knowledgeable. They even give a military discount! Yay for Hungry Howie's honoring the military, that's always a huge plus in my book.Food is good but service, time and again, suffers.  We went today after not going for several months due to poor service. Well, once again, poor service abounds. It took 1 hour to get our food because of a technology issue with printing tickets in the kitchen. We asked for a discount and were told the manager had given us a 10% discount. Once we looked at our checks, we realized they only applied the discount to certain items and then it wasn't a full 10%. One couple got 60cents on a $22 bill!!  That amount was more of an insult than not giving us anything. Oh well...  Guess we'll wait a long time before going back... If ever... Multiply that times the 7 people in our party and that measly discount cost them a whole lot more. Too bad ... cause the food was pretty good.I like the health focus of Mira Mira, the food tasted like a lot of care was put into it and was very fresh. I ordered the kimchi chicken, which comes with grilled chicken loaded with kimchi sauce, and a heap of kale salad.

The chicken was grilled to perfection and super juicy. I wasn't in love with the kimchi sauce on top. Maybe I was missing the typical crunch from kimchi, or maybe a combined bite with the kale was a little unusual for my taste buds. The portion of the kale salad was huge. Its loaded with seeds and chickpea sprouts. I've never had chickpea sprouts and I think this was a good first. It added a little bit of surprise to each bite. 

Located in Assembly Chefs Hall with so many different stall options, this place would not be the first one I'd try, but worth checking out some time. The hall has lots of seating and a very lively atmosphere. The space is newly renovated and beautiful. And as a closing remark, the price is a bit ridiculous... after tax, it came out to a little over $20, assembly chefs hall mark-up :sI loved everything about our visit here! The vibes were great, the staff was friendly and VERY accommodating! We ordered two rolls from the happy hour menu, the coconut chicken curry hot pot, and one signature dish. My goodness!! The best Japanese\/Korean food I have had in a long time! I'm not even a big curry kind of person but this was to die for! The best part is they are down the street from me! I will definitely be back!Based on one review I decided to take a chance on this place. I am glad I did!
The food is great, everything was cooked perfectly. The prices are great, you can eat a great breakfast and coffee for less than $10.00.
The place is clean and the staff is very friendly.
Give this new place a try, you won't be sorry.This was the 2nd time I was at Sushi Brokers 1\/18\/17. Service was ok. The server hit every table in our section except our table. She was not very friendly. Sushi was average. I would go back due to it being less than a mile from my house.Rose Tea Cafe, I had really high hopes for you. After the mediocre (nicely putting it) service in the Squirrel Hill location, I was really hoping you'd become more people friendly so costumers would actually want to go to your restaurant.

I rarely give out one stars, but the service was so poor that I feel obligated to. When me and my friend went into Rose Tea, there was a huge clump of people at the door waiting for their food. There were also no seats available. With no clear signs stating that there was a difference between the takeout section, and the sitdown section, when the person serving asked us hurriedly if we were ready to order, we did. 

When we tried to sit down, we got yelled at by the waitress. She accused us of trying to cheat them out of tips by ordering take-out and sitting down to eat it. She also told us "not to speak Chinese" when we tried to clarify.

Excuse me? If you guys had clearly marked what costumers were supposed to do, or if the waiter had even asked if we wanted to sit down, or order out instead of expecting us to know what to do, we would've been more than happy to accommodate. 

Needless to say, this whole experience left a bitter taste in my mouth, and the greasy food couldn't chase that down either.

This restaurant is definitely entering my list of never-to-return places.Family and I enjoyed this well lit establishment. Food and services were excellent... complimentary fresh baked bread is very addicting "warning" but well prepared.. highly recommended this restaurant.. everything was perfect... definitely will be returning.If you're reading this review, I'm assuming that you're considering to, against your better judgment, try the old pizza-hut-looking Greek place with a random drive through that you pass by on the way to Pita Jungle but you're thinking "It can't be as good as Pita Jungle. I mean, it's a drive through!"  To you, I have two things to say:

1) For a place that has "Pita" in its very name. Z's kicks Pita Jungle's hippie little ass as far as delicious, pillowy, perfect little pitas go. Oh my god they are amazing, I could eat them all day.
2) The drive through is actually Z's Greek's best asset, because the inside kind of reminds me a dumpy fast food place and the drive through makes it a convenient place to pick up food that isn't the complete garbage that comes out of most drive through windows.

Actually, one of the hardest drives I ever have to make is the 2 mile drive from the end of the Z's Greek drive through to my condo.  The smell their delicious gyros infiltrates my car and makes it impossible to concentrate on anything other than GETTING THE EFF HOME TO GET THIS FOOD IN MY MOUTH. I'm an even bigger driving hazard than usual, putting my own life at risk in the name of pita, but it is totally worth it.

I usually get the Chicken Souvlaki pita, stuffed with juicy marinated chicken and a side of tangy tzaziki (I add the sriracha myself), and a small Greek salad, loaded with enough feta cheese it's probably not even a healthy choice anymore. I also LOVE their avgolemono soup when it's not 1 million degrees (though I can't pronounce it and look like an idiot when I try).  I can usually get delicious, filling dinners for me and boyfriend and get out of there for less than $20, which makes it a great, inexpensive, healthy-ish option for nights when I don't feel like getting out of a damn car, letting alone cooking an entire dinner.

So to answer your questions: Yes, you SHOULD try the questionable looking Greek place, yes, they ARE better than Pita Jungle, and yes, drive thru is always the way to go (unless they remodel their inside, which I would totally love, but I don't think it's quite made it to their business model roadmap.) Four stars!I was worried at first because there were a couple weddings going on while we were there, but they didn't interfere with anything. And, overall, the staff, restaurants, room, pool, and almost everything seemed perfect.

I did have one complaint, there didn't seem to be an exhaust fan or window in the toilet room in the bathroom. Since it's physically in the middle of the suite, it seemed odd, and I didn't even think that was possible with building codes. There seemed to be no exhaust ventilation to the toilet room at all. I asked some other guests if they had the same issue in their room, and they said yes.

Based on the bathroom issue alone, I wouldn't really pick this as the place to stay. And would avoid it if I was sharing the room with someone.

Other than that, there wasn't anything else to complain about.I go here for brunch fairly often.  The specials are really creative and delicious, sometimes combining unusual breakfast ingredients in a wonderful way.  The servers are polite and attentive.  Likewise, it can get crowded on Saturday mornings.  5 stars!I love finding new small 'family' restaurants that may have a unique sauce or dish that is different from a standard formula chain taste. Plus, I'd rather give my $ to local businesses that usually give you more for your money with great customer service to boot.

The other day  my assistant told me about "Babe's" on Lorain near W.98th-(form.Hobo Joe's)  and how their ribs were  drop off the bone delicious! and at a good price-$9 for a dinner with lots of fries and coleslaw. Couldn't wait!
Next day we phoned an order in.. My asst. told them on  the phone how good her dinner was the previous night and placed my order-1st time she'd been there too.

To be brief,  it was simply the WORST ribs I've had in my life! No sarcasm  here!  I bit into a rib and the "meat?" hit my teeth like a hard piece of fiber board! I tried  to chew it but it looked like a ball of splinters when I spit it out..I'm brave and tried another bone. the meat-(not the bone) cut the inside of my top lip-it drew blood! 

I could tell the fries were old, hardish\/mealy\/uncooked in the center and rewarmed poorly. Coleslaw was runny and too burny. The ribs and fries had freezer burn taste and past the (pretty good flavored BBQ sauce) "turf\/particle board' meat there was a layer of slimy fat!  No meat, gel-ly fat UUUHHGG!  The 'meatcut' and bleeding stopped the  "trying"

We called but "the owner left"....I do not want a free meal-MY God-NO WAY! $9 thrown to the trash, saltwater on my cut lip and gums and 24-48hrs Botulism can show up-(not yet)..I feel  rumblings tho...back to Geppetto's? DEFINITELY-After if I  can look at another rib.

I really am shocked it could be that horrible. But  it really was.  (8-(Arnold Palmers with southern-style sweet tea? Check! 
Dog treats given out in the drive-through when they see a furball in the car? Yes!
Amusing, if cheesy, welcomes to the restaurant?  Indeed!
Pleasant staff?  Yep! 
Tasty food at reasonable prices?  That too!

When I'm not feeling up to cooking, this is my go-to place for sure.This is my GO-TO sushi place. There is a nice atmosphere, and it has a really nice mix of different Asian foods (I've seen people complaining, but they have definitely always played Korean music) and I think this greatly benefits them. There is something for everyone. Their lollipop roll is my favorite fried roll, and we always have to order the salmon nigiri. It seems pricey, but it's all worth it. If you're not a fan of sushi, their noodles are delicious. I have also ordered the chicken katsu (a personal favorite). The bento boxes are a good place to start if you are completely overwhelmed (everything you can order for these I have learned are all very delicious, come with a protein, sticky rice, Asian salad, and miso soup). I would definitely recommend the yakisoba. 

All in all, I think they're a generally good restaurant. Maybe not if you're looking for strictly Japanese, but you will receive quality (so much better than Ra and many other local places) and its family owned. A nice place to relax and talk. I always leave satisfied.My sister-n-law and I ordered from here for a late lunch\/early dinner. We called to see if they did delivery and were informed that the delivery guy had left for the day already. It wasn't a huge deal because the place is so close, so I biked to pick it up. They said it would be ready to go in around 15-20 min. 

First thing that made me nervous when I got there was I didn't see a bike rack, sign, pole, anything to lock my bike to, so I had to leave it sitting right outside the store for the world to walk off with. Otherwise, the place looked nice and clean, the lady had my order ready and was polite and quick with processing my payment. 

After I got home I was excited to see the food. I had ordered Chicken Spicy Noodles  (med. spicy) with an added side of sticky rice and my sis had ordered Pad Thai Chicken.

Both main dishes looked delicious (a little sloshed due to the ride back) but delicious. The only 'ugh' thing was the side of sticky rice, it looked horrible. It was packaged in a little fold over sandwich bag and seemed very stiff. ((I'm not the best cook but the only time my sticky rice looked like that was when I had overcooked or reheated it wrong)). Once I took it out of the bag I feared the rice was a lost cause, I had to pry a chunk off just to try. Needless to say I was hoping that it tasted better but I was wrong there too. I ended up tossing it.

The flavors of the main dishes made the loss of rice bearable. My dish was extremely good and had a very delicious heat, my sis's dish was also very tasty with a nice crunch. I would say this is definitely a good place to stop if you're nearby and craving Thai. The prices were decent and I will most likely eat here again when I've got a craving and not wanting to go out; though I doubt I'll ever get the sticky rice again - better just make my own.I love this place. Here, i've shared my birthdays, hangovers, dates, heartbreaks, general celebration and merriment. I've showed up in jeans, sari, PJs, mini-skirt; and its always great fun. Ive tried most things on their menu, but tandoori wings are to die for! 

The service is sometimes not the best, if you are in a large group. So be patient and talk to your server. Also, it can get loud, because everyone is trying to talk on top of the music. You might want to sit outside if that bothers you. 

Make sure you visit the restrooms. They are great fun!I love Oriental Palace Buffet!  First off, I just have to note that half the fun is reading the labels on the food along the buffet.  One day, I may have to submit some of them to Engrish.com: "STRAWBERRY JELLOY," the jello reads, and "ORANG" to describe the fruit below.  The labels go on and on, and it's a sweet, if not baffling, touch.

That being said, I don't mean to laugh at the owner and staff's expense, because they're all very nice there.  When I get the buffet take-out (they charge by the pound), they've given me breaks on prices if I've come close to closing time.  The food is alright, and because of the range of choices you can probably find something you like and won't feel too guilty if you don't want to finish eating certain things.

The peanut chicken is my favorite, and I find it addictive.  They offer several vegetable-heavy dishes, as well as seafood and some unexpected, random things (like pizza).  I tend to stay away from the sushi and the desserts; neither appeal to me.

The facility is spacious and clean, and the staff is very attentive, clearing plates and silverware often in-between helpings.  There's a large private party room off to the side of the buffet that's a nice area to dine when people crowd the booth area.This has become my once a week splurge.  Everything I have eaten has been absolutely amazing.  My favorites:

Filet Cobb Salad
Filet steak sandwich
French dip

Burgers are amazing as well, I do need to try the steak and prime rib one day.WHAT TO TRY?!

I would come here early on a summer night and enjoy the view from the rooftop here. This place is known more so for its view of the city and the fact that you're on the rooftop. The doors open and the rooftop terrace space suddenly becomes bigger with the rooftop pool that ppl can swim in. I came right before it got too busy so we avoided lines downstairs and we got seated. 

It's generally packed in here on the winter days because the restaurant suddenly accommodates less people and a lot of ppl still want to come here for a drink or a bite. 

We came here for desserts. Unfortunately their freezer wasn't working so none of the desserts had ice cream accompanying the dessert and you can't order scoops of ice cream or sorbets. :(

I have to say despite no ice cream, the desserts we ordered tasted great. We had the chocolate molten lava cake and the tres leche cake. In comparison to the lava cake I had at Lee's, it's comparable! I actually liked the crunch I get from the edge of the cake. It would have been amazing if there was ice cream accompanying this cake, but I enjoyed it. The tres leche cake wasn't too sweet even though it had dulce de leche in here and the cake was very moist. Both desserts were delicious. 

At 9:30pm, this place was still very busy. Sometimes you want to spot some local celebrities too. I was fortunate to spot the hotels owner Charles Khabouth just walking around checking how the crowd is at the restaurant. This place was busy alright! Busy to the point there wasn't much room to stand or sit at the bar either! 

Overall, I'll come back here again to give their dinner menu a try!

LAST TIP?!

Make reservations. I can't emphasize enough about how busy this place gets and sometimes booking online is difficult. I suggest booking by calling or come one evening to make your reservation. Come check this restaurant out during the summer time when they open their full terrace and their pool and admire CN tower as your backdrop!! Also order their ice cream or sorbets because it's not your typical flavors you can try elsewhere.A really good Japanese curry restaurant. After being seated and ordering, we had to ask to get our waters. Also, the ratio of rice to curry was a little bit off for me (more rice than curry) but besides that, the currys are pretty good. I probably will be coming back, just not anytime soonHAPPY HOUR!
Walked through New York, New York looking for something to eat and we came across the Nine Fine Irishmen Pub.
We were sat right away  at a nice table tucked in the back corner.
Our waitress was AWESOME!   
This was the first time I tried Irish food.......I ordered the Shepherds Pie.
The pie is basically a beef stew with a mashed potato topping...it was soooo freaking good!  This is some of the best comfort food I have ever had.   
Plus..we can't forget HAPPY HOUR...the main reason why we came in here.
Boddington's on tap !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I was in heaven!
Great place to hang...drink...eat...watch a game!They made our birthday party perfect!
One star down because they don't offer a cake. In fact, you can't bring a cake! Cupcakes are allowed.
Pizza was good, we all had a stress free time.
Kayden loves his T-shirt they had everyone sign for him and his personalized balloon.
It wasn't crowded and all drinks are refillable. They didn't rush us and I think we went overtime. They were all around great.To day is Mothers Day , The restaurant was pretty busy  and The service was very good , I had Yelp them a few days ago . Food Looked Good in pics. 
But now you can compare my pics Now ,to ones 9 months ago . Smaller portions more money. The corn beef hash was OK needed flavor in the corn beef plus as you can see compare pictures smaller portions but was OK with me because I really didn't like it. 3 STARS FOR GOOD SERVICE
Price Too high $$$$I'm a big fan of chick fil a but this location doesn't seem to be that good. I've been here around five times so far and have already got wrong items twice.  They either forget to put the fries in your order or upgrade them to something you never ordered..and charge you for that. Glad they will refund you but it's a hassle to drive back. Have to be very careful and check the food before leaving at this location.Yelp Challenge 365 # 174\/365

On the reviews of Dave F, Michael C, Chau V and last but not least Kevin P, I decided to give this place a try. Let me preface my review by saying I am not much of a buffet person... okay, call me a buffet snob and based on my being a buffet snob, I am compelled to write a review of what I found to be

1) a new concept of buffet. Why? because each course is served in its individual dishes; portioned just right for the tasting

2) a beautiful place in a sassy hotel and casino

3) easy to get to meaning you don't have to search for it. The 2nd floor is designed such that you can simply follow the signs and you will find it.

4) reasonable in cost; the dinner buffet is $35

5) a great place to taste wines you can pair with your selections of food. You would have to purhcase a wine card for $25. Take the card to the wine chill, select your variety of wine with a 1 ounce minimum.... and you're good to go. You will be able to pair your food with the wine

And the list goes on. For the most part, if I had to do a buffet in Las Vegas, I would definitely go back to the Wicked Spoon.

By the way, my favorite course was the lobster mac n cheese, veal sliders, followed by their fresh seafood bar and then.... deserts!This stuff is way better than the 
pre-packaged 79 cent noodle packs you can find at any grocery\/convenient store. I'd recommend trying their Spicy Ramens with Pork Belly. I would definitely pass on the chili oil which leaves a bad aftertaste. This place is pretty good overall.Fck this place. Attacking Alissa and Faze banks. No one should be giving them buisness!!!! Ladies dont go here you'll get beat up by men and there girlfriends. Fuck this place. SHUT IT DOWN!Love love love their fried turkey sandwich!!!! Order it every time since the first time I ever tried it... Apple slices in pineapple juice is so addictive! Fries are good too and if you don't feel like soda then get their bottle of water always cold and just right on a hot dayMy first time here for Sunday morning brunch and I loved it. It was pretty busy at 10am when we went but we were seated pretty quickly. 

I ordered two eggs, bacon and french toast and the hubby ordered two eggs, sausage with a Belgian waffle and we both had a side of home fries. Lesson learned...WAY too much food, but it was yummy!

I had scrambled eggs and they were light and fluffy and the French Toast was really tasty and two thick slices with my order. It came with a whole pile of bacon and my side order of home fries was pretty good, maybe could have been seasoned a bit more, but a dash of salt and pepper and we were good to go.

Hubby had over easy eggs and wasn't as impressed with his sausage, saying it tasted as though it had been steamed, but maybe a hit on the griddle would have made it better for his preferences. His Belgian waffle was goos, but my guess from my taste would be from a mix, though tasty, nothing to get too excited over. 

I had to get a take home box for the second slice of toast and most of my home fries. I had bacon left too, but the hubby took care of that for me :-)

Our server was good, perhaps not great fretting to bring the ketchup I requested and not quite being on the ball with glass refills. It was busy and wasn't bad enough to go on about it further, just a note for whomever reads here 

I would go back for sure and recommend it for others. Reasonably priced between $6-$9 and lots of options. Go check it out!Highly disappointed, sushi quality was subpar at best. The highlight of the meal was the dessert and they still managed to mess it up. Will not returnAverage at best food at ridiculous prices. I ordered the chef special butter chicken with white rice, the portions are small - a bowl of sauce with a few pieces of chicken. The flavours were very average, nothing to rave about. The most frustrating thing is that a $16 main dish does not even come with rice, and I only found out when I got the bill, they charged me $5 for rice. For a meal that costed $30 after tax and tips, I essentially had a bowl of sauce on white rice. Simply despicable. Never again.BEAUTIFUL ambiance on the 3rd floor with views of the city. Nice place to relax and enjoy a date or friends. The food was amazing and the drinks were on point. Great place for a Stacation or Baecation! Love it.Ho Ho Cherry House is the best place for a quick, tasty lunch! Usually they have two specials, one vegetarian and one meat, that run between $3.99 and $4.99. We generally just order one of both and always have extra to chow down on later. We religiously order from Ho Ho at least 5x a month and love that they deliver, too!L'ancien Steak Frites Saint-Paul n'est plus. Cet ersatz le remplace et les clients ne gagnent pas au change. Le rapport qualité\/prix est nettement moins intéressant qu'avant.1 star is too much for this place. No flavor, lack of seasoning, & low quality ingredients are the reoccurring theme at this overpriced Resturant .  First off , They charge you for chips n salsa which is free at virtually every Mexican Resturant . The salsa is bland & no flavor.  
The ceviche trio was NOT fresh n we had to send back. The Chef try's to get too creative with his ceviche recipes as one is more disgusting n lacking flavor or seasoning as the next.  Way overpriced fajitas , which once again had zero flavor , no seasoning and very low quality meat (steak). They basically give u about 7-8 pieces of very fatty meat and load up on the vegetables and get u for $18. The chicken quesadilla literally smelled like that stuff u find between ur toes. We basically ate almost nothing and they credited us for most of the food. When the waitress agrees that the quality had gone done hill fast , it's never a good sign. Would never go back even if they comped the entire meal . I'm embarrassed for this place and the Mgr. seems so aloof to the problems . There are way better places to eat in Las Vegas for the same $$ , don't waste ur time n money at this place.Finally a good kbbq place in Henderson! Lots of variety in terms of their meats and appetizers. Tastes delicious! 

We received great service from Howard and he was very kind about bringing us whatever we needed.Nice staff, great food, clean, quiet, comfortable. I ordered a Vegas Roll, which was crispy and spicy and creamy. I also ordered some Takoyaki, and that was delicious as well.Been wanting to come here for awhile to try it out, today I came and we sat outside. Really cool Pittsburgh atmosphere! And the food was better than expected! I hear they are known for their burgers and I can see why! I started with a Caesar salad, which was very good, and also way bigger than expected for the price. Then I had the candied jalapeno burger and it was AMAZING! Definitely adding this to my list of favorite local spots!!!This is just an outstanding restaurant; it doesn't matter that it's vegan. The food was very well prepared, both as apps,mains and desserts. As well as smoothies--I had a pumpkin one that was like drinking pumpkin pie. Outstanding eggplant curry, special of the day and kale salad were the standouts. Service was a bit upset-oriented but enthusiastic and knowledgeable. I definitely will go back.Wow can't say enough how great this place is!  The Poke was delicious. My taste buds are craving my next visit!  Even if your just visiting this is a must stop while in town and if you live in Vegas what are you waiting for. The fish was fresh and tasty. I can't wait to go back and try some of the different sauces. Great people great food will be back soon!!! See you tomorrow!Only gave this place a 3 star as the quality of the buffet doesn't match the price and the wait to get in. The seafood station was very small with only oysters, crab legs (snow and stone), snails and shrimp. The crab were not that sweat and flavorful and the oysters were not super succulent. Probably the best was the sea snails.

The meat section was OK, with the Prime Rib taking the stage. The other cuts, and there were only wagyu beef and chicken were not moist and tender.

The sushi section was also quite small, with only salami, tuna, shrimp and unagi. Fish was ok but nothing special.

All in all fairly underwhelming buffet for all the hype.  Maybe worthwhile once for the experience but won't be back again.Went here for lunch today. It was their grand opening. Quite busy as it was the lunch hour and right across the street from the Court house so a lot of county employees. Plus they offered a free taco for their grand opening which was an additional draw. The location is shared with the future Sultan's Grill, in a food court like open space. The tables appeared were mismatched and at least a few of them appeared to be purchased used, possibly from a shut down Italian cafe, as they had Italian pictures painted on them and the chairs had paint chipping off which again indicates, used furniture, neither here nor there just making observations. They were not completely ready as they are still painting the logo on the wall and making other adjustments including not having all the menu items there for purchase yet. 

So as to the rating, I went back and forth on what to rate them - I know I have high standards and am critical and I know I am especially critical of taco places. Just having eaten at Taco y Taco last week and being a fan of Tacos El Gordo and Los Antojos, I just expect or prefer a authentic experience. Cilantro (which does not appear to be affiilated with the Cilantro on Rainbow\/Smoke Ranch) appears to be a chain, or at least have three other locations, in the Chicago area - and they state "A Taste of Chicago". Now, maybe I don't know much about Chicago but tacos are not the first thing that comes to mind when I think Chicago food. 

I ordered three tacos, barbacoa, al pastor and asada. The tacos were on corn tortillas and street taco style and size. I thought it was a bit pricey at $2 a pop. The meat did not have a lot of flavor and the barbacoa was quite fatty, and yes I know it is pork which is fatty but I bit into chunks of fat. That being sad the barbacoa was probably my favorite of the group - fat = flavor. Also ordered a tamale, I asked and they said it was house made. I ordered the pork, it was really really dry - so I doused it with hot sauce. The tamale was $2. I tried to order the chile relleno taco but they don't have chile relleno's yet. 

As to the service, maybe they are still working out the kinks as they just opened today but it was painfully, and I mean painfully slow - and 7 people working behind the counter. Plus, they need a microphone or a different way of calling out the numbers because they call the orders by number and it was really hard to hear them and in fact the customers were talking and relaying the numbers called amongst themselves. 

Also, I think that It would benefit them to provide a salsa bar to their patrons. They only provided salsa in bottles, likely house made but there was a green (tomatillo) salsa which was salty and did not have a lot of flavor, at least to me, and then a red spicier salsa. But the number of bottles were limited, I was lucky enough to snag a red one, but there were not enough for every table. Maybe they expect patrons to use the salsa bottles and leave them up there for others but I like to have ample salsa while I am dining.

After all this - I really do wish them well as they are a new business, and I am sure there is a segment of the population that will love and adore their food. Like I said before I am critical but wanted to not let the fact that this is their first review change how I would normally review things, and I would have given them three stars but for the service.I am a fan of this place. They are open until late. I was too early to catch the Megabus from Charlotte. I happen to find this place accidentely, as the place next to it, Eaglespeak was about to close.

They got good coffee, muffins, and desserts. I had a cup of coffee on my way to catch megabus on Friday late night. I went back again on Monday morning after my trip from Washington DC. This is good and have comfortable seating. 

Overall a nice place to pick up some coffee and desserts.Liked the small restaurant with the fantastic pizza! Good service with knowledgeable servers about beer types.Only giving this one star because I have to buy it definitely doesn't deserve one. If you have ever had food from any of the other Viva el tacos you would know how delicious their food is, but this location unfortunately has much lower standards. Food quality is horrible. The carne asada meat they use is disgusting and full of fat. Also they charge extra for drinks, unlike the other locations. On my order specifically I asked for no Pico De Gallo on my carne asada fries and instead of making me new fries like they should they picked out the pieces in the one they first gave me. Truly such a nasty experience. Hopefully you get the chance to try out one of the other locations because this one is horrible.I got the red curry and it was flavorful and well made. The crazy noodle had well made noodles, the best I've ever had. The shrimp was very good. Children had fried rice and it all got eaten. Best restaurant experience we've had in Cleveland area.We ordered the blueberry hill, the southern fried chicken and the strawberry milkshake. Got here at 4pm in Sunday, it wasn't busy at all and that was perfect.

The blueberry hill was amazing the first few bites. It was SO sweet! After a while, it got too much.
One person cannot and should not finish it by themselves. The southern fried chicken was also good but the chicken to waffle ratio was not good. It was one small piece of chicken for a huge waffle.

The server was really nice and I loved her! Our water could have been refilled more but that's not a big deal.

I liked the restaurant and the location. I've just never ate so much sugar in one sitting...My incident that I'm writing about took place months ago, but due to JUST reading about other negative experiences on social media, I've decided to come here and tell MY story. 

 A friend of mine was on tour and playing the venue. He'd put me on the guest list. I'd JUST picked up my tickets at the box office when a large security guard approached. I had two tickets in my hand that he'd taken, which I thought he was about to scan and let me in. He then asked me to step outside. 

I saw someone outside the venue that I wasn't very fond of before I came in. I said nothing to them to provoke an incident, as I wasn't there for drama. They approached security and told them that I'd threatened to "slit their throat". I told the security guard this was a blatant lie. Not only did I NOT intend to kill anyone, I wasn't carrying an instrument to perform such a heinous act. He had a hand held metal detector and I asked him to use it. He told me it didn't matter, I wasn't coming in. He told me I had no choice but to leave. I was already outside and asked him to call the manager. He told me I had to get off their property, which I ALREADY WAS! We were standing in the Linq thoroughfare. 

Despite him threatening me, I refused to leave until I spoke with a manager. He was intimidating in a way that seemed he would have gotten physical if he weren't in plain view of hundreds of tourists passing by. 

When the manager came, with two other security guards, I calmly explained to him that I came there to have a good time seeing my friend's band play and NOT to kill anyone. I further explained that I've NEVER been to prison, that I intended to keep it that way, and as a grown man was QUITE well aware of the consequences of killing someone, ESPECIALLY in a public place. 

The manager STILL wasn't going to allow me in. So I went further by telling them that I've worked as venue security myself, which I have. I told him that I'd NEVER seen anything so ignorant as far as security goes to listen to hearsay and deny someone entry with NOTHING to back it up. I even said that I respected their job since I've done it myself, but that they were going the wrong way about it. NONE of that mattered to them. 

I was then told that even if my friend who was playing were to come out and give me an all access pass and walk me in, I'd STILL be denied. To say I was livid is an understatement. I asked for my tickets back so I could pass them along to someone else who'd like to see the show, and they wouldn't even give me MY tickets! 

I'm hearing other VERY similar stories on how the security and management behaves. I've even heard that they're intimidating to women without real provocation. This isn't security, these are PUNKS who are going to ultimately piss off the wrong person who can handle multiple security guards at one time and teach them a lesson the hard way. 

Needless to say, I have NOTHING nice to say about this place. I've LITERALLY missed shows I've wanted to see because they're booked there. I will NOT be patronizing them WITHOUT a full apology and a more friendly attitude. HOWEVER, I don't expect that to happen.

If I could give this place a pile of sh*t emoji instead of one star, I would!i have to say, food wise the qualty was excellent. Decor was equally impressive. Ordering system took a little getting used to, but no missed orders. staff were adequately attentive to needs. bonus, they offer tuna sashimi. left feeling i got very good value for the money. excellent out of place addition to a dumpy neighbourhoodFirst time in. Walk in the place is busy and the employees are working hard. Friday's special was shrimp and grits, which I'm not a fan of but everyone was ordering it. It was amazing I will definitely order again. Food was great service was great easy 5 starsProbably the best Felafel I've ever had. Ambiance is a bit low brow but the service is top notch and the food is the BOMB!It was excellent right up until the waitress commented "uh water only...uh hmmm"  kinda insulting.  

the escargot was excellent, Caesar salad not great but huge, French onion soup cheese was not browned or crusty and broth...I've had better at the local pub. rack of lamb was spectacular. crispy edges tender and seasoned perfectly. forgot our asparagus in the kitchen. overall good meal...average quality meal when considering priceThis place has industrial decor. It is clean and inviting and  well done inside. Staff was very friendly, welcoming  and helpful they really knew the menu and it was  helpful when picking a drink choice our waitress was wonderful. .. sadly I for got her name. Some things on the menu were not appealing to me so I went with the fish n chips... which to my surprise was not a sandwich. It was a large beer battered fillet, with slaw and I opted for the mac n cheese.. the mac and cheese was definitely a good choice. The fish was good as long as you peeled off the extremely greasy breading.  The name of the place also doesn't do it justice. But all and all we had a nice time. They have a huge drink\/beer selection. I would be willing to give the fish another try, hopefully the oozing greese will be non existent. Oh and please replace the clip board menu with steel\/brass rings instead of a clip, everything kept sliding all over. The food is also a bit over priced, My other half got the presidents salad and thought he said it was good it was really over priced for some lettuce and chicken. A few small tweaks and this place would be 5 stars all the way.Food is good, but portions are too small for their price. I ordered two tacos and an appetizer to split with another person and was still really hungry. $5\/taco with $12 app (basically 3 small tacos)My family and I stopped here for their $4.99 lunch and were pleasantly surprised by the quality.  My husband enjoyed his mahi mahi sandwich and son really liked the salmon and potatoes he ordered. I got the steak, which was a tiny bit chewy, but fine for a $4.99 steak.  We went back the next day and the big winner was the salmon salad- amazing.  The portions and quality were what you would get in a high end restaurant but for $4.99!  My family agreed that this place is a hidden gem in the high priced place that is Vegas.  Good service, good food and at a price that is refreshing.Great food and a unique experience but I probably won't go again.

Uncle Tetsu is known for their quality Japanese cheesecake.  I ordered the angel hat cheesecake and it was delicious!  It was so light and overall very satisfying!

The main selling point of this location is the maid cafe aspect.  While the experience of seeing waitresses dressed as maids (trying to replicate maid cafes in Japan) is cool, I didn't get the maid cafe experience I was expecting.

The waitresses (maids) were dressed up but didn't do anything out of the norm.  They also weren't as attentive.

Overall, the food is fantastic but the maid cafe aspect was lost.  It was cool to see what Uncle Tetsu tried to do but I would prefer one of their other locations.Mediocre experience. Inattentive and lackluster service, expensive mass produced beers, boring food. My friend got a burger and said it tasted like one of those frozen patties you get in packs of 100- he maybe should have taken the hint when they said they "Don't do rare or medium"  $14 salad was honestly hilarious- small bowl of mesclun and some chopped apples with a little ball of cheese. I got linguini with ragu sauce- no complaints but no surprises. The only positive I can say was they messed up our order of calamari and gave us a large when we asked for a small, so that made up for the other stuff a little bit.

I couldn't tell what type of restuarant it was from the outside, but I decided it is "wannabe upscale italian bistro"Not sure what makes their food Sinaloa style (maybe the unique set of spices for the chicken), the menu appeared to be border-style street food with a wholesome and contemporary twist. Everything I ordered at Kiss Pollos was very flavorful and the ingredients were remarkably fresh.

This is not a typical dollar taco shop, they specialize in chicken and potatoes prepared in unorthodox ways. For example, there are eclectic items on the menu such the salad taco, mini pizza made with tortillas, nacho-infused chicken tacos.

I came to try a salad taco and their famous kiss chicken taco, both of which cost a little more than $1. The salad taco consisted of a potato salad ball and some leafy greens wrapped in a supple flour tortilla. The cold potato salad was savory and surprisingly not too heavy. It did have a slightly acquired taste initially, so it was very different but in a positive and creative way. I preferred the chicken taco a little more, because the chicken was thoroughly roasted over charcoal and had profound chargrilled flavor. I'm a fan of the bitter-smoky flavors (not overdone) in the chicken, I thought that it was expertly prepared.

For both tacos, flour tortillas were used rather than corn tortillas. Kiss Pollo's flour tortillas tasted like they were homemade with greater thickness, durability, and elastic texture compared to the fragile store-bought tortillas commonly served at dollar taco stands.

The most attractive feature at Kiss Pollo was their salsa bar. Every single item there was fresh and neatly presented. The salsas and vegetables looked like they were prepared just an hour ago. There were more condiments to dress up the tacos compared to most salsa bars I've seen in California. For example, I found pickled red onions, Mexican cheese, and cucumbers.

I don't mind coming back for some grilled chicken tacos when I visit Phoenix again!Great service and generous food portions. Nachos were delicious. Our server Rodney was exceptional.  I recommend a visit.Came here while we were in town visiting family this past Saturday night, and I would say without even reading other reviews on Yelp, I immediately thought wow, do they even know we are out here?

We had requested outdoor seating, and they put a table together really quick for us, however, no one came to give us menus until we had to run back inside to remind them we were here. The waitress was very nice and helpful, she asked how we liked our food prepared and suggested appropriate spice levels, however, getting our wine, appetizers, food and even the check was a very long process. 

I don't know if it has to do with kitchen organization or just a lack of needed staff. But do not come here if you are on a schedule. 

The food is great - no complaints there! It wasn't the best Indian food I've ever had, but it really got the job done. We asked for Chef Hot and it actually came out spicy! We did enjoy it. I recommend the Tandoori Chicken,  Lamb TIkka Masala, Lamb Biryani and Naan!

In sum, good food, slow service, a good place to go if you're NOT in a rush to get anywhere after. Also, do not come here when you're on the brink of starvation, because by the time you get your food you might be on the floor.Ok my new favorite spot!! So good and fresh! The meat was not over cooked like some tend to be and the vegetables were not all soggy but had a nice little crunch. A must try!!To : Mar G.
Mesa, AZ

No I never yelled at her, I was calm and just stated the facts. I work in retail, I know how to talk to people. Something they obviously don't train McDonald's workers how to do. I don't need sub standard service or food, So I choose not to spend my money there any more.4 stars because our server Nancy was very attentive in spite of valentines day crowd.. she definitely took care of us. We ordered a bottle of Moscato which is not bad for $31 and did the the 2 for 25... of course we did the specialty entrée with an additional price, we ordered the shrimp scampi, which I must say is very good for olive garden material, and new york strip steak.. The steak was tender and almost cook to perfection, there were some very dry parts, but that's okay... Over all the food was very decent...I visit Arizona Charles at least once a month for the $3.99 hamburger special.  I've had the breakfast deals here as well, again for the price I believe it's worth it.  

The four star review is based on the quick friendly service and the 24\/hr bargins.  In order to recieve the food deals, you need a players card.  Sign up its free. 

I like the sourdough cafe.  It's an old diner.  I would stick to breakfast, the hamburger and pastrami Sand which are all great deals. 

I suggest it as a go to spot if you want a quick, decent, cheap meal with friendly service. 

Also this last time I visited I was carded to get in, like others ive read happened to them before. I've been going to this cafe for 3 years now and have never been.id.  when I asked the manage at the front she was really rude about it.  Her response was "this is a casino!"? My response "Umm... ok?! .. " that did not explain why I was getting carded.  Even after asking the host why, it still made no sense. But whatever, I like the servers and the food. My tip goes to the servers not that manager. :-)Unfortunately,  large groups are forbidden to order from their regular menu forced instead to order from a preset and ridiculous group menu with limited offerings. Skip this place if you are a group of 6 or more and want a great meal.When I saw they had mabo sara udon I had to try it. The inside of Cherry Blossom's is nice and clean. It has this comfy feeling to it compared to a more modern style.

First up ordered some gyoza.  Those where a great way to start a meal.  They were so good I would have walked away happy if I ordered another round and just had that for lunch. There are some places are ok under Phoenix that just butcher gyoza\/potstickers and I'm usually disappoint.  So it was such a relief to finally have some that were well made.

Onto the mabo sara udon.  I'm kind of tilorn by it.  On one had it was good.  It was a lot spicer then I would have expected.  I only say that because the mabo tofu I have at Chinese places doesn't pack a lot of heat.  That part wasn't the bad.  I think for me there was something missing.  For example it wad like a hot fudge Sunday without the nuts.  It's still good but something was missing.  I would order it again in the future though.

Overall pretty happy with the meal.I had purchased a gift certificate on Restaurant.com and knew nothing about this business. I do love sushi and Teppanyaki though and was excited. When I went in to use it, they refused to honor it. We ended up having a terrific meal but the aggravation from the server and the manager was not worth it. I went back to use the gift certificate for take out and was told I could not, that it was only dine-in. Again a big hassle. I talked to the manager and she did not care that I was put out; she did not care that I was trying to patronize the restaurant (albeit in the comfort of my home). Very nasty and they don't care about making new customers or keeping the ones they have. Must be the reason it is so empty the two times I have been there and the reason they are having to discount and advertise on Restaurant.com so heavily.Service was Horrible! 
Ordered 3 rolls and appetizer. The rolls came out 20 minutes before the appetizer. Never visited by the waiter to see if we needed anything or if the food was ok. For a Friday night the wait staff should have been more organized.For those of us who prefer small dive bars, dark pubs, killer clowns, and the blues brothers, then this is the bar for you. If you've driven down Independence Blvd. then you've probably seen a small bar called "Yesteryears" or as some refer to it as "Goodtimes"...oh and what a goodtime you will have. Unless you are dying of hunger and enjoy childhood memories of a cutup hot dog that your mom gave to you when you were 5 years old I wouldn't recommend eating here. 

However for a die hard karaoke enthusiast like myself there is no place better, the beer is cold the drinks are cheap, and the jello shots are plenty. Don't forget to give the bartender Skunk a big tip he is awesome.Collin is very sweet and very professional.. I ordered the chicken and waffles, cinnamon pancakes and my friend ordered the fancy steak omelette . i didn't really like the chicken and waffles but the go go juice was good and very refreshing.. i will definitely come back for the pancakes, go go juice & the great service!!! Thanks again Collin, youre awesome! :)Overall, I would say this place Is pretty solid. Fresh ingredients and they make everything right in front of you so you know they're going to get it right. 

I usually go with the protein bowls and they're pretty tasty. They also have half and half combos if you're looking for a nice soup and sandwich. 

A great place for lunch and all entrees come with a chocolate dipped strawberry! Nice.First time trying poke and The Poke Guys made the experience a beautiful one.

I went for their Cali Bowl and was not disappointed as it offered a great blend of flavours and taste into the world of poke.  It just works.

You get to try both the classic marinated salmon and tuna poke along with avocado, crab meat slaw, and fried onions.  I went ahead and added some corn and edamame beans to my bowl too. MmmmmmmmMmmMMMMm.

I think the price is very fair for something that is healthy, fresh, and filling.

Definitely will come back again when I am in the mood for poke.I've always wanted to try a French Bakery and a friend of mine from Austria says that this is an authentic as it gets.  Honestly, I had some of the best croissants I've ever had!  I couldn't believe how chewy and flavorful the almond croissant was.  I've never had anything like it in my life.  I'll be back for sure, but I have to be careful since I know I'll put on the weight eating there!Came here to redeem a dinner with our Vacations Hawaii coupon.. ehh it was okay. Not that bad, but wouldn't get the prime rib again. Really chewy and flavor wasn't that great for me. Service was okay.This cozy restsurant in Summerlin is under a new ownership and the food is delicious. The atmosphere is quiet and more upscale than casual. I tried the special of the day, roasted leg of lamb. It was prepared to perfection and the size of the dish was giant. It can easily feed two people, but I managed to finish it by myself (because I have bigger"talent" than most people.)

Mykonos offers a great selection of high-end Greek wine and beers. Ouzo is coming soon. 

At the end the friendly owner surprised me with a small Greek desert on the house. 

I'll be back with my friends soon.This place is a dump. Went here around 330am after Boo! 2017 on Sept 14th. Ordered a grand slam breakfast and never felt more ripped off. The texture of the bacon and sausage was disgusting. Flavor even worse, I'm sure these were old and remicrowaved since it was like soggy paper when you bit into it. My scrambled eggs were cold and the cheese on top made it look like plastic. The toast was horribly overdosed with butter. The only passable part of my meal was the hash browns. Paid around 13 dollars for this train wreck and it's so disappointing. Paid for my friend's meal and mine so we could leave asap I just didn't wanna deal with this place any longer and left. Won't be coming back as the quality of service was not up to par, just a sad excuse for service and a restaurant, do yourself a favor and go elsewhere these places just aren't what they used to be a decade ago.Someone needs to teach these people how to make a breakfast burrito.  This is the first time I have had a breakfast burrito with very little egg and completely stuffed with spanish rice.  First of all, who puts spanish rice in their breakfast burrito?  Honestly, they should focus on the taste of the breakfast burrito instead of profits by stuffing it with rice.  I'll never stop by there again.Sat in the bar and ordered a quesedila. 40 mins later asked if my order was still coming, the response was yes. So at that point I just ordered it to go. Upon arriving back at my room and eating, realized the chicken was burnt and quesedila was below par. My recommendation is not to eat here.Nice atmosphere, great service, very reasonable price

Food was delicious and you also get unlimited refills on rice, miso soup and salad. Definitely will be coming back.Big portions for what you pay. Chicken is amazing.  And the potatoes and fries are great.  Very crispy without being too oily.  However the place is understaffed so it'll take some time to get your food especially if it's busy.I've eaten here a couple of times. Also had take-out, which was a bad experience because I found out the order was not complete when I got home.

The food is quite good, and I find that the place is generally kind of quiet. It's better for the ambiance when some Desi movies are on the TV.

Back to the food - it tastes great and is pretty good value. Don't order too much naan - they are huge.

The downside is that they do not serve alcohol, which is a miss for me when having a dinner on a Saturday night.This was our first time here. Dining area is small and with small tables and tight seating it wouldn't  be comfortable for more than 2 people at once.  Although there are four chairs to a table there's no way four adults would fit comfortably. This is the reason for 4 stars & not 5. We did not use their bathrooms therefore cannot comment on their cleanliness. 
Service: was very good and very attentive. Food: tasted great! The pastor tacos came out sizzling hot, the ceviche tostadas were a lot bigger than anticipated and the shrimp cocktail was quite large as well.This place is adorable. The name suits it well. They have great service and very friendly staff. Wait time isn't bad and the food is delicious. It is on the pricey side. I would only go there if I am splurging out with people. They have good variety of food to pick from. It's a cute sit down place to enjoy quality time with people.I think I've found my new favourite Italian restaurant in the city! 
Oretta is a pleasure to visit. Great staff, awesome atmosphere, and phenomenal food! 
I highly recommend the salad! The tiramisu was one of the best ones we've ever had in a restaurant!I always go in there saying I'm going to try something new but then I always end up getting the club (add banana peppers). I am never disappointed with the club so why change it up? If it aint broke dont fix it! Penn Station also has AMAZING lemonade (coming from someone who doesn't even like lemonade). Fries and cookies are a must try too!Nice BBQ place in Mathews , NC. It is hidden behind another restaurant. It is attached in the back. I can't say the signage is that good to find it but it is worth it. I have used them for a large pick up order before and stopped in for the lunch time brown bag special. 

The brown bag special will fill you up and the meat is quality. You can choose between several sauces so pick your pleasure. They heap on the meat and it is slightly smokey but holds the moisture well.

The ribs are above average (I got them for a gathering) they where somewhat expensive but quality. They did not fall off the bone and a few were kinda tough but they served the purpose and the pulled pork made up for it.

They do not have seats inside the store it is only pickup so plan accordingly.I brought my brother to vegas for birthday present and i was happy to stay in stratoaphere since it has thrill rides on top. Also i wanted to have fun at the radius pool today since hotel guests are free. I bought swimwear and shirt to go there but when i arrived there at 8:15 pm yesterday (apr 14th) employees said we have to pay 22 dollars per person since it is after 6pm.
I didnt see any comment on the website we have to pay after 6pm or no one mentioned there is a fee after 6pm.
How come no one notified guests and make us waste money and time. we cancelled dinner reservation and came back to hotel from the strip because of this.
Yesterday was my last day at this hotel and i cant use it any more.
These guys should change information on the website or make it free for guest because thats what you guys said on the website.
I still didnt receive any explanation from the hotel.You can tell the cook is different. The food was not appealing today at all in taste. We ordered cabbage and oxtails with rice and peas. The soda was luke warm, the tea was sugar water. There was nothing authentic to the Caribbean at all and nothing like our last experience.

The owner was in the kitchen cooking the meals the last couple of time we came and today was a disappointment.I LOVED the idea of a gluten free restaurant in my neighborhood and have gone on several occasions to enjoy the fare. 

Sadly, the service is atrocious and often leaves me scratching my head. Yes, I was in the industry and so I am likely a little biased but when you wait 5 minutes after being seated to even receive water and silverware? To see multiple open tables and then be told they are on a 45 minute wait? (yes, I understand how seating works) A few weeks ago I was told there was a 20 minute wait. I decided to stick around but noticed 4 open tables. After 15 minutes we were finally seated at one of the open tables and during our dining experience two of the others never filled. 

Once for brunch I asked about the omelette special and was told "it's some pork chop thing. We served pork chops last night." Not only did I not get any details about the special but I was also told that we were having last night's dinner for breakfast. Even though I know that is how the business works you DON'T tell the customer that!!! 

I might go back again and sit at the bar on a slow night but I won't take my friends or family there anymore. It's just too painful to watch.Found this place in the Yelp list Thursday night 8:15 pm after the first two LAKEWOOD pizza places I called didn't answer the phone. Very pleasantly surprised at getting a great 14" thin crust pizza with unlimited toppings for $15.99, ready for pickup 20 minutes after I called.
They just opened a couple of weeks ago, located in a small storefront on St Charles just south of Detroit (behind Panera and Beltone outlet). Small menu, three pizza sizes with choice of over a dozen toppings, four kinds of 8" sub sandwiches, and soda. Menu cites Stromboli on the top, but they haven't worked that one out yet given their current baking equipment.
Price is good, tasty pizza, and very convenient pick-up site for hungry Lakewoodites!On a random night off, a friend of mine and I decided to head over to Town Square for a movie. Our plan was to hit up a Happy Hour scenario after the flick, and Double Helix wine bar fit the bill. I hadn't been in for over a year since it opened, and back when they were starting out it was kind of quiet. I was happy to see that business had picked up. 

The bartender was really great, the happy hour specials were cool and the style of the place is nice. It's a bit mis-matchy in design, but that's for another review :) in any event I'm sure I'll be back down for a cocktail or two as they have a descent bourbon collection and I'm a fan of that. The food was just ok in my opinion, but that's relative I suppose. Basic and good for drinking, flat-breads and items of the sort. Check it out if you get a chance. Happy Eating!Excellent food and excellent service.


If you're looking for a quick stop for super good food, here's your place.

We ordered the combo beef and kurabuto pork. If you haven't had kurabuto pork, you're missing out. I'm a super duper pork fan. And anytime I see kurabuto, I have to get it.

We also had the spicy miso broth and the tonkatso broth. I liked the tonkatso more, but my fiance liked the miso better.

It's also very clean and organized here. I loved that all of the waiters were very knowledgeable, helpful and quick. 

I just wish they had alcohol. A cold asahi would have been perfect. We saw others with alcohol. So I'm assuming you can bring your own with a fee.

Overall, it was awesome. I can't wait to go back and try different meats and broths.Best cake ever!  I've loved everything I've ordered here from the food, cakes, cookies, and drinks!  This is a place I always take my family and friends when they visit.  It's a real treat!This chain has become one of my favorite restaurants.  We stopped in to this location for first time several days ago.  We were greeted with friendly smiles and genuine charming hospitality.  Leslie,  our waitress,  made us feel right at home.  The food was prepared fresh,  hot,  cooked to order.  The rolls were hot and yummy!  Wow,  I'm not much of a bread eater but these were fabulous.  As a woman who appreciates good home-cooked meals, respects the foods from our gardens\/farms this is as close as it gets. The kitchen\/chefs at this location did a superb job on the "pot roast" meal. For the one who did a bad review, well I just don't get it. One thing, you never go into a restaurant near closing and expect superb anything.  That's just disrespectful.  But the ones with negative reviews leave major facts out! I will now become a regular at this one. My money was well spent here, especially at this location with the chain restaurant.  The best thus far!!!! High five to all affiliated with this one.Now this is a burger. Try the fries with brisket they melt in your mouth. Love going and the food and drinks makes the wait worth it every time. Sit at the bar and you'll get a good feel for the place.Probably the best meal we had on our stay.  Our party started out meeting at the bar for drinks pre-meal, and it's a nice little  place, right off the gaming floor for good people-watching.  The bartender was probably the nicest we met the whole time we were at the Wynn or in Las Vegas, to be honest.  I'm not a frou-frou drink person, but the Blackberry Bliss cocktail was calling my name with its fresh crushed blackberries.  Pretty darned good.  The house pinot noir followed us from the bar to our table, as well.  

Moving on to dinner, the roasted garlic bulb appetizer was better than I can even make at home, as were the pizzas.  Our party ended up getting pasta entrees; one got the angel hair pomodoro, one got linguine and white clam sauce, and the rest of us were swayed by the Maine lobster fra diavolo.  Now, our time spent in Las Vegas's resort eateries had taught me not to expect more than a chintzy portion, especially where seafood is concerned.  Not the case, here, at  all.  There were so many huge chunks of lobster in my pasta that I barely even touched the pasta itself before I was totally full...which, sadly, meant no nutella-stuffed beignets or tiramisu  for me.  Oh, well...something to plan a return trip for!  Super nice, attentive service, as well, which was also something we'd learned in mere days not to necessarily expect in Vegas.  It was our last night there, and a GREAT way to end the trip...Stratta left a very good taste in our mouths, literally and figuratively.The worst, I repeat, the worst Chinese food ever!! I bought General tso's chicken only to find out that the chicken was triple fried and old and you could barely even taste the chicken because of all the batter. Don't eat from this place, you're better off buying frozen dinner from a convenience store!We came here recently for lunch and were excited about the food based on the Uber driver recommendation and the pictures we saw online. The food was definitely solid and we had a good meal but we were not blow away by any of the dishes. Everything was good and there was a nice mix of options on the menu.The best place has the best OJ!  The service is good, it well lit and clean. This location has more seating downstairs or you can enjoy a street level view.Here what we had:

1. Eggplant parmigiana with spaghetti.  Requested not to put cheese on MY PASTA.  The last time they did, it had too much cheese on it.  So today I said: no cheese on my pasta.  The result:  No cheese on my eggplant parmigiana either.  How do you leave out the cheese on eggplant PARMIGIANA?  I didn't say anything. I ate it.  The red sauce was good though.  

2.  Ordered chicken cutlet with an eggplant cutlet on top of it, WITH SAUCE  (spicy, please), NO CHEESE.  The result:  A weight-watchers portion of chicken, meaning, it would FIT IN THE PALM OF YOUR HAND--AND IT DID.  90% of the plate was filled with penne pasta with sauce.  Hubby did say the chicken was super-delicious---what there was of it.  I never saw anything so small but he didn't complain to the waiter--I would have.  And the cost of this weight-watchers piece of chicken?? $21.50 American dollars --wow.  The last time we were here it was a regular portion and when we go to their Scottsdale location, the portion is quite large so we were shocked by the smallness of the chicken portion in relation to the cost.  
3  The complimentary garlic bread was tasty.
4.  The mushroom soup which comes with the meal was very delicious.   The salad was mostly  greens and one slice of tomato but was fresh.  
5. Were given Complimentary Sambuca at the end of the meal. but we would have preferred more chicken in the dish instead.
6.  I really prefer the on-line menu to match the restaurant menu.  This is a case when it did not.  So you come in ready to order what you want and it is not on the menu.  
7.  Nice piped in music with mostly italian classics.  Nice.  The waiters singing along with the music, not so nice.  
Trace was our server.  
A tad disappointed today.The bartenders anywhere at The Bellagio are top notch, however, the bartenders here take things to the next level.  We had drinks here a few times, and each time, I felt as though I were transported back to a time where customer service and quality mattered much more than trendy drinks and name dropping.  Great place!Chef Oscar is amazing! We had a sangria sampler followed my 2 pitchers of sangria. The watermelon and the red sangria were our 2 choices for the evening and did not disappoint! The chef sent out his queso fundito to get us started. We had 5 entrees served family style. Halibut, camarones a la diabla, short ribs, and the Del patron for 2. Everything was perfect! The halibut and the shrimp were my personal favorites. The chef wouldn't let us leave without tasting his bread pudding... Nothing short of heavenly. The ambiance was quaint and and sophisticated. I highly recommended!This Labor Day my love suprized with sat morn spontaneous getaway, Rooms were big. All around really Layed back. Party time at the pool was an awesome option!  Ordered late night food that was great and arrived Very fast the 24 hr room service (always great. )Sunday morn. Was  build your own Sunday bloody Mary's !!They had  very stocked variety filled mini bar .. , a very friendly staff , LOVED the spacious room with tub in the middle very retro. Convenient location with lots too do all around. Over all was a good experience. I recommend it.The food is a breath of fresh air not only for Lorain but in general!!! So very fresh and flavorful!! Excellent place for lunch!!!Still delicious, still intimate, still one of the best in Vegas.

We hit up Raku again now that they've expanded, allowing a few more people to experience this fantastic place at a single time.  Do yourself a favor and don't walk in - you likely won't get a table.  Even on a Tuesday, at 6PM.  They're likely booked to 11 by then.  Reserve your table a day or so in advance and get in your 2 guaranteed hours of amazing food and intimate setting.

This time, we once again ordered the Agedashi Tofu, because... you can't NOT order it.  Even if you don't like tofu, you will love this dish.

A special we tried this time were the small fresh crabs, lightly fried and served posed on a small long dish, as if they're in a little procession of deliciousness... right into your mouth.  They're maybe each as big as a 50 cent piece.  You pop the entire thing into your mouth and chew.  In a word - amazing.  I'm not a big crab lover, but these were tasty, well seasoned, and delicious.  The shell on them is so light there's no worry of impaling your mouth with a piece of them.  My wife devoured them and we almost ordered seconds.  She talked about them on the way home.  The next day.  Just order them if they're available.

The core dishes that we re-visited from our previous trips are still excellent.  This time we also got 3 sake tasting special to sample with the meal and I was impressed not only with the choices (a filtered, an unfiltered, and a flavored one) but how inexpensive it was for the sampler ($14).  A good value and more than enough to keep a great mood through your meal.

As an update to my last post, I must say that Raku's desserts are quite excellent.  We've tried the different sorbets, the melty chocolate cake, the bubbly milk pudding, and they've all been wonderful.  Now if they only offered a Honey Toast dessert....

Raku is continuing proof of a growing array of excellent restaurants that you don't have to walk through a casino to find here in Vegas.  Don't miss it!As much as I love In-N-Out, I have to admit that Shake Shack is better all around. The fries, the hamburger meat, the cheese, the frozen custard shake are made of quality ingredients and deserve recognition. Price point is higher for that very reason. I'm so addicted to the perfect fries! Cheese lovers can order a side of cheese dip to keep the fries crisp. The shackburger left me wanting more. The shroomburger and the chicken sandwich are also amazing!So I come here for lunch quite a bit. I recommend getting the Tom Ka Chicken or Shrimp with rice in it, spiced to your comfort level. 
My coworker usually gets mint chicken allthough it's not on the menu. I also had the sweet and sour chicken and orange chicken. Affordable and good food. 

Hot tip! Listen for fighter jets if you wanna know if it's busy or not for lunch. Jets = not busy. No jets = busy. 

Yum yumBrought my family here for lunch because I remember how much I enjoyed it when last visiting NV, and we were famished while travelling from Canada to California - it was as big a hit with them as I had hoped.  The four adults shared the Feast for Two and two of the special appetizers (rib tips and nachos) and were too stuffed to finish.  

I could live on their corn muffins alone, I think.  They are just incredibly good -even one of the picky children fell in love with them.  Of course their meats are delicious - great chicken, ribs, and brisket, each one special and ready to be doused with any of the six hot sauces - I liked mixing the Sweet and Zesty with the Texas Fire.  And don't miss their Mac n Cheese - rich and satisfying.

For dessert we passed around a huge slice of Key Lime Pie (could have been tarter) and a Bread Pudding (great glaze on it, accompanied by Vanilla Bean ice cream).

Love, love, love this place - too bad it'll be another several years before I get a chance to return, but it'll definitely always be on my itinerary!!Staff is terrible!  They don't pay attention to any tables and you can be sitting there for 2 hours without anyone coming over to check if you need anything. 
At least the dessert here is good. We had the green tea waffle.  Milkshakes are just ok, too much ice.I have been many places, had many bagels, and I am typically disappointed in the experience, so what a pleasure to visit Forever Bagel.

I always want to get the toasted bagel with cream cheese and eat it as a little breakfast sandwich, but 10 times out of 10 you get an over toasted bagel, or a really tough bagel, or runny cream cheese and bam....it suck!

But now I am 2 for 2 at Forever Bagel.  Great tasting bagels that are not too tough and very flavorful.  Cream cheese that is solid and does not simply drip out.  I have had the Honey Oat and Cinnamon Maple bagels thus far and neither disappointed.  Pumpkin cream cheese (we, as a society have overdone the pumpkin thing, but I still like it!) was delicious as well.

And the price.....I almost fell over it was so low!  Coffee is good as well.  

The location knocks it down a star....very difficult to get heading back in the correct direction after a visit, but such is life for good, inexpensive bagels!   So skip Panera and hit Forever Bagel if you have the choice!The cashier wearing the name tag Michaelangelo was an outstanding employee. I went in with the intention of buying a BigMac meal large size and the smallest size order of chicken nuggets. He SOLD me and said that the smallest mcnugget (4 piece) was approx 2.99 and that for a few more bucks I could get a 20 piece. Point taken and I got both the meal and 20 mcnuggets. The drink area was in a disarray but he went out of his way to make sure everything was back up to standards. (I was observing this while I was eating my food order). Overall great experienceThe Bartender Rachel was incredibly nice and helped me picked out the Cilantro Jalapeño Hummus with Chicken on top! The service was excellent and I was a priority while the food was decent. It wasn't much food for the $10.54 I spent without a drink but I will most likely revisit to try something else.I went to this newly opened spring china house. Food was what I expected and the service was well mannered and timely. My girlfriend and I will be ordering from them again!I was thrown a surprise birthday party here a few years back and have enjoyed coming here for after work drinks, dinner and drinks or just because drinks.  Happy Hour is where it's at!
 I really enjoy the quaint ambience and the food is very good as well. I didn't find it cheap or overly expensive. The atmosphere takes the edge off of a long day and the staff has always been helpful and friendly. Check it out! Interesting menu.Great Mexican food in a nice atmosphere.  Great views of the city.  Every item I have had (over ten visits) has been wonderful.  Complete full bar and every ingredient is fresh.  Very good service.  You can't go wrong here.

Las Vegas residents are spoiled with high quality Mexican food everywhere.  You cannot get this quality anywhere in Florida.  Enjoy your good fortune.  "Save water, drink beer."I had a fantastic experience here recently.

The patio is wonderful, great for people watching. It's literally on Public Square. The inside was lovely too. Classy without being even remotely stuffy or formal. The restrooms were very clean and the open kitchen is a nice touch.

The service was wonderful. Our waiter was friendly, attentive (without being overly so), and helpful. 

There were a lot of affordable options on the wine list and the white that I shred with my dining companion was inexpensive and perfect- neither too sweet or too dry. It was featured under their Interesting Wines section.

The salads that we ordered were fantastic. I would guess that all of their salads would be as such. My friend had the bacon and fixings for her entree, which she really enjoyed. Its presentation was wonderful. I had the duck confit nachos. They were delicious. We shared a side of their jalapeño and caramelized onion man & cheese as well, which was some of the best mac & cheese I've ever had. Everything was extremely affordable, particularly for the high quality. 

Be sure to check out Pura Vida if you get the chance!Every year I come to Vegas I stayed in treasure island. But I knows they don't change bed  sheet 3 night in the rows. And I feel disgusted and I will not stay there ever again.We ordered Vegetable Chowmein and Panang Tofu. 
Panang Tofu was really delicious with amazing flavours of grounded peanuts and coconut.
Chowmein was okayish.
Would give it a try only for the Panang Tofu.Got lamb platter and spicy chicken sandwich... there is a reason why everyone raves about the spicy chicken sandwich... it's just so so so perfect!  I took a bite of it and wish I could have a hundred more bites but it wasn't my sandwich . I had the big plate and it was very good too but just not the chicken sandwich!  

Skip the fancy brunch or lunch place and come here!  

Cash only but they have an ATM machine and only charges $1 for withdrawal... so not the end of the world if you didn't bring $.I really enjoy the food and the excellent service , thank u Felix and chong
I always appreciate everything and the fact that u deliverHave you ever been to a store that the sales person is all over you that you get annoyed and leave the store even though you really like some of the cloths? I had the same feeling at Gusto 101. I guess they were just trying to be hospitable but they definitely overdid it. There was a waitress and then there was a hostess that asked us if everything was OK every 5 minutes and\/or if they should take our plates away.  It kinda felt like they were rushing us. They're using this great app to take names for the waitlist and orders, which is awesome, but the fact that waiter would just stand over our table to put the orders in on the app for 2 minutes after we ordered just made it too uncomfortable. 

I went there because I really wanted to try their on tap wine, but they didn't have any of the red wines so that was another disappointment.

The restaurant itself is beautiful, great design, and I'm sure once the patio opens it'll be a great hangout spot for a lot of people in that area. But inside is just too loud and too hot. 

Food was good. Nothing crazy though.The sushi is really good! Tempura soba was alright- guess I'm just not a huge fan of soba. 

Service was kinda slow, hence the one star down.I think it's implied that these guys have very tasty bagels. Especially, when they're toasted with cream cheese...mmm

They offer a decent breakfast menu, perfect for those lazy Saturday mornings when you want to go out for breakfast. This morning, I tried their mushroom omelette with goat cheese, salad, and toasted sesame bagel with cream cheese. While the vinegar salad dressing was rather unpleasant, everything else was tasty. I wish they used portobello mushrooms instead of white cremini mushrooms in their omelettes though.

Service was good too. No complaints in that department.

Overall, I like their breakfast\/brunch selection, as well as their wide selection of pastries and cookies. There's plenty of competition on this plaza with Aroma and Cafe Landwer - both great alternatives for breakfast and brunch. What a Bagel holds up to these other places quite well IMHO. I definitely recommend this What a Bagel location as a breakfast venue, but Aroma and Cafe Landwer are also great options.Went for the first time today and was pleasantly surprised! We got an iced mocha and a vanilla latte. Both were delicious with no bitterness. We also got the biggest blueberry scone I've ever seen and it was also excellent. I received very good customer service as well. We will be back! Highly recommend.The hot beef sandwich is very, very good. What keeps me coming back are the Parmesan garlic tots though. The owner is always very friendly, which can't be said for all food cart vendors. Unfortunately, he's not been on the Capitol Square for a while (moved elsewhere in the city, according to his website), so no more amazing tots for me.Wow!
Just moved here from Los Angeles, this place could put a lot places out of business!! Food looks and taste amazing, you can taste the effort and love they put into their amazing food. The quality of food here OMG!! It is GREAT!!Great. We stopped in for lunch on Monday, had the fire roasted red pepper soup, wonderful and half a panini, mozzarella with prosciutto also wonderful. Both tasted very fresh and the price can't be beat. We will be back for happy hour soon.Going on ice cream alone, this place isn't bad. The custard has a wonderful thick texture and not grainy at all. Some custards don't get so lucky. The toppings selection provides a variety of favorites but keeps you from getting wild and crazy. For a fast food treat, can't complain.
My issue is the location. I had my dog in the truck, so I drove through the drive thru and what a mistake. Two lanes are great but not when they are built for bicycles. My truck is incredibly maneuverable and has sensors everywhere but I could not get through without riding up on the curb. Hindsight, the outer lane may be more accommodating but the way the concrete barricades you, it's like driving through a car wash with tracks, you have to align it JUST right to get on the track. Since this place is not even a year old, I'm fairly disappointed. This area prides itself on the number of trucks on the road, you'd think the surrounding buildings and parking areas would be more aware of the target market vehicles. There are truck clubs in Rock Hill. Mostly teens but surely some older and they all go to Cook Out. HUGE missed opportunity for this soda shop.A really really great meal. I booked this place after reading such great reviews on Yelp and i can confirm, the food here is real good. 

This place is clearly very popular as the only table we could get was at 4.45pm on a Thursday. The atmosphere was relaxed and comfortable. It really started picking up by the time we left around 6.30pm. 

The staff are really attentive and talk you through each dish when it arrives which is a nice touch. They even made espresso martinis at our request which weren't on the menu!
 
On to the food: we shared the charcuterie board to start. The deep fried pulled pork bites were the highlight but also the dipping oil for the bread is real tasty too. 

I had the station burger for the main and it's was delightful! Super juicy and the all the flavour combined work so well.

My BF had the steak special. Whilst he enjoyed I think he had slight regret at not getting the burger. However, again all the different flavours and textures worked perfect together. 

Dessert was the highlight for me. As a Brit, naturally I had to have the London Fog. It was truly fantastic. It's a white chocolate cheesecake with these drops of an orange sauce, topped with earl grey ice cream. If you go, just have it. 

I would definitely recommend this place to any friends visiting Toronto. But book early!We ordered at this place to try it out since we don't really know much Chinese places here that deliver and with us being new to the area, we wanted to give things a shot. We ordered our food about 9 and got the receipt confirming and wanted to call when we haven't gotten our food. It's been an hour and a half and we started getting worried. I had to call 3 times for someone to even answer and when someone did, the lady over the phone said "it hasn't been an hour. It's on its way. Bye" and she hung up the phone. So never again. I wouldn't recommend to  anyone. Terrible customer service.Roy's usually is a good time with friends or family combined with great Hawaiian fusion. However, tonight was the opposite. The host started the night off with a snobby attitude and a real lack of concern for customers. 

Server Josh was nice and attentive. 

Food was from atrocious all the way to terrific. Ahi poke appetizer was not good. You can get a better poke from the $8 quick serve places that are super popular nowadays. Tuna was cut too small so it was mushy and horribly bitter cucumbers were also included. 

As always, Roy's takes care of kids with a quick appetizer and a large portion for the braised short ribs. 

One Ahi tuna entree came out properly seared while another came out completely over cooked. When sent back, the exact opposite came out where one side of the tuna was not even touched by the grill. The spices tasted uncooked and raw and they even served it with a raw carrot. Makes you feel like the chef was messing with us since we said yes first one was over cooked. 

Chocolate soufflés were of quality and taste as usual. 

Manager took care of the issues.I used to come here anytime I was in town and loved the biscuits and gravy and service was very good. Well the wife and I stopped for breakfast and were quite disappointed. First, we were sat away from everyone else. The coffee came quickly but we did not see our server and when we asked the hostess she gave a very  nonchalant ok. The food quality sucked, the biscuits and gravy were edible bit the gravy was too floury and the gravy was cold and lacked sausage. My wife ordered home fries and it was a mixture of cold and over done. The service was below par and overall I will not be back.Not at all impressed.  If you are walking around this property after clubbing in heels, the uneven tile or whatever they use is dangerous.  Signage not that great.  The room is a large suite but does not compare to the rooms at the Wynn and Ceasars Palace.  I have comps at other properties and the rooms they offer are better.  When I am upgraded to a suite at Ceasars, it blows these rooms out of the park.  Ok place to stay but there are better options.I have visited Parsley twice since moving to Spring Valley. The staff has been friendly and while the appetizers have been good, both times I have been extremely disappointed with the steak schwarma.  It is cooked on an gyro machine and the way the sheer it off, much of the meat is either overcooked or contains a great deal of fat and grissle.  The dressing used on the salad is good but as it is prepared and tossed in advance, it breaks down quickly with the lettuce losing its texture and both wilting and browning. Quality could easily improve by preparing fresh during slower periods as opposed to using what was left over from the dinner rush.  At 16 bucks for the combo with appetizer and drink, it felt quite expensive for the lack of quality and there are many alternatives. With better food preparation and attention to what is served, Parsley could certainly excel. Three stars for friendly service and good appetizers. Ok with a Groupon but at full price I will continue to explore other venues.Food was great and prices reasonable. Food was made from scratch. Server was attentive and quick. Will be going back again.Great place when it's good. Horrid place otherwise. No pool, bad music. Used to love this place. Will never go back.Wanted to see what everyone was raving about so my wife and I stopped by the new Avon location on a day when we were off and they were not packed.  The interior was nice a little more on an upscale fast food place. Burgers were quite tasty although I thought patties just a tad on thin side. I had the double  bacon cheeseburger and onion rings were cooked perfectly.
 They do have GF buns which my wife loved since she has Celiac. However her french fries were nothing special, looked like what you get from a bag at grocery store and were plain with no seasoning.. Their brand root beer is really good as root beer goes.I love their food here. They prep the food fest and the place is very clean and neat inside. The staff is very friendly and charming.Found this great restaurant when I first moved to the area and really enjoyed the food. I was there at a slow time so received excellent service.We decided to go to L'Albatros for a romantic Christmas Eve dinner and we were not disappointed. We will definitely be returning: 

I was a bit concerned when I walked in and saw how small the restaurant was. I was expecting something a bit more open. It was really the opposite. It didn't end up being a terrible problem, though, and we quickly settled into a little corner. The hostess complimented my husband on his cologne choice, which made him smile. 

The waiter was friendly and helpful and the food was DELICIOUS! Everything came out very fast, hot, and fresh. I really enjoyed everything we ordered except for maybe the chicken confit. More on that later. 

I recommend starting off with one of their classic cocktails, Ford, which was gin and citrus. So refreshing and strong, just how I like it. And then the escargot (so buttery, delicate, and flavorful). I wish I had known ahead of time that they bring fresh bread around to the tables. It would've gone perfectly with the escargot but they brought it when we had just about finished the appetizer. Is this something they typically put on the tables as soon as the guest sits down? I'll remember to ask next time. There were also little cubes of toasted bread in the buttery escargot dish itself, which was really wonderful. Like little crispy bits of surprise floating in a butter sauce. It really helped enhance the flavor and the texture. 

Next was the Onion soup, which really hit the spot. It was SO buttery and dense and, surprisingly, had little pieces of beef under the cheese and bread. I asked and found out it was, to my delight, brisket. Unusual for onion soup despite the beef stock base, but it really really worked and we enjoyed the extra flavor and texture, which ended up satisfying both of our craving for red meat, and encouraged us both to change our minds for our entree! I ended up ordering the almond crusted trout. It was silky and flavorful and the thin green beans (haricots verts) were tender and well prepared. The whole dish needed more salt, but this ended up being a good thing! I actually enjoyed that they under-salted it because I was able to use the (what I thought  was) pink salt they had available at the table, and it was very subtle, mild and added a nice smoky flavor to the dish. I would definitely recommend this dish and can't wait to try it again. 

My husband ordered the chicken confit. The flavor was there and I could definitely taste the confit aspect of the dish, but, unfortunately, it was overcooked and the chicken was a bit stringy and definitely dry. He was pretty bummed but I traded him half of my fish dish and ate the other half of the chicken confit (it really was pretty dry) and we were both content. The spätzle side that came with the chicken confit was a bit odd-tasting and mushy. I suppose it would've been better had the chicken not fallen flat.

The dessert was quite good. I went for the chocolate Napoleon and he had the pistachio cake. The Napoleon was incredibly rich and VERY sweet, and perfect for 1-2 people. The pistachio cake, while delicious, should really be served with some sort of hot beverage as it was a bit dryer (more like a bread) and less like a "cake". It was not something we would order again, but we are happy we gave it a try.

I give this restaurant an 9\/10! We will definitely be back and thanks for making our Christmas Eve so special!Met up with a friend and stopped by the Thirsty Duck on a whim. The staff are pleasant and the place has a cozy feel to it. I ordered the Donair and it was really good - I almost ordered a second one, truth be told. I would back and try the burgers - they looked good as they came out of the kitchen for others in the pub...

The prices were on par with most other pubs... Note: They only accept cash and\/or debit (no credit).Yummm Asiago pot roast sammich was yummy...  teas choices are great the club royal not melted cheese and no tomatoes... soo good..
Then icecream tooo yesss please.I would highly encourage you to find your Boba Tea elsewhere. I purchase a Groupon and the company does not abide by the limit one per person policy of Groupon. Cashier stated it is per day when it clearly said limit one per person per visit..I came with six people to treat my foreign exchange student and some fall break guests. Needless to say, I had to use my own money and my Groupon was worthless. Thankfully, Groupon has a great policy but this company does not clearly abide by the explicit letter in the "fine print". I showed her the Groupon for six trampoline visits that I also purchased same day and that company had the same "fine print". They did not have an issue with it because I wasn't trying to use all six to myself. The cashier then told me that she only has Groupon to get people in the door and make you come back multiple times. 
FYI the milk Tea was actually pretty watered down and diluted. It barely tasted of blueberry, chocolate chip cookies dough, and mango (all in different drinks). The BBs were flavorful but that is prepackaged anyway so it doesn't count. Bottom line--save your $ and visit other more authentic tasting boba shops.Ok so the drinks were good. Had the lava flow and margarita. The dip was good but greasy. Loved that it had shrimp tho. Ordered a po'boy. I asked if it had some kind of sauce and they said yes. When it came out no sauce . Just mayo on a huge piece of bread I could barely stuff in my mouth. Definitely for a mans mouth. So dry. Had to ask for thousand and just skipped eating the bread. Shrimp alone were good. The service was also good as well as the view.I love this place!  My husband and I are fans of this place and enjoy dining here quite often.  We often purchase the Groupon or Livingsocial deal to save $$, but the prices quite reasonable already (who doesn't enjoy saving money?).  Averaging about $10-13 for an entree, the portion sizes are quite adequate and worth the money.  I fell in love with Pio Pio at the Ballantyne location and was thrilled to learn they had a location a little closer in town.  I brought my husband here last year and it was his first time eating Peruvian\/Colombian food and he's been hooked ever since.  We usually dine here Sundays after church or during the week for lunch and will say that this location is smaller than the Ballantyne location.  The food is quite flavorful and the sauces add a nice touch and the servers are quite attentive and accommodating, which makes a great dining experience overall.Not a fancy place by any stretch of the imagination, and it can be a bit of a challenge to get into if you are not paying attention, as they are right at the intersection, so you need to be looking or you'll miss it.

But once you are there, they are very friendly, even for folks like us who look like we've never been there and have no clue what we are doing (which we don't). Old skool menu board, which lists their offerings, most of which are fried chicken, but they also have sandwiches (mostly fried chicken), wings and a few other options.

It seems that what you get is prepared fresh, as it takes a few minutes to come out, and then you get plenty of it - also looks like it is reasonably decent quality, as you are not getting monstrously-sized portions of chicken either, that looks like it has fallen off the hormone truck. Perhaps not farm-to-table, and they probably don't have a pen out back, being that we're talking the middle of the city here, but it's not bad. Well worth a visit.I think I just found a new favorite hang. The food is exellent and the ambiance is incredible. The music is classic (like Dylan or Neil Young) so you won't find any rap gang bangers here. Inside is very dark which I like, but if it is a nice day, they have a nice roomy patio on the North side where you can relax. Very casual yet classy. It is difficult to describe. If this is what English pubs are like then Americans could learn a thing or 2 from them.Amazing place!  Food is so good and drinks even better. Very cool place to hang out and have fun.  Mac n cheese muffins are heaven!We LOVE Tilde. It's one of our favourite neighbourhood spots for sure. At lunch they have WICKED specials, and it is possible to have a great lunch for two for $16 without tax and tip. Dinner is also very reasonably priced, and you get amazing quality for the price :) The thing that we love most about Tilde is the creative approach to Mexican food, and the incredible...and we mean INCREDIBLE....freshness. Everything from the guac and chips, to the assortment of interesting tacos, to the wings (OMG, the wings!), to the sides, is fresh, fresh, fresh. Each taco has its own spin on taste. No two dishes are the same. There is a super assortment of beers and drinks. Terrific margaritas, on special on Tuesday nights. Wine by the ounce, for $1 and ounce. The young owners are lovely, and they deserve to succeed with Tilde!The Strips were delicious and very affordable. I was not a huge fan of the Mac and Cheese but the variety of sauces makes up for it. Definitely worth trying!A group of us regularly gets together every few months to try catch up with each other and we take that chance to try out a new restaurant \/ bar. This time around someone suggested Amsterdam BrewHouse. What an absolute let-down.

First, the pros. (1) Stunning location: A  big patio along the waterfront is golden. 
(2) Nice bar: the interior is beautiful and (3) there are plenty of tv's to watch sporting events and UFC fights. (4) The beer selection: lots to choose from!

Cons. (1) The food is mediocre at best. I ordered the Nut Brown Burger and it was tasteless. Two beef patties (which wasn't outlined on the menu and is too much food anyway), swiss cheese, grainy mustard, roasted mushrooms and NO FLAVOUR. How do you do that? I was not impressed and didn't each much of it. A $15 burger dish should at least match a fast food level of flavour (I was expecting more, but the bar has been lowered). 

My friends ordered the following - Caesar Salad with Grilled Chicken (verdict = meh, I've had better) \/\/ Margherita Pizza (verdict = meh, it's alright) \/\/ Shnitzel (verdict = it's okay) \/\/ Duck Grilled Cheese (verdict = pretty good) \/\/ Scotch Eggs (verdict = tastes ok, but made poorly). All in all, a pretty pricey choice for medicore offerings.

(2) The service is lacking. We weren't asked how we enjoyed our food at all. The server dropped off the food and picked up the plates when we were done. I also waited close to 10 minutes to get condiments for my burger, and COLD burgers make the bad burgers taste even worse. My friend ordered a flight so that he could try a bunch of beers he was curious about, and when it was brought out, the server notified him that they were out of 2 of the 4 beers, so they just swapped in whatever they wanted (which were two beers he already had). Not cool. Why not tell your customers that you're out before placing the order? When I let the server know that I wasn't happy with the food and that I'd like to speak to a manager about it, she offered me his card. Really? There's no one on site to speak with customers?

(3) The pricing. You're paying for the location, not the quality of food.

I much rather post positive reviews and urge you to go places where I've had a great time, so that you too can share in that experience. Unless you eat before-hand, I'd only go here for a beer or two to take in some sun along the waterfront. It would also be a great place to take someone from out of town that's into craft beers, but seriously, eat somewhere else first. 

Thumbs and big toes down.This restaurant is about a 30-minute drive from my house, yet my family and I have a habit of coming here at least once or twice a month! All our large family dinners (30+ people) and smaller dim sum outings (5 - 10 people) take place here because the staff is friendly, food is good, and price is okay.

Dim sum on weekends get exceptionally busy, but this is one of the few dim sum places that will accept reservations on weekends so call in advance. I recommend the sesame chicken that they bring around on carts. If you see it, GET IT! It's very hard to come across again!

I've been here countless times for large dinners with all my relatives for birthdays, holidays, etc (30-50 people, 10 courses, reserved tables of 12). Service is usually good - I can't remember having to ever wait too long for the next dinner course to arrive. The desserts are exceptionally tasty!

Staff is always friendly and try their best to speak English if you don't speak Cantonese. If my family doesn't come for 2 or 3 weeks, they always ask where we've been as if it's been years! There's even a TV in the main dining area and one time they were playing Twilight hahah. The parking lot is ONE WAY! Be careful because the spots are tight and it's always packed. Just drive to the back to be safe.This is one of the few Vietnamese places in south Calgary. I mainly choose this place for convenience. Their pho is tasty enough as are the springs roles and bun. The flavour is good enough so if you're short on time, this is a decent spot for a quick bowl of pho.Cute place, friendly staff, GREAT food. Very laid back and comfortable. The Bloody Mary I got was really tasty. Pretty picky about my bloodys but this one was perfect. Id give it a 5 star rating for the area but over all a 4. I'll be going back forsure.The only thing this place has going for it is that it's open 24 hours. I don't know why I would ever come back here unless I really needed food at night - and even then, I'm sure I'd be happier with microwaveable food from Metro. 

I've been to Fran's twice for brunch\/lunch and was left disappointed both times. The food is totally mediocre (don't order the french toast here, it's just thin slices of bread soaked in syrup!), although the serving size for the linguine alfredo was pretty decent. Even if the food were mediocre, I can live with that if the service is outstanding. However, don't expect good service here - everyone I've talked to always comments about the rude and unhelpful staff. Why forgo all the great brunch spots in this city (some of which are totally affordable) to come here? 

Basically, save yourself the time & money and don't come here unless you're drunk or starving and nothing else is open.They give you free food on arrival, decently priced baked goods as well and a pretty expansive election of clothing spanning every decade from 60s to now, I prefer the vintage boutique part that sometime can be rather higher in price than I like spending, they do keep a selection under $10.00, but I find the prices creeping up to unnecessary proportions of mark-up so I end up leaving empty handed more so than usual. The store people people however range from some  being friendly to this one who is cringe-worthy to the point where they probably shouldn't be working with the public, but eh I sometimes find worthwhile items.Went to go buy hot wings and devastated that they no longer make them. I got chicken strips and potato wedges instead and unfortunately all I can taste is old oil. Couldn't taste the chicken at all. I will never come backI think I'm in the minority of people who feel that The Henry is a bit overrated. Don't get me wrong, it's fine. I've never had a terrible experience here... but I've also never had a mindblowing experience either, and have been here probably half a dozen times. I'm usually a huge fan of Fox Concepts, but this one just kind of underwhelms. Also, there's just something about the tagline "The Greatest Neighborhood Restaurant" that really grinds my gears, specifically if the neighborhood is hoity-toity Arcadia. 

With comfy leather booths, mid-mod inspired chairs, and large wooden tables, The Henry pulls off a sophisticated look without being overly pretentious. The restaurant space is huge, stretching much farther back than you'd ever imagine looking from the outside. The most recent time I was here, we were celebrating a friend's birthday so our large party was placed in the test kitchen for a little more privacy. I didn't even know this room existed, but it was awesome being back there and getting to peruse some cookbooks and magazines while dining at the massive marble counter. 

My service here has always been pretty standard, nothing to write home about. Everyone is always nice enough, but there are always little things with each server I've had--this ranges from being a little slow despite a not-too-busy restaurant, to some light confusion about fairly simple requests. Totally not a huge deal, just follows the "middle of the road" feelings I have about this restaurant. 

I've mostly been here for brunch, and have tried a handful of the menu items including the Le Pig Sandwich, the California Scramble, and the Original Egg Sandwich. Pro-tip: ask for the Original Egg Sandwich on a croissant and with havarti instead of american. It's probably my favorite breakfast entree, which is telling, considering it is a pretty basic breakfast sandwich that you could get most places for half the price. It's always good, just maybe not $11 good. I feel the exact same way about the Truffle Parmesan Fries. $11 for french fries is actually absurd.

Generally, I'll just opt for a coffee and a pastry--the saving grace of The Henry. Their coffee bar, while a smidge pricey, is excellent and has wonderful pastries as well as great espresso drinks. The fella loves that they have gluten-free options for him, and says the bundt cake is one of the better gf desserts he's ever had. I love the Brown Butter Caramel Roll, though it does feel a little bit like you're just eating diabetes. But paired with black coffee (also superb here!), it's perfect. I'm also a sucker for chocolate and almond croissants, and both are great here. 

I have no major issues with The Henry, I'll just never be the one to suggest coming here. It's pricey for the perfectly fine food that you're getting, so I guess you're largely paying for the environment. However, I am always a fan of a quick coffee and pastry stop.I wish the scale went to seven. This is my favorite restaurant worldwide. 
The food, music, atmosphere and service were firing on all eight. 

The fruit soup was amazing, like a healthy fruit gazpacho. 
The octopus appetizer almost had me out of body. 

Try the spicy spaghetti lobster was like nothing I've ever had, but have been looking for my whole life. 

I drink a lot of espresso all over the place but this was the best I've ever tasted. 

Service was perfect. Great crowd, cool lights and bar

Very busy, even late at night. Call ahead. 

If in Montreal, go there!Love love love!  Best food in Phoenix.  Must have the Nutella strawberry crepe with vanilla ice cream... house salad really great and meatball sandwich with fresh bread.Ewwww! My bf and I came here based on the yelp reviews but omg are you kidding me which Korean bbq restaurant serves boiled meat for barbecue? The boiled meat are so rubbery and tasteless! You can't even tell if they serve you fresh meat because everything it's all cooked! It's pointless to cook it on the grill again.
The pictures on the menu are misleading because they show all raw meat. We only ordered 1 round and couldn't finish it because it is so nastyActually I'm giving "Zero" stars! You're forced to give one!

So, I'm about to check into MGM Grand for the first time and is very excited to be there. I just love Las Vegas! Well, the lady who was standing in front of us was called up to the desk to register a complaint about bugs and or roaches in her bed. I heard her asking for another room  and the employee couldn't seem to make a decision. The desk employee called their supervisor "Katherine" over to handle the situation, and Katherine was so rude and nasty to the young lady. I'd never seen anything like it before in any time I've checked into a Vegas hotel! So, me and my wife saw and heard what was going on with how Katherine treated this lady and couldn't accommodate her with another room, we left. We didn't want to go up to our room and be forced to sleep with bugs and roaches. We checked into a nearby hotel that resembled a pyramid and had a much better experience with our check-in and room. So glad we witnessed that at MGM. Katherine should be ashamed of herself.

But hey, if you like bed bugs and roaches in your expensive stay and rude unaccommodating service by a supervisor, then MGM is the place for you because they have plenty of it!We are loyal Tonio's Pizza fans. Whenever I visit my parents we get pizza from Tonio's and it is excellent. We think it's the best pizza in Medina County and we're of Sicilian descent, so we are picky. 

We recommend the sausage topping on the pizza. And the calzones are the best. 

Highly recommended.Excellent food in a pleasant environment. While we couldn't finish the dessert it wasn't for lack of desire. The first bite of the warm bread pudding caused instant ecstasy as did each subsequent bite. Found myself staring at the bowl just wishing for more stomach room.The head chef came out and talked with us about our meal \/ the area and what he could do to get the word out (maybe he was the owner too?) and it impressed me so much I had to add my review from urban spoon to yelp. 

Anyway the review: 

Amazing. Out of all the Thai places in pittsburgh, this place hits the spot. It has no MSG and you can tell all of it is fresh. The staff is so nice and willing to bend over backwards to accommodate you in every way possible. When I went there, I tried the drunken noodles and the spicy Thai rice (as those are the dishes I've had at most of the Thai places in pittsburgh) and both were streets ahead of my expectations. The deserts are fantastic and not what you would expect on a Thai menu (in the best way possible). In an area and city where Asian food dominates, this place is by far my favorite and I will be coming back week after week as long as they can keep up the quick, personal service and amazing food. 10\/10Excellent Indian (well, technically Pakistani) restaurant. Everything was very fresh and well prepared. The spice level was just right. The place was packed with people from India, thus, you can rest assure that the food is authentic. Just typing this is making me hungry. Think I will go back for more...

Get the grill combo!

Update: am impressed with their vegitarian dishes. had the green peas and paneer curry, two thumbs up!The restaurant is really dirty. The plate, bowl, and fork are not clean. The Oysters are not fresh, kind of frustrated because it is an oysters bar. The service is not good. Feel likes no one is serving us.sushiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii! 

So I've come here a couple times and so far I've had a really good experience. The first time I sat at the bar and we ordered a couple rolls and some drinks. My favorite roll was the baja. It's a little spicy but so yummy. It's a spicy crab roll with a tomato salsa on top. My go to is always avocado roll. It's just simple and good and makes me happy. I've also tried the AAA box roll. It had good ingredients but when picking it up it would fall completely apart. Not so much fun. We had a couple other rolls the first time I went but nothing that stuck out at me. I went a second time with a group of friends. We grab a table and ordered our favorites to share. My friend Paris and Sam do this cute weird thing where they eat their first and last piece together... AWWW!! But that is besides the point. Paris ordered a spicy tuna crunch roll and a lotus on fire. Both were amazing. She even ate the flower. I'm a huge fan of crunch so anything with tempura crumbs is a win. My friend Theresa ordered her favorite. She got the dragon roll. It came out and I was in such awe I forgot to take a picture. It looked just like a dragon!! It also tasted like chicken. Very good. The most talked about was the Kabuki roll. Sam ordered this and had it mostly to her self, however I did try one of the orange egg looking things.. It was weird. Not my thing. My baja roll for this trip came out last and I though it would be a good idea to just stuff my face. I however did not chew the roll all the way and almost died. I had to step outside and spit out the roll before I choked. The pieces I ate after that we chew thoroughly. Kabuki has been good to me so far (aside from almost dying). Paris ended our meal by eating the flower from my bay breeze. What a crazy gal.Food is generic. I fell like I am eating at Ponderosa or Home Town Buffett but with free booze.  I tried everything on the menu and the only thing zi liked were the steaks made to order. Everything else was bland, and didn't hit my flavor palette.This place made us feel like we were eating on Top Chef or one of those shows. Everything was perfect, and delicious. Attention to detail was fantastic. We've been to a lot of places, and this place was something special. Best meal we had in Vegas.We opted for a Saturday night dinner and a movie at the Arizona Center and decided to visit My Big Fat Greek Restaurant.

It was remarkably uncrowded for 7pm on a Saturday (Why is it that no one goes to the Arizona Center?).  We were seated right away.  We skipped the patio because, um, it's June in Arizona, and were taken to a 1\/2 table 1\/2 both towards the back.  

We cracked up at the drinks.  Maybe they are generous, or maybe they get tired of refilling, but the glasses were at least 32 ounce.  This was good, but not what we'd expect from this type of restaurant. 

I'm going to say that the food was good but not terrific.  It should be noted that I wouldn't even know what Greek food is and I ordered the Italian Chicken Parm because when it comes to food, I live on the whatever-is-opposite-of-wild side.

The server was personable and prompt.  The food came out in a reasonable amount of time...so truly no complaints here!I absolutely adored this place!!!! My fiancé and I visited after stumbling across it on our trip to Vegas this past weekend. Literally breaks my heart that there is only one location and it's 3000 miles away. I had the sopes - queso version with the chorizo. Oh my goodness it was so perfect!!! First time I've ever told a waiter "this is amazing" --- so so perfect!Hit this Paradise for lunch with a friend- it is conveniently located for both of us. I don't  go to Paradise often, but when I do I order the same thing, half a club and salad. I had heard the mac and cheese was super delish so I gave it a try. 

I have never had a bad experience with the food (again I order the same thing every time so take that into consideration).  The mac and cheese was pretty tasty and the bread and meat are always fresh. 

The lack of a full five stars is due solely to the fact that every time I am in a Paradise I seem to become stupid all the sudden- lol.  I never know where to go to order or who is giving me what and then pay who and which line?  Not a big deal but seems to change each time.  I think they are trying to figure out the best plan for dealing with the big lunch crowd :\/   Not a deal breaker and almost more comical on my end.  Our food did arrive at the table- took a bit longer than I expected- but tasted great!  If we could do half stars I would say 4 1\/2Oh my! I absolutely LOVE this place! Thanks to a fellow yelper, I made sure i had lunch here and I'm glad I did! Everything is so fresh and delicious. Oh!! ANDDDDD they have the BEST espresso I've ever tasted.(This is coming from a coffee addict....fyi)

Service is top notch and it's not crazy expensive. I have officially found my "usual lunch spot" in Vegas!Stopped in today and tried the American Burger and "Just Fries".  The wait time for a couple of burgers far exceeded our expectation, which a Manager responded to promptly. The burgers and fries were Ok, nothing spectacular given the Gordon Ramsey theme. 

Since our meal was a flop, the manager covered our meal and solicited feedback from us on where they missed the mark with us. This restaurant appears to have a very keen management staff, I just hope they can translate customer feedback into a better product.What happened to Roy's?? Their butterfish used to be to die for and now it's a defrosted slice of mush. The edamame comes from a freezer bag. Even the salmon which is a normally a no-fail standby ended up tasting disappointing. The service was so slow. If it takes you that long to take my drink order and then to bring my drink order there is no way the evening is going to get back on track. Nope. The dessert cake even came out burned. Ugh. I can't believe we paid money for this.Found this place on yelp as a breakfast spot between Vegas and a day trip to the Hoover Dam. Absolutely worth the short detour from the highway. We were greeted immediately with menus and waited no time for our friendly server to take our drink orders. 
It was a quiet Wednesday morning, but the chef still seemed to be very busy, as there were quite a few takeout orders for employees of the Ford dealer next door. 
I ordered the pancakes which were huge and so very filling. My husband ordered the veggie skillet which was so delicious and a large portion. 
It feels like a step back into the 60s with the awesome theme and decor of the restaurant, and is made better by the friendly service and delicious food!I like this subway more than some of the others in the area. It's a Subway! They can speak English...Great spot for sushi and my group had a ton of fun drinking saki as well. Enjoyed it from day one and I'll continue to go back.Got there about 5:00 p.m. on a Sunday, No waiting for seating and they were very fast on taking the order. The waiter checked-in on us during the dinner to make sure we were fine (Food, Drinks, Ect.) and then we got the check in a timely matter. Great place if you have a young one!!Very trendy and comfortable cafe located in the Princeton Club. You can enter from inside the Princeton Club or the exterior of the building. It's more expensive than I expected but everything appears to be fresh and healthy! I'd probably only go back if I was in a time crunch.I love this restaurant! The food is amazing & more importantly the customer service is excellent. I was especially impressed with bartender\/assistant manager John. I visit Hula's often for food to pick up as I live across the street & John is always extremely friendly & professional. If I ever do encounter a problem with the food, John always resolves the issue. I would not only recommend this restaurant to anyone, but I would especially recommend that Hula's leadership consider putting John in some form of managerial role, as he is one of the main reasons I continually return.On the outskirts of historic downtown Glendale in the midst of taco stands and Mexican bread shops seemingly on every corner, lies this great little Italian restaurant.  My wife and I have found a hidden gem!  The service was great, the food was excellent, and the ambiance was relaxing.  Both of us had house specials.  My wife had the lobster ravioli and I had the lobster fra diavalo. Both dishes were superb!  You must save room for dessert however, because the tiramisu is out of this world good!!   Our server told us it is made in house and the chef spends a lot of time making it. It was very light and creamy and not too sweet. With a dearth of mom and pop Italian restaurants in Glendale we will definitely be coming back to this place and highly recommend it to all of you Yelpers!!I rarely get anything I don't like and I must say the meatballs are amazing and the ranch is great. Once I received some over cooked fingers but we are always pretty pleased with everything we have had.Good place for biscuits and gravy. The portions are huge and taste great. Everything else is nice,  but I live for their biscuits and gravy.Very good pho! Best I have had here in town. Mia our waitress was very informative and helpful.  Will be going back more oftenThis is on par with the best BBQ in Phoenix. The wait is ridiculous, since you could easily drive elsewhere in the time you wait to be served. We saw the line one day and skipped it but came back the following day 20 min. prior to opening. Wait time was over 1 hour from opening time. At least 75% of the customers are visitors drawn in by the great Yelp reviews.
Remember - it's Phoenix, it's near the airport and tire shops, the line is outside, the dining is outside, the food is hot. It's not like it's worth the wait to catch breathtaking views.
They offer to-go orders the day ahead which you can jump the line and get at opening time. That is the only way to go, in my opinion.
At least the food was delicious. There is never a reason to rush the art of BBQ, but since it's been smoking all night it should be ready to move. I'm sure they can find a way to cut & weigh it fresh while still getting it to their happy customers more quickly. They are opening a 2nd location, which speaks to the popularity of their craft.
The owners could be billionaires if they got local repeat customers, which unfortunately I'm not.I was in the area of Rainbow and Spring Mountain ( at Walmart ) around lunch time.  Noticed a sign for Mr. Sandwich with another sign saying buy 3 Banh Mi Sammies, get one free .. .sold!  Not sure when this place opened but they are still putting up signage in the interior of the restaurant.  Also not sure if they replaced another restaurant at this location.

all the sammies are $3.50.  I went with the grilled pork, grilled chicken, grilled beef and house special sammies.

Fairly standard banh mi fillings, decent sized but the bread somewhat average.  The stand out was the grilled pork - probably twice the meat than what i get at Dakao but i give Dakao the nod as to the bread and meat flavor.  Still, i'll give Mr. Sandwich a little slack since they are just opening.  Curious if the buy 3 get one free  deal will be around for awhile.  I believe they also had a pho special, too ( maybe BOGO ) - while waiting for my order i noticed someone else ordering the Pho - about all i noticed was the soup bowl was the size of a mixing bowl - very large !

I'll probably return 

pics attachedGreat location to shop & then have lunch.  Good food and great sangria!  Fun environment to meet up with your girlfriends!Cool concept, but its not cheap, It's also not fast food.

My buger dog and fries all were tasty, and I now get what all the fuss is about.

Well cooked bugers decently dressed and the split dogs are fantastic. I do like the buns and realize why they are remarkable

Ok ok am a fan!I love this Vietnamese restaurant!  It's our go to spot!  It's a very friendly family that runs it.  I recommend the Sirloin Pho, the Grilled Pork Bun, or the Cornish hen.  Fantastic choices!  Of course you have to get the spring rolls with the peanut sauce.  We have been to the majority of the Vietnamese restaurants in the Phoenix Valley.  This place is at the top of the list.  I'll be surprised if you don't like it.Free tea if you ask for it !! gentle service, standart dishes, crunchy fried ice cream for desert mmmmmm . Just a few tables so come early.Honestly, if I could give this restaurant 0 stars, I would.  My family and I were ready and excited to go to a hand-pulled noodle house in Chinatown, but were running on the later side and wanted to make sure we'd make it to a show. So, walking past Basilic, we figured that would be a quick option. We went in, were seated at a still-dirty table that was being cleaned around us, and quickly ordered our food, politely letting the server know that we were a little bit short on time. Side note: don't ask the servers for advice on the food they serve, because chances are they won't have tried it or will be unwilling to help. 
We waited for about 35 minutes after ordering and then asked our server if she had an idea when our food would be coming out; "we have a show to make," we reminded her.  She shook her head and laughed at us demeaningly and stated that if we were in such a rush we might as well cancel our meal.  At that point I was pretty frustrated. It was a casual restaurant that we had stopped at more for the fact that it looked like it would be quick than anything else. I told our server that I was pretty disappointed as we had been told this would not take long and that at this point we didn't have time to cancel and go anywhere else for dinner. I told her that if she couldn't guarantee that our food would be out in the next 10 minutes I would like to speak to someone in the kitchen. She walked away, and nobody ever came out to talk to us. 10 minutes later, she came out letting us know that they were out of rice so we should probably go somewhere else. Seriously? An Asian restaurant out of rice? It sounded fairly improbable. We left extremely frustrated and went to our show hungry. They didn't even offer us anything for the extreme inconvenience they had caused us.The place is somewhat hidden inside a village. It seems like it is more of a family restaurant.

Garlic bread was served and it was salty and the garlic flavoring was overpowering.   Calamari for apettizer was not even enticing. Bland and the marinara dip was lacking in flavor, too.
 
And came the entree. I made a mistake of ordering the shrimp marinara because it was the same sauce that came with the calamari. But how could i have known, we order the apettizer the same time with the entree. It was lacking that fresh italian herb and spices flavor. Although it was sprinkled with dried parsley and oregano on top. And it came with a ton of pasta! The chicken marsala was the only thing that tasted nice. 

I was disappointed, to say the least. It was out-of-the-freezer and out-of-the-can taste. I might as well reheat my Ragu.Whatever you do - get the "thai".

You have to do it.  You will see what I mean when you take this leap of faith.  It will change your life forever.

Happy eating and * I will see you there * - well at least before me and hubby goes back to Vancouver =D.Love smash burger!! Such yummy food! I go here all of the time and have to say I get the best service especially from Meghan! She is so sweet and efficient even when it is really busy she takes the time to ask me if I need anything and knows my regular order, the delicious chicken sandwich! She is great!!Burger King has had its up and downs the past decade but recently I have enjoyed the value menu for a late night meal. Also any where with surge is a okay in my book.I'd recommend this place to anyone. Food is as good as places you would find in any chinatown and I've visited many. Maybe its because stuff taste better after you've lost all your money but I always look forward to eating here when I'm at the Palace Station.My girlfriend likes it and she doesn't even like chinese food. But be forewarned, this is an authentic chinese restaurant so don't expect nice uniforms or even english speaking employees. I once seen a guy, must have been the cook, walk out the back and sit at one of the tables workin a toothpick in his mouth. WTF!?!? Like I say, its a chinese restaurant. You go here for the food and that's all.Becoming one of my favorite AYCE sushi spots! Their interior gives you a more metropolitan-y\/fusion type feel. They offer the usual favorites when it comes to rolls and appetizers. Nigiri ratio to rice ratio is decent. I don't think I've ever seen a full bar at a typical AYCE sushi restaurant AND this place offers those fishbowl drinks (with happy hour pricing) so it's great for groups! Ate here with my family before they flew off to Europe and we really enjoyed a fishbowl to share! Loved it so much my bf & I took our friends from out of town here less than two weeks later. But the best part is they're offering $20 AYCE lunch AND dinner price since they've newly opened! Definitely something to take advantage of before it's gone!I've only had the frozen hot chocolate but hey..........hey......HEY!  It was beyond remarkable.  I thought about sharing it but decided to pig out with my very own.  Only drawback here was long lines and it took a long time to fill the orders.Great food great vibes and AMAZING customer service thank you for lunch  i had the half ribs Mac and cheese with bacon wrapped shrimp and spinach artichoke dip my son had the pizza off the kids menu and it was a nice size and not anything small. My food was delicious !!Fried rice---10\/10 (smoky taste was awesome!)
Salmon in teriyaki sauce----8\/10 ( the server kept on suggesting to get it with coconut because it was way better but my mom insisted on teriyaki)
Pumpkin curry mild spice----- 10\/10 (its curry with lots of vegetables, be ready to eat more rice!)
Silver noodle soup-----9\/10 ( a little more seasoning this would have been a 10)
Orange chicken-----7\/10 ( the chicken was good, citrus flavor qas definitely there but not orangy)
Coconut Ice cream----8\/10 ( the taste is there, its just that i tasted something way better before especially that fresh coconut part. For people not used to fresh coconut, this is an easy 10)

The place was so relaxing and quiet. Perfect after a long drive under the sun. We were there early at 6pm thursday with 2 other groups... So i dont know how it looks during busy times if they have one.Great for lunch! Good prices for great quality and authentic Hawaiian food. Super chill vibe and great service. 

Had the Kailua pork and cabbage and ahi poke as an 808 mixed plate. Tried firecracker chicken (not spicy at all) and short ribs (delicious sauce!). Very filling and enough food for two meals.I just love the food here, I am always impressed. I love the small hole in the wall (clean) family feel. The service is amazing, the food is ALWAYS fresh, and he Saki variety is really good! It's just all around good, but don't pay the outrageous delivery cost ($20) save yourself the money; and just pick-up!good bulalo. Pancit canton a little salty. The inihaw pusit was not that good. Great Wall decor of old Manila and historic photos.This is my favorite place in the whole wide world! The food is amazing and it's a fun place to hang out. I really am not sure what I did before they opened!!! If you haven't been yet you are seriously missing out!Had a seating at 11 a.m. on Sunday for brunch, the first seating time available. Items like the egg bake didn't come out to the hot buffet area till around 11:40, the pork sausages on the sign never came out at all. Several times had to ask the fellow tending to the cold buffet to replenish items which were out. When dish with mashed potatoes were brought out late, they were cold. Previously visited during weekday lunch and dinner and never experienced same deficiencies in service and restocking of buffet tables. Manager may have been consumed with watching an especially noisy bar patron who had to be escorted out by police, to pay attention to the details of the food experience.Really great service, crepes were amazing! The décor was spectacular as well, felt like I was in the coziest place for crepes and coffeeDecided to check this place out and see what all the rave was about for their custom breakfast biscuits. I ordered a fried chicken biscuit with avacado spread i loved the fried chicken the biscuit itself was ok i was expecting it to be more like a down down south cooked in your grandmas kitchen type of biscuit. Overall everything was good,no complaints. The guy at the register was a hoot and kept me laughing when he asked what would i like to drink i replied OJ for orange juice and he replied one bronco coming up hey i love the juice man! Nice touch having the box inside to ask how they are doing ! I hear they have great donoughts i have to stop by one day just to grab one,in the inside there is a picture of a guy eating a giagantic donought too funny!One star is one too many. We will never go back. Our greeting was not, "Welcome to Billy's." Instead, these out-of-towners were told, "Show us four valid North Carolina IDs." No smile, no friendliness. Just an incredibly rude greeting. I can't imagine service any worse than this anywhere.A not so hidden gem in Downtown Phoenix.  BC Signature French toast was perfectly prepared with candied nuts and fresh fruit.  Also, shared the Border Bowl with my wife.  Chorizo, bacon, ham, sausage, green peppers jalapeños, pork green chile and crispy hash browns topped with 3 eggs over easy.  Heavenly and bountiful with flavor.  Coffee was good, server - Nicholas was best in class.  Just don't see all of this in one place that often.  Highly recommend, be prepared to wait on the weekends.  It is worth it!We like coming here for lunch. Kinda hidden away in the Venetian so never gets too crowded for lunch on a weekday.  Great patio seating overlooking the courtyard.  I recommend the french toast...best french toast hands down!My review I sent to corporate and never heard back

To Whom It May Concern:
I have tried to use your contact form on your website, but 400 characters is not enough, and no one ever responded back to me when I did try to submit a complaint.  I normally don't complain but I have 3 different issues that happened at this location and to be honest it is getting tiring.
Issue #1
About a month ago I went to the drive through and ordered a 3-plate meal with Teriyaki chicken.  When I got to the window the girl asked me if I wanted any sauce. I said yes Teriyaki sauce and I was informed it would be a 15-minute wait if I wanted sauce. So why was I not told that when I placed my order.  Dry Teriyaki chicken for dinner. Yummy, I wasn't waiting another 15 minutes after 10 minutes in the drive through.
Issue # 2
My husband and I go back for dinner a week ago and we order. When we get to pay I was wondering if they had a tray to put all our food on.  Fernando who was working the register points down the line and says yeah, they are back there.  Very helpful.
Issue # 3
Yet again we love Panda, so we order online today.  I ordered a Teriyaki Bowl with white rice, a 3-entrée plate with orange chicken and Teriyaki chicken x 2, and another 3-entrée plate with orange chicken and Teriyaki chicken x 2, a chicken eggroll and cream cheese Rangoon.  It said our order would be ready at 4pm so we drove over and gave our name.  When we got there the order was not ready, so she starts to make the order. Here I will say the girl who made the order was very nice.  While she is making the orders, she tells us it is going to be a 15-minute wait for the teriyaki chicken.  I told her we placed the order 20 minutes ago and we are not waiting another 15 minutes.  She asks what else we would like so we then pick Honey Sesame chicken.  As she gets the order together she then tells me they do not have enough honey sesame chicken, and asks what else I would like. Strike 2. I asked for 2 chicken egg rolls instead.  As she is packing up the order she drops the chicken egg rolls on the floor and informs me they have not dropped any new eggrolls and it would be another 8 minutes.  Strike 3 on this order.  Now we must pick something else and the choices are limited because my husband only eats certain things on your menu.  So, we end up getting more orange chicken.  The whole order was a complete mess. 
As you can see we are loyal customers but at this point I am discouraged from ordering form your establishment again.Have been coming here for over a year. The service is amazing, the food is to die for, and you always feel important here! Beat location with parking! Highly recommend. The owners are very personable to the clients which is huge!Best India food ever had in Canada it tastes like the real DHABA in India.
Love this PlaceFettuccine DE Scalopinos - awesome!

Meat lasagna - awesome!

Great service and good atmosphere!Pretty good waffles I like that you can choose your toppings and your waffle batter. It was moderately busy when I went and our drink order came when we were nearly done eating. 
Food is served on throw away plates and the forks are plastic.I will go to Monta Chaya probably every time I go to Vegas from now on.

A ton of interesting dishes as well as some good strong staple dishes.  We got the cold noodles without meat (delicious), the mustard greens fried rice (awesome), and a salad that I honestly can't remember right now.  

All the ramen dishes around us looked great and since this place is open pretty late (11pm) it was pretty packed at night.Solid Indian buffet place. Good variety of meat and non-meat dishes. Everything tastes freshly made. Staff is... What you normally expect at Indian restaurant.These burgers are juicy, cooked to perfection and melt in your mouth. Burgers never tasted better & service was amazing!Seriously you guys cry about wanting $15 an hour but you can't take a simple ass order my kids are allergic to mustard and I clearly said no unions no mustard and get it's all over this damm burger. If u can't understand English get out of fast food and go do phone order where no one understands your ass. 


Will never be back 

What a way to treat your combat veterans 

A+ if you want your order all messed up!!!!!!!


$15 hour what a joke you fools don't deserve even $8 all you do is flip burgers and drop frys that's on a timer you guys work so hard for your $$$$$$$$$$

Sincerely, 

Never returning customer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!This is the best Indian restaurant I've ever been to!  I've tried quite a few of their many vegetarian items, but always come back to the palak paneer and veggie pakora to start.  I'm typically not a fan of buffets, but Maharani keeps it very fresh.  The servers have always been very friendly to me, and I love the fact that the dining room is so quiet.  Also, there is actually a difference between mild spice, medium spicy, and hot spicy, which hasn't always been my experience at other restaurants.We ordered 2 large pizzas for delivery. 
Neither one of the pizzas were cut through. 
They put way too much cheese on the pizzas. 
All of the cheese slid off of both of the pizzas. 

It's amateur hour over there. They don't know how to make a pizza. 
They don't know how to cut a pizza and they don't know how to deliver a pizza. Other than that, they are ok. NOT!!!

I highly recommend, for you to NOT use this place!!!If you are from the Boston area or know anything about the Bostonian favorite foods - you need to try this place. We got a table in 15 minutes! Pretty good for New Years weekend in Vegas. Eric was an awesome server and suggested his favorites menu option and pointed out Donnie's and Mark's favorites. You'll feel like part of the Wahlberg family. The Walh-sauce was awesome one the tarot tots. Enjoy!!The sushi was fresh and delicious . I didn't care for the hibachi last time I was here but the sushi was excellent at this visit.   Chirasi was great and the sushi chef made it look beautiful! Spicy tuna hand roll was good too!Best Mexican chain in the area. If you get a salad, it's huge portions like 2 meals in one. They don't charge extra for guacamole like Chipotle does. The sweet pork is nice.I used to like eating lunch here until the day 2 cockroaches crawled on me. In the middle of the day. It was months ago and I still feel a chill down my spine when I drive by.Mother's day lunch was great. Good food, pleasant service and great atmosphere. It was loud but the place was busy with families so it was understandable. Another good experience. I'm looking forward to out next meal there.My visit was awesome. I went on a Saturday afternoon and immediately got seated after 15 minutes of waiting. 

I went with my friend and we ordered:
-A glass of white wine
-Frozen Bellini
-Zani ziti
-Alfredo's artichoke lasagna 
-Chocolate chip pazookie

All of it was awesome. The white wine was sweet. The Bellini was strong and sweet. It was really delicious! The lasagna was bomb! I was nervous about trying a white lasagna but I was very satisfied because I prefer white sauce pastas anyways. The part that made me most nervous was the artichokes. It was a good compliment. It gave it a tart flavor. The pasta wasn't mushy. It was al denté! Yay! The pazookie was magical. I'm pretty sure I had an outer body experience. 

The price was extremely reasonable for the quality of food that we had. We paid approximately $45 for all of that food. 

The are a few things I would suggest. Tidy up the bathrooms because they weren't clean. The layout of the restaurant is awkward. Why is the bar so small? Why is there a spot at the bar where you stare at the wall? That's no fun! It's small in this restaurant too.

Overall I think I'd come back. I like the food. :)

EL FIN!Like this Rubio's, it's kind of on a lake\/man made pond so the view when eating outside is nice. 

Love their steak and fish taco meals. They have a salsa bar too, which is a plus in my book! Service was really fast for my to go order and the lady even brought it to me without calling my number.They had a Monday special of fish and chips for around $7 which i couldn't say no to.  The fish was huge which was great because it also became my lunch the next day.  It tasted good.  The batter wasn't heavy or too greasy.  There were lots of fries too, but they did not taste fresh.  Service was pretty fast and impersonal... kind of reminding me of McDonald cashiers.Great food and great service.  I especially like the shishtawook and chicken shawarma rolled pitas.I really liked the place....What sucked me in first was the beautiful white interior....then I saw the fish, which is too many in one tank....

Our waitress was reallly awsome! She was sooper friendly and joked around with us. The food was really, really good....I got a noodle bowl and a side of fried rice and the noodles were great and the fried rice was a new and wonderful take on fried rice....it wasn't the homoganized fried riced that is doused in soy sauce it was white in colour with a lot of fresh veggies....yum....

Yes our tab was a little higher it was about $43.00 but heck we are in the hotel and unless you go to a disgusting buffet you are going to expect to pay more. My friend I I split a appitizer, I had a noodle bowl, fried rice and even though I generaally don't drink a glass of wine. 

I would go back agin next time I am there.I want to start this by saying that our waitress and bartender were great. That being said, the manager needs an attitude adjustment. We were a large party (14) promised the upstairs dining room but upon arrival we were told another party had the room. ( I had called 2 weeks in advanced and called a week before to double check we had the room so we could decorate) We were moved twice and told about how annoying it was to move us and made the overall experience horrible from the start. Dinner was okay...salvaged the beginning of the night. Upon paying the bill our coupons were not accepted even though our waitress did try to help us out, we ended up paying way more for the meal than we should have. We had a living social coupon and another person in our group had a groupon...one coupon per table no matter if your check is separate.(would have been good to know)  Overall, disappointing and a waste of money.I really enjoy going to Subway after a workout.  Most of the staff is always very nice.  There is one staff member that is extremely pleasant and remembers my order.  I have some "creature of habit" tendancies and love to have my meals prepared the same.  Including my quick stops for a turkey on wheat with fixings from Subway.  The food is always fresh....even if I go late in the evening.  Thank you Subway for being convenient!  And special thanks to the outstanding staff!!Loved this location! The inside and outside seating is abundant. The vegan menu is perfect also the fact that they have soy milk for coffee is exceptional! My first visit I got the Vegan French toast and it was delicious. Give this location a shot especially since there is free parking.Went to Blue Ribbon at the cosmopolitan for valentines weekend. The service was great but the food was not up to par. I've eaten at Blue Ribbon in Brooklyn, New York for a work event and it was much better there. My boyfriend and I ordered two specialty items to share: 

The king crab fried rice: had barely any hint of truffles as shown in the posted pictures. There were large chunks of shiitake mushrooms which were unappetizing. Basically way over priced and over hyped for this dish

The Blue Ribbon lobster sushi maki roll: the lobster was hard, cold, and chewy. The emphasis was that there was caviar on the roll, but it did not make the dish any better. 

I usually like to order signature dishes for what the restaurant is known for and I don't mind paying high prices for great food, but this was definitely a flop. I don't recommend these two dishes here.In one of those ridiculous desert rainstorms, we walked\/ran down the block from our hotel to Fate, where we whiled away the rest of the storm drinking tasty beer and eating pizza bread.

The presentation of the beer menu is a tease here, as they list off all the beers they brew, leaving you salivating, before you realize that only three of them are currently available.  On our visit, two were IPAs, which seemed redundant with such a small selection.  Then I realized they had a couple of other beers which were not on the menu (5 or 6 total, plus some "guest" beers from other breweries) and I felt less confined.  All the beers we had were very good, and not weak.  They give you stats (alcohol content, IBUs, etc) to help you pick.  I could see coming back every so often just to check out what's new on tap.

We also had pizza bread, which was basically a medium cheese pizza.  It was exactly what the mid-afternoon happy hour called for.  Speaking of happy hour, we had four beers and that pizza for $18, which is kind of a ridiculous deal.  

I love checking out local breweries when I'm visiting a city, and this place exemplifies why.Ok, it's a Chinese restaurant in a Las Vegas hotel so I was pretty sure it wasn't going to be particularly authentic. Actually check that, there's a Chinese place in the Palace Station hotel that really is quite good. 

Anyway, dinner started off well enough when they brought out fried wonton strips and sweet and sour (I'm a sucker for fried wonton skins!). We shared the wonton soup, yang chow fried rice and crispy garlic chicken. The fried rice was really bland and the crispy garlic chicken had an overly sweet sauce that could easily have been orange chicken, general tso's chicken or any other goopy sugar sauce covered chicken. The wonton soup was the best dish of the night with lots of meat, veggies and huge meatball sized wontons.

Service was alright, but it seemed like a pretty slow Monday night. Prices are in the $10-$15 range for most dishes, which is not as bad as I was expecting for a hotel restaurant. I'd probably head across the street to PF Chang's before I come back here.I just had Dairy queen tonight for Dinner not what you expect when you go to a Dairy queen for food Yes on the Blizzards, Ice cream cones, u name it. Let me first start off with the entrance. Trash every where in plain view of the customer eye sight, Yes the dining room is clean and comfy depending on the type of day and how well the staff keeps up with the cleaning. 

  second thing If you order food its not what you expect its like someone spent all night from 9pm or when ever they close until when ever cooking these patties at home and bringing in to work and not cooking them on site like McDonalds or Wendy's. 

  The Female manager\/owner of this location is rude and not friendly at all. They judge people based on the service we customers give them. One thing I find interesting is they just randomly going up to customers and telling them to not return. 

  So if you have a Problem with your service and business don't bother letting this Dairy queen location know because they wont do anything about it. One thing I notice when I ordered a Blizzard to go even though I had a coupon for a 1 off large Blizzard the staff gave me a small Blizzard not what the coupon said and they ripped me off.Poor service completely ruins this restaurant. We brought a guest from out of town to Marche and we were treated so badly I won't be back. We went in for Sunday brunch, the place was almost empty, not a good first sign. We were seated at a table in the sun so we asked to move...that was our big mistake. We moved to a table on the upper patio and we were basically ignored from that point on. We had to flag down the waitress to get water and again to place our order. The drinks took a good 10-15 minutes to arrive, thats not an exaggeration. For a wine shop you would think they would know the difference between champagne and vouvray, but apparently not. So, after waiting they got the drinks incorrect. Had to flag down the waitress and correct the order, this took another 10 minutes. We were on the verge of leaving when a different person showed up at our table to be our waiter. He wasn't much better. The food was so-so, consistent with other reviews for this place. I'm not sure why they keep getting 4 star ratings. Must be the location. As a local who entertains visitors all the time, I was embarrassed by the service and food. Sad. Like I said in the beginning, I won't be back.Lots of different options, love that they also have the Ramen place connected as wellThis place reminds me so much of all the Hungarian Places that used to be along Bloor in the Annex--the strange decor, the menu with the liquor listed at the end, the staff and the way the place fills up at a drop of a hat. Save for Country Style, they are all gone now. Fortunately Euorpe is here.

Took the kids here last time. They loved it. Appetizer Debriziners, Langos, the cucumber salad, paprikas, schnitzel, the noodles. All simple, good stuff. The only thing that was disappointing was the Dobos Torte. Go to a bakery for that, I guess.When I goto a new restaurant, I would walk around to spy on what other tables have on their tables. I also love to watch customers' reaction as they eat. As usual, when I arrived at Fishman Lobster Clubhouse for the first time, I did my rounds. My observation: Everyone was pleasantly enjoying the food, no one was talking to each other as they were just concentrating on their food. Main attraction on every table were: The mountain king crabs and the mountain lobsters.

The king crabs and lobsters are definitely the main attraction here at Fishman Lobster Clubhouse. The way they plate the king crab and lobster is an art in itself. It felt like stacking for a game of jenga. We had the deep fried with pepper and salt for both the king crabs and lobsters. We loved it. The fried garlic is definitely the ingredient for the success of this dish (I wish they serve congee here. The fried garlic would go so well with the congee).

Don't let this seafood place fool you. Their non-seafood dishes were just as good. The sweet and sour pork: definitely one of the best I've ever had.  I also can't kept my chopsticks away from the lobster roe fried rice and chicken with ginger and scallion. 

Oyster with salty egg sauce: I loved the idea of the rich and creamy taste of the salty egg sauce. It was very good.  But the oyster was too rubbery because it was overcooked.

Coming here wasn't just having a good meal, It was a dining experience.  Food is no doubt exceptional but I don't think I could come here all the time...at least not for another round of lobsters and crabs. Maybe I am just saying that because I OD on lobsters and crabs!The chicken rice dish was good. Chicken marinated just right. Unfortunately the Wait time is very long for only 3 people in the entire restaurant. They promoted checkin to receive free appetizer.... they set the minimum purchase of $20. Deceiving if u ask me since majority of lunch items are average price of $8. Needless to say i didnt get to try it to comment but poor business practice.I've been going to Market Grille for a few years now so I don't know why I haven't written a review yet.  The one on Lake Mead is now closest to me and great for stopping in for either a quick bite or to grab a to-go box.  They have great salads, gyros, fries, and the pumpkin soup is one of my favorites.  If you have room the pumpkin baklava cheesecake is really good but rich.  If you want something sweet but a little lighter the rice pudding is always spot on.

I also like that they offer gluten free, a vegetarian, and vegan dishes so that just about anyone can find something great.  Now that they're doing a happy hour, I may need to stop in more often.  Oh! Make sure to check in and you'll get a coupon.  I'll just save mine until next time which shouldn't be too long.Where do I start?? This place is great. The service is responsible and friendly, the ambience is great, and the sushi is decadently delectable. Some of my favorite things to order there are the Hooter's Special, Chad special,  Yum yum handroll,Princess Deana, and Bam Bam special, but you cant really go wrong with anything on their sushi menu. I Love Sushi used to be my fave, then I tried Spicy Tuna and haven't looked back. Also, if you eat here often, the staff will start to recognize you each time you come in. Whenever I walk in, they all cheer "Sammy, Sammy!" Do yourself a favor, and try Spicy Tuna. You certainly won't regret it.Tried to come in here with my friends to spend $$$. Apparently my friends' dresses weren't puritanical enough in Las Vegas? Mary is a total prude, avoid this place if you expect a Vegas atmosphere...Ok...This may not be fair. My wife and I went here for breakfast.  This place is probably not known for its breakfast but if you advertise it then at least do something right. The service was lacking to say the least. The table was dirty. My coffee cup was dirty and disgusting.  My wife's pineapple juice was watered down and not even close to tasting like it should. The coffee tasted like burnt mop water. Perhaps the dinner or evening atmosphere is better. I don't know. The food was simply ok but not good enough to redeem the other issues. We have all been to dives where the food can make up for a bad experience. Not here. 

As a note the manager was apologetic and took the beverages off or bill and also applied a discount with being asked for that extra step.This place is small was really clean. The service was amazing and the server was quick to order. We ordered summer rolls with shrimp and it is freshly made.  The Pho noodle soup was amazing and the Thai curry was perfect! Its only one mile from our home so we are definitely coming back here.We have been here over a dozen times and every time the food is spot on. The filet mignon is always delicious and perfectly cooked! would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great steak not to mention the desserts are divine also!!!Excellent Pizza! The White Pie was a major hit. It was $28 for the large pie (one size). Additional toppings are $3 each. 
It was ricotta and mozzarella with lots of garlic. My girlfriend and I only waited about 20 minutes for a fresh one made to order, took it back up to our room and slammed a whole one to ourselves. It was killer. Best part of the joint is its open til 4AM so it beats any hunger or post clubbing, gambling or drinking all night long. It's a "secretive" location but with the reviews and reputation of this place, it is def no secret!I've tried all the other location and usually I will order the spicy pepper fish soup with vermicelli and century eggs. You can select two toppings. I like the snacks and will order the fish tofu and the Chinese red sausage. 

The broth was good and noodles came in a good portion. However the red sausage had a little too much honey in it. Overall the noodles was nice and the hot honey ribena tasted good aswell.Best grilled corn on cob ever!  It has some kind of miso and butter. Great hand rolls. Garlic edamame was too spivey for me, but hubby liked it.Definitely a gem, maybe not so hidden anymore, but it's location makes it feel as such nonetheless. I've been a couple times now and it never disappoints. The Wilderness fries are a staple, and I recommend getting one of the four options to anyone. 

The beer selection is diverse enough that you should be covered no matter the style you enjoy most. My girlfriend and I don't care for IPA's much, but unlike like other breweries the quality doesn't fall off for non-IPA's. The Simply Sorachi is my go to. It is ultra smooth, not too hoppy for my liking, while still holding a great flavor. 

The one downside is the lack of TVs for anyone looking to go and watch a sporting event. I went last night to watch a game and to my dismay I forgot there are only two TVs up at the bar. The other two, even larger TVs, are reserved for a scenic slideshow. When asked if those could be changed, I was told they are just for the slideshow. That being said our server was super friendly and made it a point to periodically check if any seats opened up at the bar for us to move.

Give this brewery a shot, it won't disappoint.How is it possible that a restaurant can keep exceeding my expectations every time?

We went with a huge group on Saturday night and it was fab! I love that the hosts at the door are always very happy to see you. 

The food is delicious!! The menu  has their the old Gio's favourites like the huge meatball (that my friend Jane dreams about) the grilled calamari (that I dream out). The specials are usually planned and thought out, oh and delicious!! 

The servers are after my own heart: not snobby, very attentive, knowledgeable and take demanding foodie friends in stride. Water always full or decanter on the table - check, side plates for appetizers - check, new cutlery after the appetizer - check!

It might be worth noting that they have expanded the restaurant. There used to be an Autoshop next door that they now use for large parties. I was loud and fun! 

**the only time that you will pay 'through the nose' is if you don't watch how many bottle of wine are flying around**My favorite tacos! Lots of choices at a pretty decent price. Wait staff are always friendly and open to answering questions about specials and menu items. My only complaint is that the music tends to be on the overly loud side.Reasonably priced small Italian in very busy neighbourhood.

Wait was short on a Wednesday night (8PM), table for 4.  Staff were attentive, friendly without being too intrusive.

Nice wine list , and reasonable by the glass selection.

Food was good and certainly worth coming back for a second try.Awesome place to eat AYCE Sushi! The place is nicely decorated, clean, and plays great music. We got seated right away. Super fast service! There's 5 sushi chefs on a Saturday lunch service and 6 service staff. I can't believe we go to Seafood City (across the street) and never came here! Only negative is one dessert per person but other than that, it was a great experience. We will definitely be recommending to everyone we know.This place is really great! It reminds me of the European cafes I miss so much! Highly recommend the ham and cheese croissant; its so tasty, we ended up buying some to go for later! Fast, friendly service.We have been here about three times and each time we are pleased with our visit. We were lucky enough that each time we got a table right away. We always ordered the basic broth and it comes with a lot of items to add plus the noodles. It's a good size because I was full at the end. Price is also very reasonable.Stephanie, Priscilla and Halle were great! Enjoyed the chicken fried chicken. Definitely recommend!First off I will say it was OK.  Maybe my expectations were too high.  I have spent a considerable amount of time in Fukuoka and love Hakata Ramen. So when I heard about Tampopo I was very excited and had no problem driving across town to give it a try.  I actually had the opportunity to try three different types Tonkotsu, spicy miso and their ultra spicy.  The soup is relatively weak.  Hakata ramen is Pork based rich with flavor, but theirs needed more flavor.  There is an option to order the "rich" soup, so don't expect it to be flavorful with the basic (I didn't try the rich).  Additionally I was expecting benishoga (pickled ginger) and takana (pickled mustard greens). An other topping that needed help was the char siu (roast pork).  the pork was cut too thick and was extremely fatty.  The little bit of meat was tasty though.  I was not a fan of their ultra spicy ramen.  The spice level was right, but they mixed spices with the noodles making them pink.  I think it would be better with standard noodle in the spicy soup.  The spicy soup made up for the lack of flavor.

Service was lacking, but understandable since it is a new restaurant.  Because of this my rating just refers to the food.  When we arrived we were greeted by three different people and asked if we were ready in the first 5 min.  That was the highlight of the service.  The waitress brought the wrong order.  I don't believe in wasting food so I told her it was alright and started eating.  Fifteen minutes later another lady brought the correct order.  When we finally finished our meal it was 20 minutes before we got the check.  

I will probably wait a while before giving Tampopo another try.Did Uber eats. I got the 3 mini tacos plate with beans and rice. No fork or spoon and no salsa made it hard to enjoy. Good thing at least I had hot sauce at work.  Will try again.We were craving sushi and love trying new fusion foods, so we found Soho right around the corner from work. I was a little skeptical, but it was SO GOOD. Got the 3amigos and the Sunny Salmon. Both were delicious, but the Sunny Salmon was a better first-time burrito. 3amigos is good for wasabi lovers! Definitely want to come back!I thought to give this place a try since I was in the plaza. Boy am I WRONG!! They missed our orders and didn't apologized in a language I didn't really understand. The potato noodle is so awful and chewy like eating tree branches. I wish I asked for refund, but just didn't give any tips for their poor service.Excellent place for takeout. I recommend the Tempering Spicy Chicken - an intriguing combination of flavors, with just a thin coating and a hint of spice. Note that it doesn't automatically come with rice, and I couldn't figure out how to order a side of rice on the app. Maybe I'm just dense.My family & I came for lunch and had an awesome meal. After having the guac & chips, I had the el pastor , short rib( not my favorite)  and steak tacos. The el pastor and steak tacos were extremely flavorful & filling. We washed it all down with a pitcher of pineapple margarita; amazing ! Not too sweet and not too bitter. Thanks Bakersfield for showing this NY girl a different side of Cleveland dining"Bridging multicultural fusion: Begin with food and go beyond..." touts (one of) their website(s), but really, you can end with food too.  Why?  It's just that good.  Any place which can make my lips literally buzz from the spices in mapo doufu is a winner in my book, even if they don't "go beyond" like some Buzz Lightyear wannabe.This may actually be the worst novelty hotel in Las Vegas. When I was growing up I always dreamed about staying here with the sideways elevators and slanted windows, but after booking a single night here to go the gun show the next day, I'm glad I'm only coming to Vegas to buy some ammo and not staying for the weekend. The check in process is horrible. After 5 hours on the road, a nice 45 minute wait greeted me in the form of a line at hotel registration.  Throughout the night I can hear the hotel's announcement system asking people to move their cars, literally their saying the make and model and license plate and I can hear every word in my room.  The rooms are ancient and lack necessities people come to expect now. Some USB ports at the desk and night stands, a refrigerator or mini bar, a quieter AC. I suppose such luxuries are only afforded to those willing to pay more further up the strip. Which leads to another point. This location is terrible. It's at the southern end of the strip and nobody every goes down there now. Certainly is a nice walk to where all the action, no thanks to the tram which conveniently doesn't stop at the Luxor.I have enjoyed Durant's 30 years.....I took some friends for a birthday lunch November 19th..my caesar salad had sooo much mayonnaise it tasted like it was drenched in it. One of my friend ordered crab cakes...she got ONE small crab cake($26.75)...ridiculous. This was the most disappointing birthday meal ever:( The only saving grace were the chocolate brownie dessert and the cheesecake(those was excellent).Food is great, I recommend the Golden Nites Pilsner beer because the name sells its self when you are here. Great happy hour selections and the atmosphere is awesome as well, enjoy the skate arena while having a few drinks and the staff is Awesome as wellThe Rio has always been a staple of each of my Las Vegas visits, mainly for the Seafood Buffet. This trip was a bit different as we actually booked our room here. The room itself was pretty decent. The view was terrible, overlooking the trash area and the roof. The first day we were here, the wind was blowing and you could here it blowing through the old seals of the windows. This place can use some TLC. New window seals,  fresh window tint since the current tint is peeling and cracking, and the hallways really need some new lampshades. One of the hallway lights was missing a lampshade altogether, and the rest looked terrible with holes or just being out of shape. The curtains on the windows were really wrinkled. Even with all of that, the room was pretty good. I like the size, bed was decent, water pressure was great in the shower, but I could hear the people in the room next door fairly clearly. I would probably stay here again, but I would need a room with a better view.Am in town for a short getaway-- and came across this place when looking at a place that would be close to my hotel on a rainy night--- and was NOT disappointed - this place was INCREDIBLE-  it felt like a touch of Barcelona (patatas bravas)- blended with a twist of Montreal-  and a dash of home!  As someone who is surrounded by great restaurants at home in NYC - I don't generally make a resie twice at one place on vacation- this is the kind of place that merits a second visit !Perfect price point for what you get. Really like the "big bites," especially the bacon ramen. The draft selections are usually wonderful as well, but be prepared to be flexible if you're a hop head.I opened up a Yelp account today to write two reviews, and this is one of them.

Check out the reviews on blogto.com (mine the 1st), and you'll see the glowing reviews thus far!

King's Tacos took over another Mexican joint about 3 months or so ago.  The latter seemed only to be in business for a year or so - it was OK, but my wife and I went just once - obviously not good enough to bring us back.

But I'm here today to talk about King's Tacos - the sign says "since 1983" and I thought that was strange as I had never heard of them.  I checked google to no avail, so I asked the owner the first time I went there.

It is a chain in fact, but they have 4 restaurants in Chihuahua province in Mexico - this being their first Canadian operation.... good initial sign!

The restaurant itself is casual, not somewhere that you'd sit for 2 hours - I don't even think they are liquor licensed (maybe I'm wrong), but people come here for the food!

I can attest that I live somewhat close so I pass this place 2 or 3 times a week.  To start, I used to see a steady 3 tables of patrons there, and then 5 or 6, now its full.  Not lineup full like some of the "popular" spots in Toronto, but by all accounts should be!  The tables are frequented by mostly Latinos which is another good sign!

I've been to many of the "popular spots around town, for example: El Asador (If I would write a review it'd be 3 or 3.5 out of 5)  El Trompo (similar), Grand Electric (4 stars) - No this isn't the "authentic" taco that everyone has been looking for - but they do taste good nonetheless, and the drinks are a bonus.

Now, on to the food at King's Tacos - in 3 trips, Ya vas (mixed meat) do-it-yourself tacos, La carnitas (pulled pork), enchiladas, quesadillas are among some of the items purchased.  I personal favour the tacos dishes that I've tried, but that is just a relative thing as I think all are good, tasty, authentic, and very generous portions.  I've had to bring home food every time I've been.  Also, the amount of REAL nachos that they give you (like a 1\/2 bag of Tositos in quantity) with 3 excellent salsas for free is amazing, the guacamole is pretty good as well (I am partial to my wife's though!)

All in all, this will be a spot I can see myself going for a quick bite once a month or so - well done King's Tacos!  Looking forward to sampling some other dishes.......This is probably the worst chinese food we have ever eaten. We ordered veg noodles at first they added meat and we sent it back. looks like they microwaved some preackaged noodles and brought them to us. Part of them were cold and sticky. 
Goto the food court and eat the food instead of wasting money in this place. My only star is for the waiter, he was nice and courteous.Spicy as hell . Those noodles have authentic peppers in them so be prepared. I believe every entree is made with them. I had the veggie dumplings and they were good. From what I was told they are the most popular selling ones.Local gem.

New menu with lots of fresh options. 
Love the fact that most fish is wild or organic. 

Considered a local gem for most in ththe area. 

One of the best patios in the area as well.I generally eat at the blind pig  3 times a week and have had good lunches except for  11\/2\/2015.
I came in for lunch feeling normal and found myself as sick as a dog after eating a turkey
burger. I will call it food poisoning. I called  the establishment to let them know and asked for the manager, his answer was that he was not in. I asked for a  supervisor, he wasn't there either.
I left my name and number and know has called back . Evidently know one cares or is concerned. I'm sure the Clark County Heath district  will take it seriously   .Even though it is a chain, i like it a lot especially for the below items: 

- White Moka
- Big Terrasse
- Free WifiStaff are very friendly and willing to adjust to meet your requests.  Food is very good.  Small loaf of heated bread is a plus.  A daily lunch and dinner board displays the specials.   They usually have Walleye Pike that is worth a trip.  I would give this restaurant four plus stars.super nice hotel & marquee is the place to be BUT DON'T EVER PUT YOUR CAR IN VALET!

i came all the way from la on a busy friday night to join friends who were already staying at the hotel and put my car in valet. gave my room number and the bell boy bought our bags to the room shortly after. come sunday we check out and i wait 20 mins for my car from the valet. i inquired why and they let me know that my car key was broken. WTF!! i specifically gave them my room number when we checked the car in and NO ONE informed us of a broken key during my first time stay at the hotel. my car comes and they tape my key back together and start my car.  

who the hell drives from LA to vegas with a broken car key with 3 other people in their car? where is the logic in that? yeah i would LOVE to be stranded on the desert while waiting for AAA. 

i submitted an incident report and went to the nearest gas station to get gas, i turn off the car to pump gas and when i try to start the key again the car wouldn't start and i was stranded at the gas station for 30 mins trying to get AAA to come with a key to start my car. 

luckily i made it home ok and never made a stop during the trip because we just wanted to go home after the bullshit ordeal. 

to make matters worse, their risk management and insurance provider were of NO help at all. and i didn't get ANYTHING for the inconvenience and time lost during the trip while dealing with their negligence and carelessness with their guests' belongings. especially forms of transportation. 

- horrible customer service
- totally ruined my first time experience and i will never stay here again
- i really LOVED this place until this happened -_______-Ordered the calzone it was very tasty.  The beers were ice cold.  Not a bad place to go and watch a game.Love the original french toast here. Great menu with lots of unique healthy items. My new fav. for breakfast in old town scottsdale.Was working in the rain and decided a pho would make me feel better. Sloppy service, really small portions, especially stingy with meat. I hate it when the noodle\/meat quantity is so disproportional to the broth and bowl that it looks like it was already  half eaten.. Broth flavour was just mild and tasteless..  If I weren't all wet from the rain and starving it would have been a 1\/5 :PEnjoyed dinner last night at Hubee D's and really enjoyed it! Ordered the grilled boneless wing basket...Cornbread was great, as well as the wings, coleslaw and fries. Luckily we left room for desert....Frozen Banana Pudding Pop did not disappoint, it is necessary for every meal. Do not skip it! 
Customer service was top notch last night by all staff members. Will definitely return very soon!!The food was okay (the patty tasted okay but was dry as hell), but the staff experience was abysmal. The guy at the register spoke barely above a whisper and I couldn't hear a thing he was saying, nor did he seem to be able to understand me when I was asking how much certain things cost and he kept entering the wrong items into the register. He may have been a trainee, which is tolerable and understandable, yet I still couldn't hear anything he was saying.

Still, I was polite and courteous.

The ice king of a supervisor(?) stepped in to take my order in frustration, entered the wrong things (left over from the previous guy?), and I asked why a plain kid's burger and a plain cheeseburger and a side of bacon were $17.60, thinking something was ordered wrong or that combos were entered by mistake. He walked away and said that it had already been ordered if wanted to know the prices I could check the receipt on my own. Wow.

For the record, I did check the receipt once I got to the table and, yes, both items were entered incorrectly--similar to what I ordered, but more expensive versions (i.e. a child's plain burger with a side of bacon was entered as a more expensive Western Bacon burger; a plain cheeseburger was entered as a more expensive 1\/2 lb Original).

I just didn't have the energy to deal with resolving this or turning this into a thing right there. I just wanted to eat and go home.

There was also a large pile of swept-up garbage sitting in the middle of the floor, unattended to, which was unappealing to have to eat next to since half the seating area was blocked off with paper signs and chairs and there was nowhere to eat except next to the garbage pile.

Never having been to a Carl's Jr., I was curious to try it but now I'm mostly irritated at myself for not walking out when I first started ordering. The experience in this location was a huge turn-off that tainted any enjoyment I had from the (expensive) food.Wonderful food. The Sultani Kebob and Half Chicken are consistently very good. Service and times not the most crisp. Go for the food.Food is good, ambience is great! But limited options for vegetarians. My husband and I were here for dinner, and it was quite busy, attributable to the long weekend. 

The restaurant has a very welcoming feel, and waiters are very courteous and alert. The fresh bread with butter, onions and basil reached our table even b4 we placed our order! Very happy with the service!!!

We ordered a Veg Appetizer Plate with hummus, pickles, salad, dolmeh and yoghurt dip. The dip was fantastic and hummus was great, salad and dolmeh was good. The pickled veggies were not to our liking. For maincourse, we had the only other veg option ... Veg Kabab with rice. This was good.

I would like to see more veg options on the menu to make this restaurant a regular. Good job Persian Room! Looking forward to more variety ....This Popeyes USED to be one of my favorite places to grab a quick bite.  The chicken was dry.  I ordered red beans and rice and got mashed potatoes.  My iced tea tasted old and oh, they didn't even bother to give me a spoon for the potatoes.  The girl at the drive thru window was rude and practically tossed the bag to me.  Never again.  There are newer Popeyes in better areas that still serve the chicken, biscuits and red beans and rice I love!It's a pretty good place, but it doesn't compare to my favorite thai spot.  We ordered a lot of dishes so we could all share.  The pad Thai was a little too red and sweet, it was as if it had sweet and sour sauce.  The cashew chicken was ok, not my favorite.  We also had a beef dish and a shrimp dish plus the combo appetizer platter and edamame.  Yes we ordered way too much for 4 people.  The cocktails were super weak, overall, it is ok.I use Yelp a lot to find places to eat. My son suggested El Bravo because of reviews. Lots of good reviews.
My wife and I  got there and was seated by a very nice lady.  I am going "good start". I may of just hit it on an off night. Nothing special about the decoration. Kind of plain could of used some cleaning. Very typical of some of the locally owned places where you can often get some very good food. My son and daughter arrives and it takes a while for someone to come and take our order. We get our drinks and wait and wait. Other people that came in after us have their food and are eating. Our drinks are empty and I have to ask to get refills. Ten min. later our waitress came out and said our food was being made. Ten min later we finally had our food. My son liked the Chimi, my wife and daughter liked their meal. Nothing exceptional, good. I got their cheese crisp Ole, again was good. There was not a lot of people in the restaurant so our long wait was not because they were to busy. I will probably not go back. There are a lot of places that do as well or much better closer to where I live.My girlfriends and I stayed at Planet Hollywood recently and dined at Spice Market Buffet for our first meal in Vegas. 

AMBIANCE: When you see the bright sparkly sign, you are expecting something high end but once you take the escalator down to the dining area, it looks a little drab. Clean and spacious though...

SERVICE: My friend misunderstood the prices that were posted on their website because she missed the part about the price going up in February and it was February first that day. The lady at the cashier was absolutely RUDE and would not even listen to my friends explanation, as calm and nice as she tried to be. The service at the table was great though with our water always being refilled and plates taken away in a timely manner.

FOOD: Great selection with food from different cuisines: italian, chinese, mexican, middle eastern, and seafood. The buffet selection was great as well with cotton candy and TONS of cupcake flavours. We loved that there was a huge selection of cupcakes but many of them were actually dry. 

PRICE: It was $25 per person for their lunch buffetI took my first trip to Raising Cane's on Memorial Day! First the the young lady Kendall provided excellent customer service from a polite introduction to great service for all my needs. Second the quality of the food was great and was visibly hot and fresh. Overall I give my experience a 10\/10 and recommend Raising Cane's not only for the great food but great service!Great place to come hang out especially with groups of friends and family. This place has great deals seven days a week and go to happy hour. My personal favorite 
"dollar beers" on MondaysFound this place thanks to yep once again. Great food. Best vegetarian food ever. You won't be disappointed. You have to try the chicken wings they are the best. I just want to know how they make them. My daughter in-law had the sliders. She said they were delicious. I had the thai curry vegetable bowl. The flavors are unbelievable. We need more restaurants like this so we can eat healthy. I'm from central California and wish we had a place like this there.My boyfriend made a reservation a couple weeks in advance for our anniversary there. Waiting for quite some time was worth it. We had a cellar room downstairs which was absolutely gorgeous, and created a very romantic atmosphere. They have a great selection of wines to satisfy even the biggest wine snob. 
We ordered 5 cheeses formaggi platter, which was even though on the pricey side, was absolutely delicious. 
As a main course I ordered 45 Day Dry-Aged Ontario Ribeye, which is always served medium rare, closer to the rare side, and is perfectly made. Juicy, flavourful, and well complimented by arugula salad. 
Their Sticky Toffee Pudding is also worth trying.  
Go out and try it for yourself =)What a fun place. I really enjoyed the experience. I am not sure I was that crazy about the food but that was through no faulty of the restaurant. I ordered a veg dish and a crepe type of french naming Empanada thing. Sorry forgot the name. It was stuffed with carrots and other veggies. ( that dish, by the way, was awesomely delish.) 

My veggies were overcooked and a little slimy but it still tasted okay. Since I am not a veggie maybe it should have come that way. I just can't eat the soy or fake meat so I did not order any of those types of dishes. I have to admit their menu is extensive with tons of choices. 

I guess I will have to go back for the Hawaiian burger, I see. I almost ordered that.  Everyone on here is saying it is delish. 

The server\/owner??She is a Dearheart for sure. 4 stars from me. Three for the food. I would go back.My husband and I visit Vegas once a year and we always have dinner at Old Homestead Steakhouse. The food is amazing!! Every bite is perfectly flavored! We highly recommend this place! Our server RITO F had the best customer service!!Disappointed. At the start, they would not seat me with my two small children because my wife was a step behind. The restaurant was half empty! I asked them to just seat us in a table for three. He would not do it. After insisting, he called the manager over, who relented and let us get a table. On to the food.  The blueberry pancakes for the kids have no blueberries in them! What?!? There is blueberry syrup. The chocolate pancakes have no chocolate in them! Some chips are sprinkled on top. The French toast was just not good. Ok, maybe I should not have ordered French toast at a pancake house, but if you have it on the menu, do it right. Then when leaving, discovered it is cash only (hello tax scam). I got money from the ATM and paid for the $28.00 meal. While I am getting my son's coat on, he sets my change on the counter and goes over to talk with a customer. He gave me two singles and a ten. So, sadly, I only tipped the waitress $2, rather then fight again with the host to get more change. Just give me enough change to tip 20%; you saw the bill, you saw I got cash from the ATM. We will not be back and recommend you go elsewhere as well.such a cute and relaxing atmosphere. great coffee, lovely and attentive staff and a unique presence. #DrinkTogetherMy wife and I love this place. A bit out of our budget to go as much as we want. 

The artichoke is a must when you can get it. Not sure how it's prepared, but it is amazing. Be adventurous and try the tomato gin soup. I can explain exactly how delicious this is, just trust me ( you have to be 21 to order it).  Great Salads, steaks, and seafood. 

I am not a dessert person, but I do like a bite or two of my wife's favorite desert....white chocolate brownie with ice cream.This place popped up, taking over from where the Mr.Sub was. I was kind of iffy about it like I am with all Asian resturants I try for the first time but we ordered pick up. 
We ordered a bunch of stuff and everything was amazing quality and the food was a really good portion. I ordered extra's(some resturants don't like that) but Asian express was very accomadating. The black pepper beef was something that I will definatly order again. It is spicy but not overwhelming like some other places. The coconut rice is a must as well. I didn't eat a single thing that I wouldn't order again. 
The customer service is so nice. The recipt that was stapled to my bag is actually readable and the girl at the counter went over it for me when i showed up and was very attentive. And the price is really reasonable for the quality and amount of food. 

Im going to be a regular customer!Just tried this place for the super bowl and the appetizer combination platter was great! Everything was home made and tasted incredible. The pizza was great too!One word: AMAZING!

I never had such yummy food in my entire life, i just wish they would open a bigger place so people can dine in.For Sacred Hogan:
- Open on Black Friday (NOT A HOLIDAY) when Fry Bread House is closed
- HUGE portions. Even being quite gluttonous, I was not able to eat even 2\/3 of it
- Hot sauce is less hot and more flavorful, allowing me to use a ton :)
- Service was friendly and quick

Against Sacred Hogan:
- Shasta soda. Seriously...is Coke that much more expensive?  It just makes you look SUPER cheap
- Fry bread seemed under cooked. I'm used to eating it much crispier, and this was just really soft.
- Didn't love the beans..and when ordering the Pima (beans plus the other toppings, no meat), that's a problemI'm glad I read the reviews here that made me choose to come. We had dinner here our first night and breakfast before we left. Both meals were outstanding. Huge portions and good quality. Short wait and nice atmosphere. Only change I would make would be to do their buffet breakfast instead of a la cart. Our meals were amazing but we were in a rush to catch our flight.Came here for a company Christmas Party.. The food was plentiful but my steak lacked flavor. This is my second trip here and I haven't been overly impressed. All of our food was served cold, our waiter wasn't attentive overall this wasn't a great experience for us. Better luck next year when we return.I have visited One Restaurant many times and it has never disappointed. The food is fabulous and the service is equally as amazing as the five-star hotel that it is connected too (the Hazelton). The patio is definitely one of the best in the city when the weather is nice, but the decor of the interior of the restaurant is both classy and trendy. Sooooooofabooooosh!
The best restaurant in Toronto!!!I ordered the chef nuit pad thai with chicken and also the gaeng kiaw wan in a coconut for dinner; both were wonderful dishes.

Chef nuit paid thai chicken - both the chicken and noodles were cooked and flavoured really well - the only improvement I would make is that there was too much chicken compared to the noodles (which is a rare thing for a restaurant to have more meat to noodle ratio). It felt like it was almost a chicken dish instead of a pad thai dish. Nevertheless, it was a delicious dish.

Gaeng kiaw wan in a coconut - the dish was pretty cool in that it comes in a coconut. The curry was very creamy with flavours of coconut and basil; I highly recommend this dish. Again, the curry to rice ratio was a bit off (there was too much curry compared to rice). However, it's much better to have too much curry than too little.

Overall, the dishes were delicious, and I highly recommend them for your next visit!Great place to stay. Rooms are very clean and affordable. Middle of the strip is a great location.Best hog dogs in Montreal!

The sausage is so juicy and the poutine is loaded with gravy. The decor is modern and cool. 

Must try the signature cabane hot dog with maple syrup. Every time I go there the staff is friendly and the service is awesome. 

Late hours in the summer time make this place quite convenient for evening snacks after drinking at the surrounding bars in the neighborhood. Please try it when your craving a good hot dog!!!!The signature of this place is their spicy boiled fish which was actually really good and comes with generous portion. 
We also tried their dry pot mushroom dish, surprised by how good it tasted. I'd definitely recommend these two for now. Will go back to try other dishes soon.

Location wise it is located in a basement. Generally quiet in the restaurant. If you are looking for somewhere romantic or scenic, this won't be the place for you.

Food: 4.5\/5, service:4\/5, ambient:2\/5All you can eat sushi for awesome prices!!
Very friendly staff and fast service. 
I enjoy every bite. Just moved here 2 weeks ago and already been 3 times!I enjoy places that provide a great value for the money spent on food. This goes back to how much I did not enjoy paying for going out to eat in California, because it is always so expensive. I originally heard about this Hawaiian restaurant from a Teriyaki Hawaiian Restaurant owner \/ chef friend from California. He had stayed at the California hotel, which is where this place is located, and decided to act on his recommendation. Good thing I did! I have been eating here for over a year and they only have raised prices once to an acceptable level. I always get the flash combo bowl chicken no skin & beef on a mound of sticky white rice. I then order a small saimin, which is huge, if I'm still hungry or if I want to share it. Two things that could make this restaurant a home run, accept credit & debit cards & have a healthy brown rice upgrade option. They promptly close, so be on time!Had breakfast at the Harvard Inn Family Restaurant on Saturday.  The service was quick.  The food is cheap (eggs, grits and turkey) under $4.  And, the atmosphere pleasant.  My buddy loved it!  I will go back again.Got the worse food poisoning of my life here! Seriously thought I was gonna die!Food is ok. The shenanigans and horse play is what happens when you let kids run a business. Been there a few times, seen a manager being pushed around while in an empty cardboard box. Tonight, tall skinny kid slapping the arms of a girl coworker who was making our pizza. We asked for a larger cup because we bought a bai drink and wanted to drink it to go. Was told they have to charge me $2.50. After i just spent $30 they want to charge me for an empty cup. So, there are a lot of these places opening in the area. Will stay with Midici and Fired Pie from now on. Same type of food, with adults running it.Love this place. Location is clean, food is great. Gluten-free options make it extra appealing for my family.
Don't compare it to In-n-Out, they're both great in their own way. I'm excited to have a Shake Shack in Las Vegas!I haven't eaten at every joint in Pittsburgh, but I'm convinced that Homewood is the center of Pittsburgh's barbeque world. There's the Dream BBQ, and the Showcase, so close to each other you could do a rib-off and the sides wouldn't have time to get cold. Both are good places to eat, but the Showcase edges into greatness with ribs I found slightly more tender, greens that are fantastically smoky and good, and a Hot as Hell sauce that lives up to its name and is actually quite addictive. Vegetarians, if you get dragged here, it's worth noting that the sides are prepared without pork (according to the menu), so you have some delicious options.  

Having eaten at both, my choice of Showcase or Dream might actually depend on the mood I'm in, the kind of sauce I want - but if I had guests and wanted to feed them really, really impressive ribs, I'd head over to the Showcase.Didn't have pay to get in, which was a good start to the event.  Got here around 7 and figured I would stay till about 10.   Lots of diverse food choices at reasonable prices.   Probably about 40 choices or so with dessert options too.  Funnel cakes, ice cream, and fancy hydrogen ice cream things.  

Most items between $5-$10 which was cool.   Music quality was perfect.   Specious and 75 degree weather helped.I've eaten here since there soft opening, I've celebrated birthdays here, had work meetings here, and even visited to take the edge off after a hard and long day. This is essentially the quintessential Vegas gem, proving that even though food on the strip is amazing, you clearly pay an arguably unreasonable premium for location on the strip. The steaks are all amazing, I stick to the hanger with horseradish sauce, but the rib-eye cap is worth a try. The wild mushroom soup here is delicious, it tastes of the forest infused with grandma's love! The arugula steak salad, diver scallops and drunken goat are great non-steak options. As for apps and sides, I suggest the bone marrow Asada, portobello fries, and octopus. Old menu items that no longer exist on the menu were there absolutely divine and cheaply priced squid ink seafood pasta and hanger steak sandwich (I implore them to bring these back after a few years of absence). 

As for the steaks, they are really amazing here. The quality of the meat itself is what makes the restaurant stand out. The flavors and skill added to preparation are impeccable. I only note that Medium Rare here is more like Rare, so go up one temperature level from your usual when ordering here. 

The drinks here are also top notch. I forgot his name, but there's a wonderful bartender here on Tuesday nights. He can whip literally anything you throw at him. Plus, the cocktail program has been great here for a very long time. The cocktails are well designed, well-poured, and well-priced. 

The only thing I wished this spot had was a developed steakhouse dessert menu with classics like Baked Alaska and Bananas Foster. Maybe that's for the future?Had the Open Faced Hot Roast Beef.  Nice tender tasty and juicy!  I also ordered the Vegetable Soup and Minced Pork perogies to go.  It was good but the vegetable broth had Cauliflower in it and was Cauliflower white which kind of grosses me out.  Cleanliness and service was 5 star!  Oh yeah and the perogies were awesome!!!Well deserved high rating!

More craft beer selection (porters, stouts)Love love love Marcos pizza!! Was so happy to hear that they were opening a location near my house. This is my go to pizza, hands down! The ingredients are fresh and staff is always friendly. I ordered 2 pizzas for Super Bowl and they had my order ready promptly in 30 mins as they had told me. Everyone loved the pizzas as there were a few who were unfamiliar with Marcos but after trying it, have become huge fans. Keep makin' those mouth watering pizzas!Great late night dinners good Vietnamese food, love their pho soups :)Dole whip used to be a treat I could only enjoy at Disneyland's Tiki room attraction. Now I can satisfy my craving now that we have one in Vegas! 

My favorite is the dole whip float. It's a great-tasting  healthy alternative to ice cream and free of the top 8 food allergens! My daughter has several food allergies and I love taking her there since it's the closest thing to ice cream she can have. She absolutely loves Dole whip! 

Kudos to the manager and staff, they are always so friendly and upbeat.I stopped in here with a friend while in Las Vegas in early December. We actually tried to go to the Wicked Spoon buffet, but it had just shut down to flip over to dinner, so we wound up at Holsteins, starving to death!

I had the steak salad, which is interesting due to it being made with radicchio lettuce, which is a little bit more sour than you would normally expect to see. 

The service was pretty fast and the waitress was extraordinarily accommodating regarding my order for quadruple steak on my salad.  

The environment is a little noisy but not in a bad way. It's just busy and that's kind of the vibe of the place, very upbeat. Having been in enough spots in casinos that are like crypts, this was a welcome change. 

It's a little pricey but that's Vegas for you...the quality is high enough that you shouldn't be concerned about it.

Honestly I wish now that I had had the fully monty, ordering up a shake and a hamburger. I'll definitely be back here again. And this time I'm ordering a burger!Great, complex broth in the soups and the dumpling nags are outta this world.  The spicy beef noodle soup comes molten hot and has a nice bit of spice.Good value, so-so shawarma.  There are better shawarma places 5 minutes further south on Yonge street.I really love this place and I think their baked goods are delicious. 
My favorite is Cookies&Cream cake - so delicate, melts in your mouth...the texture and flavor are both perfect! I
I love their assorted cookies as well: they are baked fresh each day, have a nice crumbly texture and I am very pleased with the flavors. They use a good-quality dipping chocolate, not the cheap "chocolate-tasting" glaze. Now here I need to mention that if you like your cookies overly sweet, overly buttery and covered with a dozen different toppings, you might be disappointed. The cookies here are not over-the-top, but for my European palate they are just right - they taste great without being overpowering. And why would you want something to overpower their exquisite Lavazza coffee? It is so good that it has to be a shining star, complimented by the cookie. 
I haven't had any of their savory foods, but a couple that shared the ham&cheese panini at the table next to me seemed very happy with their food.
Overall, Teddy's bakery is great, and I will keep coming back every time I am around.What's the fuss about this place? I really don't get it. Been here several times since 2007 and every time I visit, I end up leaving with this question in mind. I mean come on now... I am very outgoing person and this is not even my top 10 Thai food I have eaten in my list... Exaggerated...Considering adding this one to my "won't return" list which already includes the TR off 83rd Ave south of Bell and the one off Happy Valley east of 17. Here's why: 

Rib eye was the thinnest steak this side of Golden Coral. Maybe it was because we arrived about an hour before close and their better cuts had sold off. Don't know. But, it was ordered medium rare. The first knife cut showed medium well. But, it was on an outer edge. Maybe the temp would improve further in? Nope. Went to well done. By that time, enough had been eaten so as to be unfair to send it back.

On the good side, the pulled pork dinner was its usual good quality and flavor. Same for the house margarita.

The server was friendly and sporadically attentive. I think she was ready to be done. To-go boxes were offered pretty early. No attempt to sell a second margarita. And, no attempt to sell dessert.

Note to management: The "do you want fries and a Coke with that line" is food service 101. A server should always attempt to sell a 2nd round (unless the patron is already visibly affected by the alcohol) and always should suggest dessert!

I remain a fan of TR. But, I'm refining my list of which locations really deliver - perhaps their model doesn't really fit the "typical" Sun City crowd? The experience was not the same and it was "only" 9 p.m. on a Saturday night.Delicious!!! Very unique seasoning that is amazing.  As well as keeping the integrity of basic Mexican food. Highly recommend this little neighborhood Jen.Great staff, quick, clean and so yummy every time. Always get hot and sour soup and general Tao. They make it as spicy or mild as u like. Always busy, food fresh.Been meaning to try this place for over a year and so glad I did! The nicest people work here and own it, service is fabulous. I had the turkey pesto panini with southern potato salad - both were delicious! My husband had the brisket sandwich, apple slaw and potato salad and was super happy about his meal too. We walked out of there with some scrumptious baked goods - a sea salt Carmel cookie and an oatmeal cream pie - both were delicious! Will definitely be back for more!The food is amazing and Maria's exceptional service made my eggs taste that much betterThis place used to be owned by really cool people who brewed their own delicious beer and made good food. Now it's owned by people who don't  know what's on their own menu or the names that coincide with each dish. The food used to be pretty amazing, but now it is underwhelming and hardly deserving of being described as mediocre. I took a friend there not realizing things had changed, but thought I'd give it a try anyway. I could have gotten better white sauce out of a jar. Had I realized how bad their food was, I would have. Their cheesy breadsticks are simply a frozen breadstick baked with a string cheese in the middle. Those were good, but hardly worth the price. And it took FOREVER to get our food (it was a to go order). Utterly disappointing. The restaurant was clean and the people were not rude, but that's about the only positive thing that can be said.If you don't like IMITATION SALAD DRESSING don't come here. I was extremely disappointed after I was craving a salad bar salad & saw\/tasted their disgusting salad dressing. I was hoping it tasted better then it looked in the tub... All of them were super transparent & watery. . Tasted horrible!!!
 My husband & I ate two bites of our salads & couldn't even eat another. GROSS!  Everything else is just, eh..3.5 for me! 

I was really excited when this place opened since there isn't a place like this in the path yet. So far I have tried the pizza, pasta and antipasto bar. My fav would def be the antipasto bar - many unique options here and the salads are delicious. I especially like the chickpea salad, arancini balls, and mushroom artichoke salad. 

The pizza is ok, crust is kinda too thick and hard for me. I tried the paparadalle pasta as well but it was so so and for $18 it was not worth it.

They don't accept cash - card only. I feel like overall it's pretty pricey unless you get only a slice of pizza or small box of antipasto but that doesn't fill you up. I wouldn't come here everyday, but more as a splurge.Firstly, Id like to dispel previous reviewers that mention this as a tourist trap.  This is not at all that.  It is a very nice, classic french cuisine restaurant.  You will find certain dishes in the menu that are modern creations, and others that are very classic.  The decor is sort of French Rococo.  The service was very good.  Our waiter was very attentive and helpful.  Of note our first language is spanish, and he spoke perfect spanish and english (also french).  For app had the pate, very very good, and my wife had the salad which was also very fresh and savory.  For dinner my wife had the chicken, which she loved and I had the veal chop, cooked perfectly.  For dessert had an assortment of cheeses with a glass of port, very good as well.  In general it was a very nice experience and delicious dinner.  Don't expect weird combinations by the chef, they offer classic fare, which is also nice from time to time.  I fully recommend it.This is our favorite Cheers bar. Bartenders and staff are always friendly, love the Johhny Rocco salad with grilled shrimp and scallops. Pasta of course, but the Mama Mandola Sicilian Chicken soup is our favorite. We visit almost once a week.I love this place!  Im a regular here and the staff is always friendly and knows how to make great coffee! Try the scones, they are delicious!Unfortunately, I did not have the opportunity to eat here :( After a late night out on the strip, we asked our Uber driver if there were any local spots that sold tacos open (It was a little after 4) she took us to Tacos El Gordo and said it was delicious. We arrive around 4:20\/4:30AM. The lights were on inside and the hours on the door said OPEN UNTIL 5AM. However, when we walked in staff was yelling at us that they were closed. 

There was a security guard outside who was nice. She said she has been telling them to change the hours on the door as well. But so far, nothing has changed. 

So um... change the hours on your door and update your Yelp to current hours so fellow visitors won't be disappointed like us!!

As a result, we were 3 girls standing on the Strip waiting for our uber for a while. Not safe.I normally love jimmy johns but their platters were horrible. My company order from them for an event not only did the miss half the order but the sandwiches were not even made right. One sandwich had a little small piece of ham and the rest was cheese it was very disappointing. The bread was not soft like usual and it really was disappointing because you can tell they didn't even care to make the order right. I don't know of I would ever order a catering event again3.5 stars - I had this bookmarked for so long and am happy I was able to finally try it.

The staff was helpful and sweet and explained everything to me (not my first time for mBBQ but each restaurant is different) 

I opt for the $13.99 all you can eat dinner and was able to eat about 3 plates. The sauces available were meh but I was happy they had a curry one. There was fire, pineapple, hot, curry, house, sweet, soybean oil, sesame oil and garlic.

I wouldn't oppose to come back and would definitely do so if I was in the area - hence my 3.5 star rating rounding up, but if we are comparing my first experience with mBBQ and here, I wasn't as impressed with the flavors since it was a bit bland.Took my wife here for our anniversary. The view is spectacular. We sat at a window table and watched the fountains at Bellagio. Worth the price of the meal itself. Service was impeccable.
Food was good, Nancy has the chicken and I had a filet. Not something you do every day, but it was nice to play tourist for a few hours.Came here with my wife to have some drinks. The establishment was clean and not crowded. We liked that they have a variety of beer on tap. Its a nice little place to chat and have some drinks.Always a chill place to come have a craft beer, and even a nice meal too.

There's about 32 beers on tap at a given time and the bartenders are helpful when it comes to samples or suggestions. Whenever I can't make up my mind, the bartenders always have something good in mind.

The prices for the beer are good compared to other places, $4 for a craft tap and 2 for $4 during their happy hour. They make good cocktails too, not just mixers.

In terms of a college bar, the Sidedoor is off the beaten path where you can come with friends and have a conversation without having to yell over blaring music. Not lame by any means though!Go here! The food is just perfect! They made me love fish and I don't even like fish! 

After being surrounded with neon and that Steve Wynn advert that plays when you get into any cab in Vegas, I was feeling like a moment of fresh air off the strip. Firefly is tucked away just far enough where you can catch a cheap cab, or even walk if you're feeling particularly adventurous (or if you indulge in a pitcher of their sparkling sangria like we did). 

The place is incredibly romantic. Everything has a warm red glow, tables are cozy, and although it's a popular spot, we were able to get in at prime time with only a twenty minute wait. I was totally full after splitting 5 tapas in total - the patatas bravas are heavenly and spicy (ask for them spicy - it's not overwhelming, but it adds so much flavor). 

Prices are fairly normal, but after eating on the strip a few days, you'll feel like some kind of coupon queen (or king). Seriously a great find - perfect food, just the right atmosphere, and sangria to write home about.I should probably lead off by saying: I've only been to Mexico once, so this Scandinavian-with-a-cholula-favouring-palate might not have the most solid credentials for reviewing La Tortilleria.  

However, when I'm planning a Mexican-themed dinner...this is my go-to for staples.  In the fridge at the back: flour tortillas, fresh house-made salsa (which, if hesitant, you can test up at the front, too), Mexican crema and cheeses.  Juices, jellies, Mexican vanilla, big tins of hominy and bulk bins of dried chillies are also found here.  

Of special note: an extensive range of hot sauces (ai-yai-yai!), with my standard pick of cholula going for a wallet-saving $1.99\/bottle.  Ai-yai-yai, indeed.

It's impossible to ignore the fresh-made corn tortillas up front (white corn, yellow corn, and organic options).  They smell amazing, and - at $3.99 per kilo - are a great deal.  I proudly carry that steaming paper round of tortillas home with me, tearing off pieces as I walk (people look at me, but I can see: those are looks of food-envy).  

Yelp note: La Tortilleria's corn tortillas don't last long at my house, though it's worth mentioning that they're good in the fridge, and come back to life quickly when frozen, too.  Impromptu taco party?  With just a smidge of forethought, La Tortilleria's got yo' back.  Muy bien.Nice ambiance. Little away from the crowd. Awesome bartenders and even better drinks during happy hour. We had fun!Delicious food!!
Huge portions and decent prices for a hole in the wall place!
Pastrami and loaded fries!
502 burger was to die for!  
Waited for a while but well worth it!Save your time... save your money!

This review can be summed up into three simple statements:  1) Overpriced  2) Extremely small portions and  3) a big disappointment!

If you want great BBQ in Mesa... keep driving east on Main Street; you'll find it just east of Greenfield road.Been here three times now, waited to review since the other reviews are all over the map.  I will say this review is only based on going there for breakfast all three times.

The food is slightly above average depending on what you get.  I've had good luck with the eggs, omelettes, french toast, and all the kids items.  The pancakes, while huge, have been over cooked and dry every time for us.  The bacon, sausage and ham are all fantastic!  Coffee is not bad either.

The reasons for the two star review - First, the price.  I get that they are small business in a city littered with chain restaurants, but it is really a bit much here.

Second, and WAY MORE importantly than the bill is the servers.   These have got to be the most disgruntled servers in all the restaurant business!  For a place this small, and at least 3 servers each time I've been in, they seem disorganized, rushed, stressed, upset, and uncaring.  I've even had to go to the extent of walking up to the 'bar' halfway through my meal to get coffee refilled, and even then it was half spilled all over the counter which warranted eye rolling and so on.

Some of the food is good, and the kids seem to like it, but I am not sure I can tolerate the rude service to continue to go back.The atmosphere is so light hearted and chill. The music motivates you to eat with a smile on your face. All employees are kind! The food which is why anyone comes to a restaurant is so delicious! Recommend anyone that wants an amazing brunch time!This is a local butcher with great staff. Not only are they friendly, but they are also quite helpful and accommodating. Their meat is fresh and local. It is a regular stop for me. I have also been having their salads regularly, including their take-out menu items.Managers need to help the staff at lunch time. Horrible service.I was really in the mood for some lasagna one day and decided what better place to get lasagna than Little Italy, right? Wrong. I ordered two servings of lasagna and one medium sausage and pepperoni pizza. The lasagna was mediocre in the sense that I could have had better if I bought a frozen Stoffers one from Giant Eagle. The ricotta cheese to meat ratio was about 70-30. Myself, not being a huge ricotta cheese fan, that's my only real complaint about the lasagna. In fact, the lasagna is the reason why I'm giving the food two stars instead of one. The pizza on the other hand is what earned Mama Santa's such a low review. I opened the box and began on one of the slices in the car and was immediately disgusted. I absolutely hate chain pizza restaurants but that honestly would have been a better choice than the cardboard I had just consumed. I ended up taking it back to work and leaving it for the other officers to eat; however, they were just as appalled as I was. While they attempted to consume the bland excuse for a pizza I began working on the lasagna I described earlier. Ultimately this was a wasted $40 and leaves me wondering if friends and family of the employees are saying "best pizza in Cleveland." This was the first time I've ever thrown away pizza.One of my favorite places to go for lunch during the work week. I always get the boneless strips, cajun or hawaiian. Love that they have the drink machine with over 100 choices. Fries are very good. 5 boneless strips, fries and a drink is $8-9.Good food for a good price. If you need a good meal real fast, just drive through Filberto's. Besides, the chicken is good for us Service Dogs!My girlfriend and I went last Friday to celebrate my birthday. We had a reservation for 9:30p. We arrived there around 9:20p and was seated in less than 10min. Which we truly appreciated because we were starving! We heard so much great things about this place that we couldn't wait to experience it ourselves! Unfortunately, we were seated right by the door that opens up to the outdoor dining. You would think that with reservations, we would, at least, get a decent seating compared to when you are just walking in without one! A staff and a customer tripped on my girlfriend's seat in the process of going out that door. Very annoying to have people walk by your table non-stop during dinner while you hope that none of them would tilt a tray of food\/drinks into your heads. 

When our waiter came, his name we couldn't pronounce but sounded like a foreign name (Enie, Enye or something like that), he was very standoffish. We told him that it's our first time there but he didn't seem to care. My girlfriend asked about the wine as she doesn't want anything dry but our waiter dismissed her with a "all of our red wines are dry" comment. Then he left to give us time to decide without offering any help or suggestions. When he came back, I told my girlfriend to pick whatever she wanted so she ordered Reisling. When our waiter came back, he didn't even look my way, talked directly to my girlfriend (btw, we could hardly understand him in the first place!) and serve her the wine to taste and approve instead of serving me first. He asked my girlfriend about what we wanted to order, still not addressing me as he should have. Was he trying to insult me? We let it pass but my girlfriend was getting upset. If it wasn't my birthday and that it was late, we probably would've walk out of there by then.

Our food came and I have to say, it was delicious! The bone marrow was what everybody said it would be and the chicken liver was great! We had the 45oz ribeye and it was perfect-- charred on the outside, pink on the inside! We enjoyed our meal despite the non-stop stream of people going in and out that door right next to my seat!

Needless to say, we enjoyed the food but not the experience. It was very disappointing considering how hard it is to get a reservation in this place. Maybe they should remove that table by the door and remind their waiters to be more friendly and polite especially to those first timers in their restaurant. We tip that waiter 20% for his rudeness. Maybe he would be nicer to others.Very good, gotten takeout here 7 or 8 Times and its always been really good. Service was quick and food was always fresh. Pad Thai and Panang Curry are delicious.We are relocated Californians who have been missing our sushi. This rivals some of our favorite LA spots. The salmon and the uni were extra special. We had to take out but even that was a great experience - a very convenient online ordering system and great customer service. We'll be back and next time hope to enjoy the great ambience!You'll have to take this review with a grain of ocean salt since I've never eaten at the famed Oyster Bar at Palace Station. But having been thwarted by the long lines on the smoky casino floor several times and not wanting to lose any more vacation time to this, we gave up on trying the famous one and went to one of its lesser-known cousins. Based on reviews we decided to try the Oyster Bar at Texas Station. Though it closes earlier (or rather, at all) than the PS OB, they still seated us a half hour before closing on or near Christmas with a gracious (but weary) smile.

This location had a whole restaurant area with tables, as opposed to the single bar at PS. Also, the C-shaped bar here was at least twice the size of the PS bar. I don't know if it was because Texas Station is a lot less crowded than Palace Station, but it was a lot less smoky overall, and the restaurant itself was not smoky at all. (Also parking was much easier.)

We ordered the lobster pan roast (5 spiciness) with rice and pasta. At first they gave us just rice because the cook had pony trailed it but it was easy to get our pasta. The bread for dipping was meh, and the linguine was on the soft side, but the pan roast itself was delicious. It tasted exactly how I imagined. The spiciness level was not so hot I couldn't taste the other flavors, and the lobster was slightly underdone to keep it from overcooking in the boiling-hot bowl. There were at least 7 large chunks of tail and claw meat and lots of smaller pieces. One order was enough to be a full for both of us, with leftovers. (At home we added chicken, sausage, and our own pasta to the sauce to get a whole second meal out of it.)

Both the cook and the waitress were friendly and chatted with us through the meal, but weren't overbearing. Though they started cleaning, putting up chairs and doing side work while we ate, they still made sure our waters were filled and even told us not to hurry when we apologized for still being there after closing time. We weren't even the last ones to leave.

Because it was their error they didn't even charge us for the side of pasta. Between that and the cheaper prices compared to PS, we calculated that it would cost the same to eat at PS and leave a 20% tip as it would to leave a 100% tip here, so we did. Merry Christmas, y'all.The transition from a bank to now, this coffee shop is incredible!  It's a very comfortable, clean setting.  The interior was completely gutted and redone.  From icecream, to specialty cofees, muffins and sanwiches and cakes... there is a lot to enjoy.  Many things you can't find anywhere else.  Pistachio muffins are delicious!  It's a great place to enjoy a coffee and whatever and do my work.What a bargain! Long gone are the days of 1.99 midnight steak n eggs. But for the new revamped Vegas this is a STEAL. For 45.99 with your players card * which you can sign up for on your way in* you'll get 24 hour access to a wide variety of amazing buffets. I was staying at the Paris and went to dinner at 6:30 pm Tues ten went for "4th meal" desert and coffee  at 9:45pm. Got up Wed morning went to Breakfast, then Lunch then dinner at 6:pm. I got 5 HUGE meals in an amazing Buffet. YES I only went to the Buffet in Paris. But WOW want it amazingMy first experience here was disappointing.  So I decided to give Treehugger's another shake.  Well, glad I did.  This time I went for the Roasted Beet salad and added on organic grilled chicken.  What a home run!  The presentation was beautiful, the beets were thinly sliced and roasted, the chicken was grilled perfectly, and the oranges, dried cranberries and feta nestled among the honey lemon vinaigrette were scrumptious.  Yes you will pay $12-$15 for a salad here but it is the quality of ingredients that makes it worth it.The positives: the chicken pita and fries were great
The negatives: the tables, chairs and ledge next to the window were disgustingly dirty
The host was too into the game to seat us. "Pick a booth" my family and I were told.
The waitress forgot my drink and got the kids' drinks wrong.

2 stars is generous. Other Arahovas were better.Place is garbage, over priced, with lousy service.  Went there last nigh had a party of 5, Cyndi thought she needed to add 20% gratuity to our bill so she didn't have to really work for a tip. Just an awful place.Wow!! First ever brunch and it is delicious hurry come down. Goes until 2pm. Check out the photos posted below.Came here a few times for both lunch and dinner. The ambiance is completely different. 

At lunch you have a few choices of meal such as the salmon tuna bowl or the curry. They're all around 10-15$ and all very tasty. 

In the evening, everything changes (when the fire nation attacked...). It becomes one of those noisy izakaya with many more choices on the menu. Their cocktails are also pretty good. 

The service is great. Our waiter made recommendations and gave me one of those japanese leaves to try because i didnt know what it was and it was in their mojito. 

Anyway, a good place to go for a quick lunch or to chill after work.Pizza is really good. We've tried a bunch of different apps and none are really good. Only go here for the pizzaThe steak is delicious.  Easily in category of the TOP 3 best steaks I've ever had.

"The Ultimate Steak" platter, 120oz of steak for $250 - DELICIOUS!!!!! -The steak is cut into thin slices for your entire party to enjoy, so you don't have to worry about dividing it up.  We had it medium rare and it came out PERFECT.  Slightly bloody, juicy, and tender.  Just writing this review makes me mouth-water for it!!  

We had a party of 5 guys and 1 girl sharing this and we were all STUFFED w\/o any leftovers (keep in mind 3 guys in my party were over 200 lbs).  You can probably get away w\/ 7-8 people sharing this monster.  Plus for the price?  $250 seems like a lot but split between 6 people is $40 a head.   Score!!

Sides
Macaroni & Cheese - Above average - The Mac & Cheese is delicious.  It came out baked and was still crunchy (I hate when it's creamy\/runny).  Worth it.
Cream Spinach - Average - Wasn't anything memorable, standard spinach.  

Dessert-
NY Style Cheesecake ($10) - Exceptional - This is a delicious dessert!! The cheesecake is rich & thick.  I was amazed w\/ every bite I ate.  
Strawberry baked Alaska ($10) - Average.  Don't remember it being any memorable. I'd pass on this.
Grilled Banana Smores ($10) - Below average.  This was ok, but wasn't anything special.  You can buy all the stuff at home for half the price and it'll taste the same.  I'd suggest asking for extra graham crackers tho.

TIPS:
-Bread is complimentary UPON REQUEST.  Ask for bread!  It's delicious too.
-Place turns into a lounge\/club at night.Awesome meal any foodie would love. Especially enjoyed the seafood bisque   Wonderful service. We had very charming, knowledgable and entertaining wait staff.Been here a total of two times, both times were during their restaurant week. But I have been pretty impressed and loved what they had to offer.

For starters, this restaurant is tiny! By tiny I mean it probably can't fit more than 20 people. But that is also why it makes this place feels cozy.

For appetizers I remember their butternut squash soup. That was very delicious! I am not a fan of butternut squash but the soup they made was great! I don't remember the entree I ordered but I do remember it being really good! I  pretty sure this is one of the few places that manages to keep their chicken dish juicy and tender instead of dry and tough! And lastly, omg dessert heaven! Doesn't matter what you get, they are amazing!!! From presentation to the taste, everything is awesome. I would totally come here just for the dessert.

If you want to come during a weekend, please make reservation. I doubt you will ever get seated without reservation due to their size.I love Italian dining and my first experience with Naples 15 was extraordinary. The entire experience was awesome. I was most impressed when the chef came to the table -- and that kind of service so rarely happens. Both the service and the cuisine are exceptional. It is truly an authentic experience.  I'll be back!!!!!!!!Great place for drinks and food in the heart of Las Vegas. Good happy hour with drinks and appetizers. The wings are great, I like them hot. Had The Sinatra which was fantastic. The ambience is always fun and party like. We come here all the time.Decent food tried thee shrimp n grits corn fritters mac n cheese n chicken n waffles... Service was good. They were out of the kool aid when i went unfortunately. But i will say the shrimp n grits were one of the best I've had outside of my own. Mac n cheese had  good flavor , waffles were soft like stated in another review like a pancake i would prefer mine to have a slight crisp so may wanna ask to cook alil longer if this is u. My chicken wing was excessively cooked but still decent  . Will give another try n would recommendDelicious, authentic Jewish food. Where else can you find matzo brie, lox and cheese blintzes?? This place! I really love Chompies. Jewish comfort food like Matzo ball soup just can't be beat. Some stuff is gimmicky, like the Jewish Sliders, but it is all still tasty. Portions are BIG! Service is friendly. I've been coming to Chompies since it was located on Greenway Rd. I believe the prices were better and the food fresher at the old location. The new location has greatly expanded business, and is beautifully decorated...... but seems like it came with a price to consumers. Exactly how much overhead am I paying for? Still a go to for breakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner- whatever. It is always tasty and a good time.  

*I must add- Chompies has an EXTENSIVE bakery- one of the best in the valley I'd say. They also have a fantastic deli to boot. This is a GREAT place to buy bagels, cream cheese, black & white cookies, and rugalach (sp?)Eew!!! A salad with shredded iceberg lettuce and a few measly specks of bell pepper topped with disgustingly shredded chicken. Dressing was way too oily. The whole experience was less than mediocre. Fortunately I'm not in Phoenix too often in the D Terminal. Will eat somewhere else next time!!Had a great time at the Mother's Day Buffet on Sunday.  It wouldn't have possible without our excellent server "Cecee" who got us a great table for our party of four. 
The food selection was EXCELLENT just like the Service from our server!Food is SO good, different, creatively refreshing!  What a great place to have a power lunch.  We had prosciutto wrapped asparagus and burrata with spicy tomato jam and even jalapeño cheese grits.  And even though short ribs are over done for at least ten plus years, these were amazing!This place is located walking distance from the strip. The husband had been here before and had mentioned that they had a pretty good deal where you get prime rib AND a beer for less than $20. After waiting less than 10 min, we were seated and quickly had someone taking our orders. We asked about their prime rib and beer special and we were sadly informed they no longer have it. Womp womp. Still decided to give it a go. My prime rib wasn't very good but the husband's was. Mine had way too much nerves and fat which wasn't tasty for me, but the freaken green beans were super bomb! I couldn't stop eating them! They were seasoned to perfection, crisp and not too soggy. The baked potato was pretty good too. I ordered an IPA (this place brews their own beers) The beer was only $2.50. Decent place but I would maybe skip the prime rib, def not as good as the husband hyped it up to be haha. I did see the meatloaf on the table next to us. It looked and it smelled good.Good buffet, we come back time after time. Love the coupons and a free meal on your birthday! Family friendly!The owner and staff here act like they've never sold a bagel before, I felt like I was in the twilight zone. Our group of 5 walked in and they ignored us. When we finally got their attention, they took just half of our orders and then continued avoiding eye contact. The owner was passive aggressively telling his workers to help us out, while doing absolutely nothing himself. And when it came time to pay they they had crumpled up the bag with my bagel in it. They also got several of our orders wrong. Clearly these people have no idea how to run a store or any type of business for that matter.Would not even give this restaurant one star! The worst Mexican food I have ever had. The food had absolutely no taste, and the plate was drowning in cheese. Disgusting. Similar to what another reviewer wrote, the beef tastes like the beef from Taco Bell. In fact, Taco Bell has better Mexican food than this restaurant.

The prices are also absolutely ridiculous. Have not seen prices this high in all of Las Vegas. They really need to lower their prices if they expect to have customers!

Lastly, the service was horrible. After taking a drink order or giving us our check, the waiter would disappear for 20 minutes.

Overall, a huge disappointment, and now I have a horrible stomach ache from the disgusting food.

Thanks Coyotes!I am considered a "regular" and have enjoyed UTT's food, ambiance and service excellence for more than a year. So, why the sudden review? Simply put, the Jerk chicken salad is such an explosion of tastes- hot, spicy and sweet! Cold and hot together! Tender, spicy Jerk chicken pieces on a bed of spinach with roasted pecans and pineapple and a raspberry vinagrette on the side - why can't all salads be like this?? I would have posted a photo, but it just didn't last long enough! And Kim's service, as always, was stellar!I went here with my colleagues for a co-worker's farewell lunch party. I was surprised that the place filled up quickly with many business people. We all order different noodles that were pricier compared to other ramen shops nearby. 

At another table, we saw the waitress serve them fried chicken. We.quickly took a look at the menu to find out the description of the big feast. It was perfect to share with a party of 8 for the portions and price with caviar but we were too late to change our order. Maybe next time when we have another chance with a large group.

Overall, I would only dine here a few times as there are other places with better ramen. However, the place has a more social atmosphere and we did not feel rushed. Winter ramen was pretty good with the chicken nicely cooked. The bowls are huge but made the dish look small in comparison despite the portions were just right for lunch.The service was great but the food was terrible. Us egg.....not good eggs at  all. My husband asked for over easy eggs and got hard ones. I ordered  an omelet but my eggs were hard and tasted terrible. The hash browns were the frozen style and not cooked all the way. Will not be returningI went to have dinner with a friend tonight. 

The decor is somewhat average with TV screens showing sports everywhere, even on the patio. The tables are a bit cramped together, expect to hear your table neighbors well. 

They do have a good selection in the menu with a lot of Gluten free options. The prices are fair. 

To start, I had the Italian Wedding soup (4\/5). Nice big bowl of pastina pasta, beef and dill .I then had the Rustic BBQ chicken salad (4\/5). Good portion, tasty with the peppers, coriander and tortilla bites. 

My friend opted for a Pear & Gorgonzola salad topped with a chicken breast. (2\/5). He really like his salad at first, but the more he dig,the more black lettuce leaves he found. Weren't really impressed. The waitress was nice enough to give a discount on the salad. 

Speaking of waitress, ours was very friendly and sweet, but the service was really slow. I think they were low staff and  it took forever to place our order and get served. The place was not full either. 

There's a lot of good options around this area, I hope they will try to improve consistency in food and service.I went there for my birthday dinner and it was one of the best meals I've ever had. They always add a nice touch and put "happy birthday ____" on the top of the menu which is fun and they give you one rolled up with a ribbon to take home. 

I had the cedar planked Scottish wild isles salmon and it was literally the best salmon I'd ever had in my life. I love salmon and I make it and order it a lot. It was like butter. It had a maple whiskey glaze which gave it the perfect amount of sweetness, and it had a perfect char on the outside edges from the sugar. It was just so frickin good. So so so good. Compliments to the chef. 

We got the buttermilk fried oysters and shrimp kisses for appetizer and they were both ridiculously good. 

The lobster mashed potatoes have chunks of lobster meat in them and lobster bisque poured over the top. Holy hell. So good.  

I was pretty immersed in my own food so I barely came up for air and have no idea what everybody else thought of their food  My sister got the scallops with the crab potato hash and I did try that and it was amazing. 

Everything was so decadent and rich and amazing and definitely an indulgent food type of meal but SOOO worth it. 

They gave me a molten cake on the house for my birthday which is obviously amazing cuz how can you go wrong with that, and then we also got the upside down apple pie with walnuts and cinnamon ice cream, the chocolate bag and the chocolate silk pie which were soooo sooo good. Everything was so rich and delicious but not so overly sweet that it was distracting (which is an issue with a lot of desserts in my opinion). The mousse inside the chocolate bag was actually very light and refreshing almost. 

So basically....eat here, it's amazing. Such good food. I'm still thinking about that salmon hahaWe ate The Fairmount at Cleveland Scene Magazine's FLAVOR party.  The lobster Mac and Cheese was delicious. Their fresh House made Ginger Beer with alcohol was fabulous.Took them more than 1 hr to bring my food, 
Never happened to me something like this in that restaurant... So I was very very disappointed this time.This place has hit rock bottom . Food gone down hill and employees are slow & stupid . Never againI was craving oysters for a while so I did my research on yelp and pearl diver has a great happy hour for oysters! I noticed not a lot of places have happy hour on a daily basis so it was hard finding one but i'm so glad I found pearl diver. I came with a group of 6 and we ordered quite a lot. First off, we ordered 3 dozen oysters. These were great oysters I really recommend them! Especially at the happy hour prices! We then ordered a lot of things off the menu. There were a few changed in the menu so instead of a summer chowder we had a clam chowder. This was great tasted like a normal clam chowder. The mussels focaccia was the best part! It was so good and amazing to dip the bread in the mussel juice. I also got to try other things from my friends. The po boy was really good. I usually don't order sandwich like things but this po boy tasted amazing I would order it. The only downside that I had was the mash potatoes I ordered tasted very bland. I wouldn't order that again. There was just a lack of flavor.I love this place! I've only ever been here for breakfast, but the servers are always nice and the food is awesome. It's comfort food, for sure, and they give you huge portions! If you haven't tried this place out, it's definitely a sound alternative to your normal breakfast place!
I'm sure their lunch\/dinner items are just as tasty!The food is tasty, but the price is not as cheap as I had expected and the quantity is small. I ordered a grilled pork chop and chicken on steamed rice and it was really tasty, but the two pieces of meat was really thinned out and there was some cabbage on the side. For $9 the box was really light. Made me regret not going to HoSu down the street.

I enjoyed the food, but this is basic Vietnamese pork chop and chicken and going to any vietnamese restaurants in chinatown would have provided the same thing at better quality and quantity, service, and atmosphere for about the same or cheaper price.I have been to Fez so many times that I know several of the employees and I always have a hard time deciding what I want to eat...

The interior is very modern and hip
with a very trendy vibe
Patio seating is great
Smoking is allowed on the patio

Everything on the menu is pretty good depending on what you are feeling
The Kisra's are good
The steak is good
The burgers are good
Seriously, depending on what you are craving... whatever you get, will be good 

Also, it's a great place for Brunch

My go-to is the Fez Burger with the Spicy Harissa Fries
My friends and I usually go to Fez after volleyball for food, snacks, and of course, drinks....
Fez has some really great daily drink specials
I love how they make their margaritas with the sugar rim and a gummy worm 
The G spots are another good special
The 'tini's are great
My friends and I love the Cherry Bomb

All in all, Fez is a great place especially for groupsMy boyfriend and I visited Montreal this week! We randomly stumbled upon this cafe! We ordered the TMC croissant with bacon and another with ham. AMAZING croissant I have ever tasted!!! The croissant was fresh and so were the ingredients. The TMC had hard boiled eggs, lettuce, tomatoes, cheddar cheese and house mayonnaise. 

We actually ended up going back the next day! I ordered the TMC with bacon again. The second time, my boyfriend ordered the bagel breakfast. It was a sesame seed poppy bagel with bacon, Swiss cheese, lettuce and tomatoes. The bagel was also amazing. 

The atmosphere was very intimate and clean. The service was exceptional. The presentation was very on point for a breakfast Cafe. 

I would highly recommend this place!I had a great time trying out the Henderson location today. All of the staff were nice and helpful. They go at a slow pace so that everyone can keep up with the process. 

I will definitely be back. I enjoyed the atmosphere & the painting was therapeuticThis little lunch heaven deserves all of the praise it gets! 

It's a tight squeeze, but they helped me riggle my stroller in and get seated. Immediately upon getting settled everyone who worked there popped by to squeeze our baby, and tell me they're a family run business and one of them is expecting and how they would all be serving us. Incredibly nice. 

I couldn't resist ordering a plate of spaghetti in meat sauce and my darling date had their quiche. It was all incredible. You can taste the homemade love in everything they do. If I lived or worked around here, I would be here all. The. Time.First timer at DK today and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised!!! Great little hidden location not busy or overcrowded. The service was excellent and help with ordering that right dog was exact!!! Not a huge menu but enough selection to make you go back to try another!!! We will definitely be back and surely recommend!! Danish Dogs!!!!!!!Kids have a blast.. Wish they would have wings and beer that would make it perfect.. Pricey on food great place for the kidsWe stayed there this weekend and upgraded to a suite that costed over $2000.00 for the stay. There were bugs in the room, it took 3 calls for in room dining to clean up. We had an issue with management Shari and Manuel the front desk managers. Very RUDE!! We will never stay there again. By far the Bellagio and Caesars are 100% better than this Venetian.This place is new so it's very clean and quite spacious.  It doesn't seem to have as many games as Dave & Busters, but I like it for it's clean atmosphere and hardwood flooring.  There is also a bowling alley there $34\/hour plus $3.50 to rent shoes.  So it can get pricey - 6 people max to a lane.  

They also have a slew of tables to host birthday parties and a nice pizza restaurant, too.  The hubs takes our son to Dave & Busters often and said though this place is cleaner, D&B is much cheaper and has more variety for games.  We probably won't go here that often as it is quite a drive for us but were meeting friends there this particular day.I have enjoyed the wonderfully flavorful, piping hot, and infinitely customizable dish that is Pho Ga at multiple restaurants around Cleveland. However, Number One Pho (aptly named) holds the top honor in my heart. Number One Pho's spacious and clean layout, friendly staff, and convenient location make for the perfect casual date night\/girls lunch\/etc...

The Pho Ga (Chicken Pho) is fresh, flavorful, and extremely addictive. The rich broth, savory chicken, delectable rice noodles, and side dish of add-ins (bean sprouts, Thai basil, sauces, and jalapenos...) make Number One Pho's Pho Ga an A+ dish.

In my humble opinion, Number One easily trumps nearby competitor, Superior Pho. If you are looking for fresh and flavorful Vietnamese cuisine, make your way to Number One Pho!What a great place for some spicy food....I forget the names but you cannot go wrong with Ethiopian. This time around the food wasn' t that strong. I highly reccomend the lentil....wow that was good. The chicken and beef stew was good as well. The entire entrée  was so good....me and the lady finished it off....nough said.

G approved!We went to Heist for the first time for a late lunch with friends on Saturday. Heist is both brewery and restaurant with a huge dining area. The restaurant has a very cool and trendy vibe. Our server must have told us a three times that Heist was "a brewery first, a restaurant second," but the beer didn't really hold up to that. The food was better.

To make it easy, we shared a flight of beer. We didn't love the beers we selected and wish there had been a bit more guidance from our server when we asked.

For lunch, I had the sriracha fried chicken salad and it was huge and very good. The salad came with a tasty flatbread\/ pizza slice too. My boyfriend opted for the decadent cheesy mac flatbread. His flatbread was a thin crust pizza with macaroni noodles and what was basically nacho cheese on top. I couldn't eat a full order's worth, but he didn't seem to have any trouble demolishing it. Our dining companions ordered the wings, which are huge, and a salad\/ flatbread combo. They were both pleased.

We'll def be back for brunch and to give the brews another shot.My favorite Thai place in Las Vargas. Love the staff; very kind and know my boyfriend and I by our first names. Favorite dish is Cashew Chicken. Love that they're not afraid to spice it up!Good food, walked in on a Saturday an they said 10 min wait...ok no problem. While waiting I see 9 open tables, 4 more un bussed...and 3 girls working as hostesses...ummm whos in charge here to see that this is a problem. You dont make people wait for no reason when you have empty clean tables that fit their party!!!Consistantly an hour and a half to two hour delivery time. THAT'S ABSURD. Service is slow and rude. Pretty much all of the staff acts as though they are doing you a favor. Pizza Hut Co. Really needs to make some changes to this location. It just plain sucks.First timer and I must say. Not bad at all. Had the chicken Fried Steak Dinner. Only one minus was that there was not enough gravy on the steak. Other than that the meal was awesome.  I don't remember the last time I went to a place that makes everything from scratch. 

Definitely a place I'm coming back too.I love coming here for the atmosphere and the food. 

Favourites:
-skirt steak
-prime rib with cheese
-pineapple
-cheese bread


One thing I dislike is how long it takes for the servers to come to your table. Everytime they come, you only get ONE THIN slice of meat...and then you got to wait till another server comes to give you another thinly sliced of meat.

The process of eating here can be veryy slow , and you may get impatient while waiting for more steak to come.I would never go back here again. My husband, friend and I went after buying a Groupon and the place wasn't very crowded. The waitress took our order and said my husband couldn't substitute a Belgian waffle instead of pancakes with his omelette and then I was told they were out of home fries and it was only 10:30. She brings mine and my friend's food out and said she would bring silverware. Over 5 minutes later she brings the check and then my husband's food, still no silverware. I was pretty annoyed she brought the check before she had even served all our food. She said she would bring silverware then goes to take an order from another table, so we have to ask someone else. After finally getting some and being able to eat, I was really disappointed in the French toast. The bread was soggy and it had no flavor at all. The pancakes were ok, but nothing great. I was really disappointed and definitely would not recommend going here, not even with a coupon.I may have had high hopes from reading the previous reviews. My expectations were not met there was too much corn in everything and the salsa that they give had a hint of like cinnamon which was really weird. The food came and I had the fish burrito and it was massive but mainly filled w beans. If you want authentic Mexican food go up the street on North Tryon to El Taco Veloz.Oh god the worst pizza ever. I'm not sure if it's just this location, but this was a terrible experience. The pizza was cold, wrong, and like 8x smaller than most pizza places I've ordered from. It also took over an hour for 2 large pizzas. For pizza in Bolton, this place is crap.I don't know what has happened to my beloved Bruegger's...and let me preface this by saying I used to work at a Bruegger's location in Ohio when I was younger so I feel like I know how it can and should be.

When I first moved to the area many years ago this location was pretty decent and seemed on par with other Bruegger's in the US. But the quality of food has gone so far downhill I don't think I will be back to this location and that is really hard to say as a previous big fan of their food. 

Went today for a few things and all of the bagels were in this oblong, smashed down shape. It was hard for the guy to even cut the bagel to put it in the toaster, that's how thin it was. After running it through the toaster, he throws the smallest bit of cream cheese on it. Had to ask for more. So I think it's at least kind of warm. Upon paying, I reach for it and it's stone cold. Not sure what the toaster was doing but it did not actually toast or warm anything. 

Ordered a breakfast sandwich as well for a family member. On an oblong, smashed bagel. The bacon was pretty uncooked. What they now call egg I guess is this extremely sad looking egg white patty that is really slimy. Did not ask for egg white only. Then some cheese on top. The bacon, egg and cheese didn't even cover the bagel due to the shape. Half of it got thrown out at home. It was pretty inedible. 

Makes me really sad to state all of the above. I was hoping this location would turn it around but I am feeling more and more hopeless.This Panda Express location is a difficult one to review.

As is typical of the Panda, the food's good and cooked up fast. No, it's not gourmet Chinese, but it's tasty enough.

But then we come to the weakness of this location: The menu.

The selection is really, really slim. To the point they don't even have sweet and sour chicken, for crying out loud. I'm used to Panda Express locations varying in their options (Potato Chicken and String-Bean Chicken are always hard to come by), but this one really takes the cake as far as limited selection goes.Literally *days* after writing my first review I went back for lunch. They're in the process of fixing the problem that caused the temperature issues. Food and service were top-notch.The burger was perfect, char grilled but very juicy. The grilled onions and mushrooms were done well, they used fresh mushrooms. Lots of flavor.  Truffle fries were very oily, so fyi. Friendly service.Best smoothies, best juices, best chia pudding and BEST smoothie bowls!!! 
The staff is super friendly and makes sure to let you know that you can omit or add to whatever you order.Great bar! Always a great place to have a drink with friends and the food is pretty good. They sometimes have a Dj. Love the atmosphereWow, is all I have to say.

We went for dinner on a Saturday night at 7. There it was only about half full but more people were coming to eat around 9 when we were leaving. I recommend making a reservation just on case; we made one on the restaurant website directly. There are two doors when you go up the stairs; enter using the door on the right, and then veer left when you walk inside; you'll walk up the side of the bar, where a bartender or other staff member will come seat you. There are 2 sides to the restaurant - bar side and a room on the other side. We sat on the bar side and it was really quiet. There are some seats at the bar if you want to sit there. We were dressed casually in jeans and didn't feel underdressed; it looked like most people were in jeans.

This place blew our socks off, truly. The place was cozy, set in what felt like the the first floor of an old house. I don't think we've ever had better service; the staff were very knowledgable, extremely attentive, friendly and warm, and every course was perfectly timed to the extent I've never seen done more perfectly.

The food also greatly exceeded our expectations. The bread was fresh and refilled, and our steak tartare was more flavorful than I've tasted before in my frequent steak tartare indulgences (note that it's served diced, not sliced). I cannot say enough about the French onion soup, which was perfectly made and not too salty; my husband is a french onion soup snob and said he has never had better other than what he's made himself (sure... ;-)). For the main course, the rack of lamb literally melts in your mouth and the portion is quite generous; note that the crust it is quite minty. We also had the beef tenderloin, and I will confess that I didn't know that cut of meat could be so juicy. The cognac reduction was everything. Vegetables for both meals were very fresh and the potatoes weren't fried, which was nice. The relative portion of the beef tenderloin was a bit less than the meat on the lamb. Last but not least, the creme brulee was also delicious; it is the perfect size for 1, but probably too small for 2 people to share.

I'm really surprised by the lukewarm reviews, but I think they mostly relate to cost. Let me be clear: this is not a budget restaurant with cheap, huge portions; it is expensive, very nice French restaurant. With a 4 drinks, 2 apps, 2 meals, and a dessert and our bill was around 180 before tip. If you're looking for a fancy restaurant where you can dress casually (or not, if you want to dress up), have extremely good service, the best meal  you've had in a long time, and a quiet setting to enjoy it in, I highly recommend. We will be back soon!I recently stopped by Lo Zingaro to pick up a Pizza to go, and all I gotta say is that it was awesome.

   Friendly staff, and I look forward to going back and having a  proper dine in experience.  

It was pretty quite for a Saturday night, but then again so was the rest of Queen St. West..  go figure. 

Nice. quiet background music, so ideal for conversation.....I took my son here last night before the Charlotte Hornets game.  When we arrived we were seated right away by a polite host, however we sat there for 20 minutes and never even got drinks or had anyone offer to serve us. The food here may be great and my son really wanted to try their burgers but the service is very bad.  Two tables seated after us got orders taken before us as well, and we had been there at least 15 minutes before.I was looking for something centrally located to have a long, overdue visit with a friend who I was excited to see! I found this quaint little place and what was so great and convenient about the location was the fact that I now know where Hot Yoga on 17th is, literally right next door. I love hot yoga, and regularly go to the studio in Crowfoot.
As for the food, it was delicious, I had the daily soup with a toasty BLT. I loved the atmosphere, the ambiance, and for sure the free wifi. The lady was pleasant, and very friendly. Coffee here was perfect too... Definately worth a visit again in the future!Best Pizza in Vegas hands down! My kids ask for it by name, not by we want Pizza tonight!!  The White pie is amazing as is his Sicilian pie!!  I enjoy his Pepperoni pie with a glass of Merlot.  I can almost eat an entire large by my self and not feel bloated or overly stuffed after....unlike the chain pizza places where the crust and cooking grease make you regret your food choice soon thereafter.  The wings are also great, much better than most wing places and perfect for football or a fight night. I don't always eat Pizza, but when I do...it's JOEY's!My smoothie looks very scary green... But it tastes wonderful. It has all natural organic avocado, kale, coconut, almond milk, banana, agave, and is call a lipo smoothie,  absolutely love this new little gem. My holistic dentist told me about it.I don't particularly enjoy all you can eat restaurant for the obvious reason. The quality of the food in buffets are often compromised. And this place isn't an exception with one difference and that is the price. If you're a fan of all you can eat places, try it here but don't hold your breath.They did a wonderful job on the renovations! It's beautiful inside. Great, friendly staff. My boyfriend and I go strictly for the crab legs! Amazing price for all you can eat crab!Norma, my 91 year old friend, goes here every Tuesday morning for breakfast with other residents of the care center where she lives.  She has raved about it for the longest time so I finally broke down and went with her.  It had been ages since I gone to a Village Inn restaurant and the thought really didn't appeal to me.

I had no complaints about how the french toast with banana and strawberries was fixed.  They certainly served enough of the toppings that no syrup was necessary-fine with me as the latter is much to sweet for me.  The servers as a whole were just nice-ready to serve a relaxed dinner-no hurrying you to finish.

No, it wasn't a gourmet experience.  I do realize that going to this restaurant took me back to a more carefree time in my life when we'd go out to eat before an evening at a play, maybe dancing, or whatever.  Just hanging out with friends, getting to be a little foolish, and generally having a server that could deal with it.  Maybe I need more of that in my life these days.  I will go back.I had curried goat and my wife had jerk chicken. Both were VERY delicious and the prices were great. The waitress seemed to wear a few hats, but she was still very attentive and SO nice and accommodating! Some of the sides were traditional foods and were fun to try, even though i was not too crazy about them, like the dumplings, but we had fun and loved the experience!The first time I came here, it was ironically last year during restaurant week. I remember that they did not know about it initially until they asked someone in the kitchen and then brought the menus out. They were not well organized but they made up for it with good food. They were new at current location. That is why I gave them five stars at that time.
Tonight, I was let down. To begin with, there were five people in my party and I specifically put on my open table reservation that it is for a birthday and the name of the person. I even called the restaurant personally one hour before and they confirmed that they had the information that this was for someone's birthday. 
We get there on time and we are sat at a regular table. We are given regular menus. I see that the waiter is holding smaller menus, which did turn out to be restaurant week menus, but he did not give us those until I asked for them. This is the second year, during restaurant week, where they did not offer the restaurant week menu. Then, to make things worse, our waiter is absolutely clueless! First he tells us that he believes that a filet mignon is on the restaurant week menu that can replace the flat iron steak and then he tells me that there is a dorade type of fish on the menu. Neither is right. We order our food and the food is pretty good. We get to dessert, and nothing! No candle (not important), no decoration (not important), no happy birthday (important). Her dessert was as plain as ours. 
Several times we had to signal the waiter to come over to fill water glasses as they were empty for quite a while. I also had to signal someone for the check. What's crazy is that the restaurant was not full... In fact it was less than half full!
The food at this restaurant is delicious, but the service has a great deal left to be desired. I hope a manager reads this and takes this seriously because I have come to this restaurant over eight times in the last year and usually the service is OK or below par, and it has never been outstanding. I chose to come here instead of going to an incredible restaurant on the strip for convenience because we only live five minutes from this restaurant. I was really let down tonight and my friend's birthday was non existent! This restaurant needs to be careful because it may have great food but it needs to keep up good service. Once again, really let down tonight.another gem in the rough, I would say. this place is excellent.
 Master Yasu is great and friendly. he will cater the food based on what you like\/don't like and be prepare to be blown away.
the fish are fresh, the sushi rice got the right mix of the spices and the kitchen also have some great food. this is how sushi are supposed to taste like.
ask the cheff for Omakase and say, feed me please.The consummate Pizzeria in the Harrisburg Concord area. I say this based on my upbringing in the New York area and comparing their Pizza to that of my memories in New York. These guys understand what it takes to make a New York Pizza, the crust is flaky thin and succulent, the mozzarella cheese delicious, and the slice sizes is proportionate to it where the New York Pizza is supposed to be.  While the Charlotte area has a few pizza locations that can rival this, Brooklyn Pizzeria has Harrisburg Concord area on lockdown.Enjoyed the menu choices, great food and excellent customer service.  Great overall value given dinner for two under $35 (no drinks).  Will definitely be back and highly recommended.  Very friendly owner.nice upscale after hours spot..    get ur swerve on!!Always good for takeout pizza.  They are always generous on the dipping sauce too.  Which is appreciated for a large family.   
Breadsticks are awesome.We ate at the Mood Restaurant and although the menu was small the steaks were wonderful! Justin informed us of the new menu that the chef was working on and he was attentive and answered all our questions in a friendly and professional manner. We would definitely go there again and would certainly ask for Justin to be our server. The manager was very friendly and we had an overall great experience. Thanks Mood and Justin for a great nite out.Great place...
Awesome beer selections draught and bottle! The food is amazing! Don't miss the truffle steakhouse burger! 

Mac daddy Monday! $10 unlimited toppings on you Mac n cheese!

Pimp your burger Wednesday! $10 unlimited toppingsJust love love it here! I know I've ordered the same thing each time I've come to the avocado on wheat toast. It's just so delicious and refreshing. They have a big selection of tea's hot and cold. A big variety in the menu.Will update rating once they fix there beers. Live in the area and go to porch light a lot. We have watch this place get remodeled and saw brewing getting installed which was super exciting. From Denver Colorado lived in LV for 2 years now have been looking for new place to have some craft beers. Went in here and looked around no character or design. TVs on tables, no photos or anything on walls. Sat down and put some money in. Asked for a beer. It came to me warm.  why? So I asked the bartender got hurt about it. Still drank it. Went next door to porch light to have a cold beer!! Woke up with a stomach ache from there bad beer! They need to figure this problem out. Properly close tell so they don't loose to much street credit...The first time I went to Wingporium, it was the night before the Canada-Sweden gold medal match. We were rushed to order because they were closing early because they were opening at 7am the next day. The service was sloppy but we thought it was because the game and decided we would try again. We took our wings to go and Loved the interview with a vampire. So the following Friday we returned. Service was absolutely AWFUL! I felt like I didn't exist and had to walk to the bar for a beer while one server chatted and the other got drink at the bar while they both ate potato wedges. The wings and wedges were great EXCEPT for the "maple" which is actually just table syrup, the drunk server had no explanation for this. The chatty server told us we needed to cash out so she could catch her subway and the drunk server sat at the bar talking to a customer while we were trying to get a beer. At the end of the day the wings are good but the service really ruins this place. Don't bother coming here!I went there just now and wanted to add fried chicken to my sandwich and she said no  I have to do it myself so I ordered a whole chicken and waffle meal and added myself I paid for two meals .. every time I asked for something she always said no ! May get a side of this no! No! DisappointedExceptional value and very tasty.  Nice folks working there, highly recommended.  Clean restaurant.

I really enjoyed all pieces of the chicken that I tried.  I usually only eat white meat but the dark meat was very tasty as well.This is a great dining option inside the SLS hotel and casino. It's casual but still a bit fancy. Not suit and tie required just cash money! 

From the moment you walk in your welcomed and greeted by the hostess. You are immersed by the Chinese writing all over the mirrors and bags of rice for good luck I'm guessing. 

The bar is huge and can seat probably 20+ and is simple yet colorful. 

The dining area his large enough to seat several large groups an couples. 

The menu is simple for both drinks and food. I highly recommend their signature items that are in red. 

Make sure no matter what you order to save room for dessert! 

Chopsticks are standard and you'll have to ask for a fork if you're not a pro. 

There are two huge TVs to catch your sports.

I'll definitely be back. 

If you're in the SLS and want to just chow down, this is the place for you. 

Thanks KU!!I had the Appetizer combo platter, a bowl of Egg Drop Soup and The Wor Siu Duck...
The appetizer platter came with an eggroll, 2 bbq ribs, 2 fried wings, 2 fried shrimp, 2 numaki, and 3 fried wonton. it was all served hot from the kitchen and the price was $6.95
The soup was in a good sized bowl, was piping hot and cost $1.10
The Wor Siu Duck was a little bland, but there was plenty of it, and the price was very ecenomical at $6.95Very average food. The prices for the lunch specials are excellent, but the food is Americanized Chinese and not a very good version of it. The 6 people in my party were underwhelmed after eating here.The ramen is good. Thin, thick, spicy, or not - all good. Very limited seating. Probably only good for party of 4 or fewer. Service is decent.This is a first class establishment.  The owner is very involved in her business and it shows.  Excellent service and great food.This is the first restaurant I have ever been to that serves every style of pizza. 

After walking in, we were barely greeted by the two girls chatting at the hostess stand. I asked to see a menu and was given a dirty one, I handed it back to her and asked for a clean one. She looked at me as if she had something to say then said alright let me look. The second menu she handed me was satisfactory.

After sitting down it took about 15 min for our waitress to come over. As soon as she comes over I ordered the Gorgonzola apple salad, and the honey pie. The salad was very mediocre; the pizza was tasty but had a few flaws. The main flaw being the fried onion strings on top of the pizza. They were unnecessary, made the pizza greasier, and took away from the other great ingredients. Fried onions have no place on a pizza!Honestly this is one of the best k-bbq place I've been to. It's an all you can eat that you get the stuff yourself. This place might look a bit sketchy, and weird but the choices here is very good and delicious. They do change the grill often so the smoke isn't that intense. Do be careful on how much you're getting. Any left overs are charged to you. I would recommend to pace yourself. 

They have so much meat available here. My favorite is the beef ribs and the pork belly. The veggie is super green (which is a good sign). The shrimp here though might be something to consider. After cooking it the shrimp became mush, which tells us it isn't fresh at all. 

The sides choices here were super good as well. The kimchi looks freshly made. I do love their spinach sides and the bean sprouts. 

The staff here is super friendly. They do tend to check up on you one after another to see if the grill is burning. Our table didn't have a thing of water so I'm guessing that could be a reason why some of our stuff burnt due to the grill over heating. If you know how to fire control, do it. Be careful not to off it though. 

I do recommend this place. I haven't found a better one yet.Amazing! Connecticut Lobster roll. Perfect temperature, perfect amount of butter and lemon!Met up with some friends for his birthday. We had a blast the bartender was nice and friendly offered different types of beer I have never had before. Defiantly one of my new favorite bars.Pretty generic to all other Humpty's restaurants. Same decor and menu. 
They one thing that sets this location apart is the superb service. The servers here truly care about their customers and their jobs. A rare gem. 
The food is always fast, and steaming hot.The Earl of Sandwich really does a very good job at making sandwiches and that is all I expected from them anyways. After all they come highly recommended from other yelpers!

I visited this place twice in three days of my stay in Las Vegas because this is probably the best place to get lunch in the area. A little crowded and low on cleanliness but the sandwiches are very good. I can live on their Caprese sandwich if I had to. 

A must go for any vegetarian who is looking for a good sandwich to eat and do some people watching.Loved the food (I'm still thinking about the corn chowder) and our server was nice. 

We were struck by one of the hostesses who acted like she couldn't be bothered when we came back in to ask if we could move from outside (it was beautiful but way too windy) to dine on the patio. I think she actually rolled her eyes as her coworker asked her to seat us in a particular section (really?  all we want is another table, and you are hardly busy). Her overall demeanor was less than friendly and quite aloof.  Fortunately we only dealt with the hostess for a matter of minutes and the rest of our dining experience was good.Came in today to give the Pho a try and I can say it did not disappoint! When I walked in I was the only customer but the staff was super super friendly and couldn't wait to help me. The restaurant was clean and very nicely decorated. The food looked very fresh and made all my order right there. I decided to try the chicken pho since I didn't see raw steak pho on the menu. I got the chicken pho and chicken egg rolls. I had to get it to go since I was rushing to get home but I ate the egg rolls when I got home and they were still hot and crispy. I reheated my pho for dinner and it was really yummy. It had the right amount of seasoning and they provided plenty of garnish to go with it including little packets of hoisin sauce. My only complaint was chili paste wasn't provided as a to go option. I will definitely be coming back!Very clean yet older establishment. My order was this month's special, vegetable lasagna.  It was a little on the runny side and lacked flavor but I still killed it cause I hadn't eaten all day. Came with side salad which was nice and crisp but wasn't too fond of the thousand island dressing.

I feel like they have good food but being my first time, I didn't get the right thing. I would not rule them out though and visit again.I went here with a group of friends (4 of us total) on CINCO DE MAYO just trying to get some tacos and margaritas. We sat in the empty waiting area for 3-4 mins before even being greeted and sat at a table. We got waters and chips & salsa then ordered our margaritas. We then waited 30 mins and still had not gotten our margaritas or had our waters or chips refilled. Even after asking our waitress how much longer it would be and if we could get refills. Needless say we got up and left without being served.Decent food, great selection of beer. There is something to please any palate.  Lots of good people watching and plenty of televisions or other events to keep you entertained while you grub.This place is always busy.  It is your typical Chinese fast food.  I get General Tso combo, always consistant and tasty.  Mega helping, you can share.....Recently visiting our sister-in-law and she goose this place.  First, t s in a nice setting and very friendly staff.  Elizabeth our young waitress was attendant and lovely if a bit new.  We chose to sit outdoors and being a Saturday evening we were entertained by live music.  

My reason for a two star rating was the food.  I order the shrimp and grits.  Although advertised as "creamy cheese grits with southern style shrimp unfortunately my idea of creamy cheese grits is not a dish that must of sat under a heat lamp way too long.  Not creamy more like baked dry with sprinkled cheese on top.  The shrimp were blackened and way too salty.  
My wife ordered one of their specials a Pasta dish with mussels.  She ate only the mussels as the pasta was tasteless and over cooked and once again left to stand to long.  

Suffice to say a truly uninspired meal by any rationale cook.In Pitt for work, so I'm just here to explore the chicken. Got here at nighttime with a party of four

Service - I didn't really keep note of that.
The waitress was weirded out it seemed cause none of my party of four wanted any of their damn beers.

Chicken is my beer,

- blackened Chicken Wrap was AMAZING.
- The fries that came with it was LEGENDARY. They give you half regular fries and half sweet potato. Their sweet potato fries are the best I ever had. They are seasoned well and melt in your mouth.

Like I always say if you don't need  ketchup for the fries to taste good, you have an excellent fry.

Just like if you don't need beer to appear exciting or humorous, you have an excellent personality.

My party had some other stuff that I don't remember but they loved it. Let's just say we enjoyed our food hangover afterwords. It's like the itis but we're not sleepy.

The atmosphere was great dim and grungy.One of the coolest places I visited in Toronto. We got there on a Saturday night around 8 or 9pm and the wait was about an hour. That's a bit long, but trust me the wait is worth it. We got ceviche, mango salad, fried rice, pho beef dip. Everything was excellent and unexpected. There's so much layering of textures and flavors--I suppose Viet cuisine is pretty good at that, but this place does it so well. Plus, it's not in a suffocating environment. Perfect late night spot for drinks and tapas with friends--just expect a wait (for good reason).We came on a Saturday for happy hour and got the edamame, spicy salmon roll and shrimp tempura roll. Great taste, price, cool vibe!!!

The coconut Creme Brulee was a highlight!!  Off-the-chain!!

We will return!!this place was a fantastic, classic italian restaurant. tony was an absolute riot (and fantastic kisser). be prepared to spend a few bucks, but it's very worth is and amazing cocktails!Not too sure what to think of this place. Although I initially enjoyed it, I don't really see myself coming back here. The lunch special is quite cheap though, so that remains an option. I find that all the meats taste exactly the same, and it lacks a certain depth. The BBQ meats are grilled on a mini stove top, and doesn't taste very grilled. The side dishes aren't bad, and there remains many other Korean dishes to try. I would say give it a try, but don't be disappointed if it all tastes the same to you.I never had anything I even saw floyd Mayweather there and the food is awesome! I recommend the next time you are hungry, go there!My wife and I are from PHILLY and when it comes to sandwiches, we know what good is. This establishment makes a 5 star sandwich, hoagie, sub or whatever else you want to call it.  They pack the roll with top quality meats and cheeses that are so yummy you can't stop eating, even when your stuffed. The portions are more than ample. A large sandwich is plenty for two people. 

As an added bonus, if you purchase the yelp coupon for $10 and spend $20 or more you receive $10 off the bill. (I assume this refers to sandwiches, only). In any event, offering 50 per cent off is a major sacrifice for a small business. Especially in this inflationary market. 

For us, it was a win, win situation. and we felt it was only right to return their generosity by spending a little extra and TIPPING the nice lady who made the sandwiches. 

BTW, while I was waiting for my sandwich the board of health inspected the place and replaced their already existing A-rated cert with a more current A-rated cert. 

If you can recognize a good deal and appreciate an immaculate eatery with high quality deli meat, and large portions I highly recommend the House of Vino.I always stop here on my car ride home to Detroit.  The last two times, I stuck stoically by the Miche, which is a bread unexplainable unless you've had it. (And had it done well, such as here)
Today I branched out and added the pepida loaf:  phenomenal!  Full of air pockets inside with a crispy, yet still chewy exterior.  Amazing, as all bread here tends to ve also co queried the cinnamon roll.  Instead of that heavy breadball slathered in cloyingly sweet frosting, theirs is light, almost croissant-like and dusted in a cinnamon throughout.  (Warning:  if you're a Cinnabon-at-the-mall fan, this is probably not for you)Came here for dinner during the week and it wasn't too crowded. There is a decent sized dining room behind the bar. We were started off with some pita. Then, I had the gyro platter for dinner. There was a hearty serving of gyro meat, rice, pita, salad, and tzatziki. The gyro meat was delicious. There were some parts which were a bit too burnt. My friend had the chicken platter and enjoyed it as well. Overall, a good place to get some mediterranean food in the South Hills. The prices are very reasonable as well.Wow! The fat brisket taco made me kick my boyfriend. It was that good. Abstract the server was a pleasure. I will be back to try it all!Very convenient when staying at TI. The food was good, fast, and the service was pretty good as well. But the cost is ridiculous. 18 dollars for a ham and cheese omelet? No. I'll walk down to Denny's for breakfast next time.I have been dining and getting take out here for YEARS.  My absolute favorite salad in the Valley is the RW&B gorgonzola walnut salad.  When I first started ordering it - it was COVERED in gorgonzola, walnuts and onions.  You could not see the greens below all of the toppings - YUMMY !!  However, over the years I have watched this salad dwindle into a pathetic wimpy option that isn't worth the $$ you pay for it.  Remember, this salad doesn't have a protein - the meat of it is the gorgonzola and the walnuts which have decreased to a splash of ingredients.  To the OWNER of RW&B - if the prices of gorgonzola, walnuts & onions have raised that much over the years - I suggest you raise the price of the salad and not reduce the quality of the salad.
Needless to say, I won't be ordering the salad any longer and since that is the ONLY thing I order from there I won't be patronizing the restaurant any longer.   Which is soooo sad because I love that salad & there are not many restaurant options in my area - shame on RW&B !!Not really a large selection.  Food is not bad but not very flavorful.  Drinks were a joke. Watery tea and lemonade.  First buffet I ever ordered dinner someplace else after going.  Might be out of business if college kids were more picky.  One good note.  Noodles were ok.It was OK but no where near the best fish in town.  Really salty (drank like crazy all afternoon).  Coleslaw was typical "from the tub".  No malt vinegar--what is with that--when you have fish, you need vinegar, not ketchup.  Extremely limited seating.Lo siento pero creo que nadie tiene obligación de pedirle a nadie no hablar en su idioma natal.
Como hispana creo que estos dueños ya perdieron la clientela y jamas volveré a comer en lugar que prohibe hablar el idioma a cualquier empleado quien habla un segundo idioma.  Si ami me pagan mas por hablar español en mi trabajo. Paguenle mas a ellos por ser bilingues!!!!
I am sorry but you should not prohibit any employee to speak in a second language. It  is a disgrace that always trying to please other people hispanics have to go through  all of this. You should pay them more for being able to speak two languages. I get pay more money for being bilingual.If you are stuck on the strip and want to eat someplace that is vegetarian friendly, head straight to the Wynn and Encore Resorts. Each and every restaurant at the casinos there has a complete and separate vegan menu!

We have eaten at several places there, but I singled out Botero, because it has the more unusual veggie fare of the bunch. We bought a bunch of smaller items and did a lot of sharing and everything was wonderful.

And for the locals, don't forget about the Wynn Resorts for your special ocassions... It's such a relief to find a veggie friendly place where you can show up in dressy attire and have candlelight and romance.Had a great breakfast experience here. Visiting on a Sunday after the church crowd is there is a bit of a cluster but the overall experience was nice. We went for breakfast but it's definitely more of a brunch location. They had plenty of breakfast options but also equal amounts of lunch as well. And the portion sizes were more than we could handle. Picture posted is the breakfast burrito and breakfast sandwich.It pains me to update this review. I think they have changed management or employees recently and it has not been a good change. The last visit they brought my egg allergic kid a meal with an egg in it, which was quickly discovered and we thought a one-off slip. Tonight they brought her the wrong meal twice in a row! By the third meal they brought her, mine was barely warm. No Manager checking in either time.

We've gone from regulars to not returning. :(

______________________

With Sansotei nearby locations closed on Mondays we decided to give Kinton a try. It was packed on a March Break Monday at noon.

Decor was cool from the waist up. Most of the seating was stools, sprinkled with a few metal booth seats placed at a 90 degree angle. Lots of communal tables for eight in the middle. Less comfortable seating will help turnover customers quickly I suppose. That said, don't expect your meal to come quickly like at a pho place. It will take about 30 minutes from the time you order until when it hits the table.

We ordered:
Fresh lemonade, perfectly tart
Ramune (taste like a melted blue freezie yum). Cute glass marble.
Chicken Karaage ramen - Mondays only - spicy and comes with thick noodles. I had wanted original but was glad I didn't get the choice. Delicious.
Chicken Shoyu with thin noodles and corn - for my kid with the egg allergy. She loved it.
Pork original with thin noodles. The only bowl where all the noodles got eaten.

Service was helpful. Loud, joyful kitchen behind me. Non-stop EDM, which I normally enjoy, but their mix was monotonous.

A repeat for us overall.My husband was looking forward to eating here because he's seen Hubert Keller on PBS.  Great atmosphere, service, etc., but disappointing food.  The meal started great with grilled octopus which was stellar but it was downhill from there.  The angus sliders were good but the truffle oil mac n cheese bordered on tasteless.  The meatballs were meh as was the tarte flambee.  Since only one out of 5 items were anything special we didn't even bother with dessert.  Next time we'll try one of other restaurants in the casino.I don't know what's the hype with this place. Yes, it's a cool concept where you have to find this place through word of mouth and there are no signs anywhere that tells you where to go. However, the quality of the pizza and selection is subpar. (BTW in case you are wandering, this is located on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan hotel)

The first time I went, I had to wait in line for almost half an hour and there's almost no seating inside the place and minimal seating outside as well. This makes eating pizza while holding your water cup extremely difficult. This time when i went, at least there was no line. The choices of pizza were whatever and it wasn't that clear you could add toppings onto the pizza. Each slice was about costco but it cost around 6 dollars without toppings and probably more with each topping. The plates they gave us were very flimsy and the oil leaked through. The pizza flavor wasn't very rich and and crust was not good at all. I have had way better pizza and I don't understand the hype here.I admit I'm not one for exotic meals but I shouldn't need nearly every menu item explained because I can't tell by the title what the food actually is. This is advertised as an American restaurant but the waiter's first question to me upon learning I'm a meat and potatoes person was "Do you like curry and Indian food?" What?!? The bread and butter appetizer and the potatoes dish were good (though that was hardly "potato salad," the description by the waiter.) The monkfish portion certainly fed two. My drink Life is a Peach was bland - no peach flavor at all. The wait staff was attentive so there's a plus. This restaurant is EXTREMELY noisy - so don't expect to hear the person across from you or even the waiter unless you're practically shouting. Most uncomfortable chairs I've ever sat in - the wooden back is tilted. While they look nice and contemporary, theu tilted wood hits you right in your lower back. It is painful! So to avoid the pain, you have to lean forward the entire meal. Now for the real pain : the bill! This is a VERY EXPENSIVE RESTAURANT.  My husband is a foodie and while we will pay good money for good food, this place (given the entire experience) is not worth it. There are many truly awesome restaurants in Pittsburgh that have great innovative food, along with creative staples to suit my palate, that do not leave me walking out in physical and financial discomfort. So... Let the Acorn drop off your list of places to try.We were a party of three and all plates were amazing. Smoked salmon, waffle Benedict, eggs and bacon. . Highly recommended. Seven a beautiful wait staffGreat Arabic food tastes excellent clean place and friendly people , fresh meat and deli the restaurant food clean and one of the bestWell was going to try this place out. Says open till 3 am.
I showed up at 2:18 and they say they are closed.
Would be nice to know they stop serving Earlier.
Gigi to leave this review open till I get a. Chance to try the place. Going down the street to DJKWhat can I say that hasn't been said before? I met my boss here for lunch on a sunny Monday afternoon. We were quickly greeted by we had 2 more people yet to show up so we had to wait for them to be seated.

As soon as our party was there, we were quickly ushered to a table and greeted by our server. 

He informed us that he had been overhearing our conversations at the table and was happy to report that they did have burnt ends and explained to one of my lunch mates what a mufelleta was and what it was made of today. This was a great touch - what an easy way to make a quick and easy impression on a table!

So, I got my burnt ends sandwich, along with sweet potato fries - which I had been told were AMAZING. I also ordered their beans.

We also ordered the cornbread... which was delish!!! I recommend it highly. It was moist, slightly spicy... and full of amazingness!

The burnt end sandwich was increds. Cooked to perfection and flavored wonderfully with a Carolina Red sauce.

The sweet potato fries weren't amazing - they were AH-MAY-ZING!!!!!

The beans were delish as well - and did not need for me to add in any sauce or anything, which is my usual habit.

I have to say... I have been coming to central Illinois for years and I am pissed it took until today for me to get to this place.

I will be back... probably every trip to central Illinois!!!Thanks to Charlotte Mag naming this the "Best BBQ" in town, this was my first stop once I moved down to Charlotte, and I was not disappointed. 

The atmosphere is a bit more modern than some of the other BBQ spots I checked out in eastern NC, but the food was just as good.

For starters, we ordered the cheese fries topped with bits of brisket burnt ends, and those are currently the best appetizer I've tried anywhere in the country. I ate so many I wasn't sure I was going to be able to tackle my main course.

I ordered a full rack of ribs with beans & fries for a side. Since I had already sampled the Eastern NC style vinegar sauce, I went with the SC mustard based sauce, and I absolutely LOVED it! My friends weren't huge fans, but this is my Yelp review, not theirs. 

The rack was MASSIVE, and not too tender, which made it great for dunking in the mustard sauce. My buddy also ordered a rack, but with the house special BBQ sauce, which was also really good. The portion sizes were exactly what I expected, and the sweet tea was extra sweet.

For dessert, I took home a pecan cobble and absolutely fell in love. I haven't been able to stop eating pecan pies & cobblers since!It gets a 3 only because it was priced well. Stopped in tonight, got a half chicken parm sub, which was ok, and an order of bread sticks. $8. Great value. Bread sticks order was huge. Enough for 4 people. That's where the positive feedback ends. Other than a pick up order, I was the only one in there. Literally 35 minutes from order till I was given my food. 35 minutes for a half of a sub and bread sticks. All I got was a, sorry for the wait. Nothing during the whole time there. Terrible. Sub bread was good, but burnt; maybe that's why it took 35 minutes. Anyway, service was 0 stars;  food was 3 and value was 5 so I give them a 2.5 - 3. Not sure I'd go back, but price is hard to beat, at least what I had.What a great and easy restaurant. It's got such a simple layout and a solid menu. The staff was really friendly and the food was delicious. The dishes were fresh and hot and they tasted authentic and made from scratch. Great spot!LAME....

As a hot dog connoisseur, I was pissed that I came here. Mainly because it's hyped up so much and did not deliver in the slightest. 

Compared to Capital Dawg in Sacramento, I was NOT impressed. 

I ordered a dog with pastrami and mustard. The mustard was all I tasted and the pastrami was weak and hell. No salty goodness, just sliced meat with no flavor. 

What a bummer. Guess I've got to stick to Capital Dawg and Costco to get my fixes!If you like chipotle you will love this place. But they don't have the vegan friendly soy option. Yet. 
The buffalo chicken is house add and fantastic. So if you're feeling like supporting a local place and feel like eating a burrito or taco that you could've gotten at chipotle this is your place. The vegetarian option currently is only sautéed vegetables but otherwise a decent place.I've been driving by Wu's and wanting to try since it opened. Went for a friends birthday. I got the calamari (which was ok did need more seasoning) and got the BLT salad and added chicken and it was great. Nice and hotI have been here many times, and each time I have been impressed with the restaurant and all it has to offer. The food here is fantastic - I highly recommend the flat breads or caesar salad for an appetizer. Also, you are missing out if you do not order the four cheese ravioli. If you come to the restaurant with a large group, they have a great family style option. However, this option is ONLY AVAILABLE for groups of four or over. Do not waste your calories\/money if your group is smaller than this - it is not worth it, and you will have to take food home.I feel very guilty downgrading this restaurant.  The kimchi chigae (with pork) had a lot of very fatty pieces, and the kimchi itself was very lacklustre, both in the ttukbegae and as part of the panchan.  The panchan dishes themselves were very uninspiring.  They had a panchan which looked like yeolmu kimchi - mixed with carrots and other vegetables, coated in a sweet, sesame oil type seasoning - odd, in all the times I've been to Korea and in Korean restaurants in general, never had this - did not appeal.  Also, on the hottest day of the year, nyengmyeon was unavailable.  Disappointing ...As far as I can tell, Glass Nickel has the best delivery-pizza in town. Not the cheapest, but it's worth it if you're at all picky, so it's my default option when it's late and there's no food in the fridge. And they've got plenty of options for customizing the pizza, so it's hard not to find something good. I've got no idea about their non-pizza items though.They have the best bread compare to lee's sandwiches  and Mr sandwiches. But the only problem they don't really put out a lot of meat inside the bread. There more focus on the veggies.This is my second favorite burger place. It's leagues above your run-of-the-mill  fastfood place. The decor centers around a 50's like diner. 

The chain used to be known as Andy's and nothing seems to be very different. The burgers are fresh and cooked to order and the bacon is real.  Although I do feel a mini heart attack every time I go but I just cant stay away.  

I wish there was more that I could say but you'll just have to try it for yourself.Good food. I especially love their chicken fried rice. Hong To's the only place I've been where the fried rice actually has the toasty complex flavor that comes from proper preparation, i.e. fried at high heat. Every other place I've ever visited makes this dish almost as an afterthought: steamed, mushy & tasteless. Portion size is good, service is cheerful and fast. Prices are reasonable.This Rosati's store is pickup or delivery only, no dine in here. I called in an order for a small Chicago style pepperoni pizza, and an order of mild wings extra crispy. The girl on the phone said 35 minutes so I drove over after 30 had passed. Unfortunately for me my food was not ready yet. I waited about 20 minutes before I received anything. At least 6 other people came into the store to pickup food, and were all told that their order was not ready yet. Granted they were busy, but they should probably add an extra 20 minutes or longer to the suggested pickup\/delivery time. It was almost an hour until I got my food from the time I called. Also I heard the girls telling people on the phone delivery time was 2 hours, yikes! No pizza is worth a two hour wait, just sayin'. 

Anyway I had asked for extra ranch before I paid and the guy who rang me up said no problem. When I got my food there was only one ranch so I asked for more and was charged $0.54 for one. I was a little bothered because the guy didn't charge me when I asked for it, and also since I waited an extra 20 minutes they should have thrown it in for free, but whatever. It cost me $30 for everything. 

The wings that I ordered were supposed to be mild were dry as hell. The pizza was okay but too doughy and not enough sauce. I like the concept of Chicago style deep dish, but whenever I order it I am always disappointed. It's just too doughy for me. I wouldn't order from here again.This place is great and gets more diverse crowd than any other place in Pittsburgh. The layout is good, drinks are cool and music is just great. The place is great place to chill out and is not as crazy as south side or station square. 

This place is a hit or miss though. Some days you get lot of fun people and on other days, it is deserted. 

The cover on weekend is mostly $5 though on some special event days, it is $10. 

Overall, AVA is one of the most underrated place in Pittsburgh for night out.Food is over sized so make sure you share with someone. Food is great and not greasyI've been here twice now, once for breakfast and once for lunch. To be honest, I don't really understand the hype... it's just okay food with kinda quirky servers. 

My most recent visit, I got a #5 burger topped with chili, cheese, and slaw. They have a lunch special of meatloaf and mashed potatoes, so I asked if I could substitute the chips that normally come with a burger for the mashed potatoes. They said they would see if that was an option. If not, I told them, I'll be fine with pasta salad. I'm not sure what they consider MASHED potatoes... but I ended up with hash-brown-like grated potatoes mixed with butter\/cream like you would do with mashed. 

They forgot to bring the slaw for my burger, which was fine. The burger itself was quite thick, at least 3\/4", but slightly over-cooked. I can't say it was the worst burger I've ever had, but certainly not close to one the best you can find in Charlotte. 

My lunch companions, however, seemed to really enjoy their meals. The one who requested we come here for her birthday had a pancake, eggs, and bacon. She said they have "the best bacon", so maybe I should've tried something that included that... 

Overall, unless someone REALLY wanted to come here (and it was their birthday), I would not choose to come back.This is a chain restaurant, expensive and popular.  Our party enjoyed the food and the service was good- for a lower priced "eat and run" place.  The servers started to remove food plates seconds after one person appeared to be finished, instead of waiting for all to finish before collecting them.  A fine restaurant, such as Fleming's purports to be,  would wait.  I personally had to rebuff 3 attempts to remove my plate.  If I wanted to eat at a "feed 'em and street 'em" place, I would go to a place like Yours Truly.Super stoked on our stay at the Rio.  We came in late, after a 10 hour drive, and were super pleased with Registration.  They guy was nice, they processed us quickly and for no reason, they gave us a complimentary upgrade to a suite! We were blown away!  It was amazing. The view was amazing. It was super spacious, the master bathroom was so awesome with a jet spa\/bath tub!! We left early, so we didn't experience the pool, but it looked amazing. We're not smokers and the Casino smelled fresh. Super stoked with the Rio!!I love their food here! I'm a big gyro fan and their gyro is fantastic. I've gotten rice before here and it has an interesting spice that makes it have a little kick and I love that. Also their lunch combo for gyro is very affordable. Very nice service.Very disappointed.  

The place looked fun and interesting but it was all a let down from there.

The hostess was cold and standoffish.  Flopped our menus on the table and left.  

The waitress was friendly but odd about drink options, offered tap water and left.   

The menu choices looked dismal.  Lots of good options for drinks, But that's about it.  No burritos or fajitas.  Tacos and odd plates only. N waited forever and finally threw down a few bucks for the tap water we didn't drink and walked out.

Headed next door for a delicious meal and good drinks.  

Will never go back.When I first heard that this was going to be part of the Doh group, I wasn't that particularly interested in trying it. I've tried their Doh AYCE sushi location in Chinatown and it didn't exactly amaze me and I'm not a fan of Tofu Hut either. However, I was just craving some Korean BBQ meats and I didn't want to drive all the way to Chinatown for it, so my boyfriend and I decided to give Doh a try. 

The interior is definitely cute. It is very clean and organized inside. They have about three round tables that can sit 4-5 people. They're not huge round tables so they actually remind me of the small round tables that you'll see in Hong Kong street stalls. They have three "booths" along the side of the wall -- well they're more like a box in the wall where you can sit.. kind of cute. The vents that they have are pretty amazing. The vents are adjustable so it's lowered all the way down to just above the grill but it will get in your way of staring at your partner. After your meal, you are able to adjust it back up so it won't be in your face. Best part? You don't leave the restaurant smelling like KBBQ. WIN! I LIKE IT. 

If you are here for AYCE, you have two options: $19.95 or $23.95. The $23.95 dinner allows you to order the rib eye steak but it is one order per person. Now, you are completely allowed to do what we did: I ordered the $19.95 dinner and my boyfriend ordered the $23.95 dinner so we shared the rib eye. Because, let's be real, we don't have the stomach to eat two rib eyes AND everything else. 

The banchan included kimchi, ddukbokki, macaroni salad, and pickled daikon. The kimchi was delicious. It was so delicious that we even got a second serving of it. It was probably some of the best kimchi I've had here in Vegas. It was also a nice addition to be able to have some ddukbokki considering that it's not part of your usual banchan combo. They also had a huge bowl of salad as well. 

Everyone got a salt\/pepper & sesame oil sauce for meat dipping, which I LOVE. In many places, I usually have to ask for this but they auto gave it to everyone here! They also give you fermented soybean paste, which I don't use but I appreciate the thought. Then they also have a small side of garlic and jalapenos, and I definitely ate those. It definitely shows that they're pretty traditional with their condiments. 

We ended up ordering brisket, beef tongue, kalbi, pork belly, and steamed egg. Let me begin by telling you that their portions are no joke. This isn't Gen BBQ where they give you 4-5 pieces of kalbi and beef tongue per order. They gave a plate full of brisket, a plate full of beef tongue, three strips of kabi, and we had to ask them to only give us one strip of pork belly. 

Their brisket was normal. Beef tongue was a bit on the chewier side but still good. The kalbi was really good -- the marinate wasn't intensely sweet. Pork belly was also decent. Their egg was pretty fluffy and it would go great with rice. 

The service was excellent. They would often check up on us and was able to answer every one of our questions. If we had no meat to cook, they would ask if we would like to order more meat. Wonderful :) 

Overall, I think Doh is pretty good. At their price point, it is definitely better than a lot of KBBQ places in Las Vegas. The only downside is their lack of variety .. however, I typically only eat brisket and beef tongue during KBBQ so it is definitely not a downside for me. Their meat quality is definitely not the best but not the worst either. 

I would definitely be back. Count on it.It was our first time here.  It's actually a much bigger place than I expected. We went on a Thursday night so we expected it to be a little slow. But surprisingly there were quite a few people there and the appropriate number of staff to attend to all the tables. 
We didn't order any apps since we didn't want it to be too late a night. Most of our group enjoyed the food. I ordered the butternut squash agnolotti. Ohh em gee! Soo good! Definitely get this if you go. 
The service was pretty slow considering the number of people there. One thing that I didn't like much was that the waitress didn't really offer any suggestions when asked. I usually like getting the staff suggestions since they've usually tried much of the food. But oh well! 
Overall, do give this place a go. It's a great spot :)It's not a Vietnamese restaurant, they only imitate Vietnamese foods. Therefore it's easy to understand why the Pho and other Vietnamese foods here are tasted so bad. Also the waitress there is really rude, she put the glass of water on the table hard enough that it splashed all over my friends and on the table, then she asked for more tips... I mean, it's bloody terrible the service.Everytime I'm in Las Vegas, I hit Earl of Sandwich.  Always a great sandwich.  I like the Full Montague best.  They're open 24 hours which is always a good thing in Vegas.  Best thing is that it's very cheap for food on the strip.  Try it out.Full disclosure: I'm not even that into Mexican. However, I get cravings for this place! 

It's that kind of good!!!Love having this place in the city! Quality food all around. Staff is friendly and food comes out pretty quick!Judging by the other reviews, maybe we were here on a really great day, but my boyfriend and I truly had such a wonderful time that we came here twice in one weekend. We were home visiting my parents for Memorial Day but did 1 night at the Aria. After checking in we wanted a quick bite but didn't want to ruin our appetites for Hakkasan later so popped over here on a recommendation from the front desk agent. Obviously Todd English has a renowned reputation and resume to match, but judge this for what it is, a casual pub with a luxurious twist. He already has a 5-star elegant restaurant on the strip at Bellagio, Olives, so why compare? 

It's a fun atmosphere with outdoor seating in front of the pond outside Crystals shopping center and the Aria lobby. Inside is decked out with red leather booths, a large circular bar, and expansive tables. They have a sports theme and happy hour deals, so we ordered the wings which were a dollar a piece and were really really yummy. The perfect blend of crispy and tender, spicy and mild, dunked in blue cheese sauce. Then we split a lobster cobb salad which I believe is one of their signature items for good reason. We both had huge portions even though we split one order, and they were very generous with the lobster. 

The next morning all of the breakfast places at Aria were teeming with lines of tourists and we just weren't in the mood so we came back here! I had a dish that I may have possibly come up with in a dream:

Bagel tacos (shell made from crispy thin bagel slices) filled with scrambled eggs, lox, sour cream, and caviar, served with a side of mixed greens tossed in a champagne vinaigrette. Whoaaaaaaaaa buddy this was amazing. T had a corned beef hash topped with poached eggs that was served in a personal sized cast iron skillet.

There were women walking around who were literally busting, BUSTING, out of their red gingham bustiers hawking customized bloody marys which were pretty cool. We didn't order any but they had a paper checklist and you could add everything from herbs, peppers, onions, veggies, to oysters, lobster claws, bacon strips, etc. Would absolutely go back next time I'm in town! Casual atmosphere with excellent food.The Stratosphere has got to be one of the best values in Vegas. On the real. I booked a trip through Expedia, and my round trip cost for three nights and airfare was approximately $270 a person. Seriously, you can't beat that.

It's true, the Strat is on the far end of the Strip and quite the walk to all the true draws of Vegas. But, it has a great many benefits that I think make it a worthwhile hotel stay - not just including the price. The rooms are fairly basic, which might be a drawback to some, but I think it's to be expected considering its cost. Everything was clean, well maintained, and up to snuff. Really, if you're coming to Vegas to spend all your time in the room and you need frills and opulence, you've got different priorities than me. 

While it's true that it is not in the best looking part of town, I never felt unsafe or at risk in any way, even while walking my way to the main part of the Strip. Having said that, I wouldn't recommend making that walk because it's a LOT further than you think it is. Get a bus pass. 

Hotel staff were all friendly, courteous, and seemed to know their stuff. They had plenty of recommendations on restaurants, other non-gambling\/show things to do, and were very willing to accommodate any requests I had. They even watched my bags for the majority of the day on which I left as my flight didn't take off until 10pm and checkout was at 11am. For a small fee of $30, I was able to get a late check out of 3pm, but that still left me 7 hours to burn and I didn't want to lug my small backpack around.

The casino is definitely not as large as those further down the Strip, but the table games can be found with LOW minimums. I'm talking $5 blackjack. As someone who is not a huge gambler, I found this to be awesome and a great way to break yourself in. Plenty of slots too and more than enough eating options right in the hotel (although they may not be everyone's bag... I'll try to do separate reviews for those that I visited).

One additional perk of being a guest of the Stratosphere is being able to get to the top of the tower at no additional cost. The rides are definitely not my kind of thing, I don't even do rollercoaster that are on the ground let alone hundreds of feet off the ground on top of a tower, but the views from the observation deck and atop the tower are killer and can't be beat. Even if you're not staying here, I'd say it's worth the trip to get to the top at night and scope out the Strip from above. It might be even better on mind altering substances... not that I would know anything about that or those.

Yes, there are plenty of nicer, more expensive, more recently updated options in Vegas. But the Stratosphere suits me just fine and I had a great time there. For the cost, it can't be beat and I am sure I'll find myself staying here again in the not so distant future.Quality of food was solid but not amazing. No pancakes was a bummer. It was just right for brunch. Short ribs Benedict and salmon Benedict were both good.This review is kind a tale of two aspects of the restaurant.  Let's start with the positive - the food (which is what you come here for in the first place).  And it was awesome.  Our group had the breakfast croissant sandwich (with scrambled eggs and ham), the eggs benedict and a short stack of pancakes. Everything was great.  The sandwich had perfectly prepared eggs with melty cheese and flavorful ham.  The croissant was huge and delicious.  Just the right amount of flakiness. The short stack of pancakes were perfectly done and delicious.  As for the benedict, it was awesome.  The hollandaise sauce was excellent, the eggs were perfect.  Just delicious.  With the exception of the short stack, the dishes came with excellent seasoned potatoes.  Easily five-star food and one of the top two breakfast meals we've had since moving here last year. 

Now the negative - the service.  Our waitress was really clueless, while drinks were served promptly, after our order was taken the waitress disappeared for like 10 minutes and then came back to tell us she forgot to put the order in.  We got a half-hearted apology, but clearly it amused her too because she giggled throughout.  So she walks over to the machine and starts typing in the order, then has to flee back because she can't read what she wrote down for one of the order.  Our food did come out fairly quickly after that, but she dropped the plates off in a hurry and wandered off before I could even tell her that we had no silver ware. So we had to wait for her to wander back to get that.  I realize that everyone has bad days and mistakes happen, but the sheer volume of screw ups here was unacceptable.  One-star (at best) for the service.  

Given that great food and abominable service, I'm going to split the difference and give Cracked Egg 3 stars.  I'm sure we will be back at some point, because the food was great, but the service was certainly concerning.Abject disappointment is what best describes the whole of this experience, beginning with a Friday night happy only lasting until 5:30.
Imagine that. 
I'd happily slogged down on beer when last call cast its gloomy shadow. 
[Quick, another beer and some appetizers before the cutoff. "WAITER!"]

Me:  Uh, I'll have another 8th St and an order of the
        happy hour chips and guacamole.

Waiter: speaking uncannily like Bill Lumbergh from Office Space:
      "Yeahhhh, nooooo, the guac isn't part of the happy hour menu 
       anymore. 
       It's a side order for $9.99".

Me: (looking perplexed, thinking, what the fuck?)  "WHAT THE FUCK?" (nice inflection on the 
       fuck)
       
Waiter: Yeahhhh, sorrrry

Me:  Alright, bring another beer and I'll have my order ready when you get back

Beer arrives - time is 5:30.

Waiter: Are you ready to order?

DM:  Yep. Eleven more beers, the happy hour ribs, the happy hour shrimp, and 
         the happy hour Arizona egg rolls. 
         And get my wife seven pomegranate martinis, an order of ribs, a water, three 
         glasse of ice and about thirty napkins.

Wife: Have you lost your fucking mind? Two hours from now you'll be 
        sawing logs on the family room floor and I'll be watching Dateline - again -
        by myself. 
        WE'RE LEAVING, NOW!

Me:   [sore from impromptu neutering]   Yeah - just bring the check


Our beloved White Chocolate Grill has, like so many other restaurants of its ilk succumbed to cheaping-out on happy hour; overcharging for popular menu items, and featuring surly waiters.
If this was 1920's Alabama, I'd  have shot him, thrown him in my pit barbecue and feed him to local law enforcement officials at their annual picnic.

White Chocolate:
I've been patiently waiting for this joyous time of year when snowbirds flock to their cool summer abodes -  just like rats jumping off a sinking freighter. 
This is when I come knocking, so I can have you all to myself. 
And you pull this shit?

DISCLAIMER

1.) I'd just finished watching Office Space before heading out for happy hour.
      Bill Lundbergh was everywhere.

2.) I wouldn't really shoot anyone like the girl in Fried Green Tomatoes. I would
     however give them a savage tongue lashing. (not the Michael Douglas variety)

3.) My balls are detachable in situations such as this - neutering isn only temporary

4.) I wish I'd taken the Rodeo Clown career path. 
     Being gored a few hundred times would  beat this life I'm living.

5.) Mrrrrrrr.This is one of my favorite places to go for lunch.  The fish sandwich is amazing and the service is always fantastic.  My personal favorite is the fish sandwich however, I have never ordered anything here that I didn't like.I'm going to cut to the chase and tell you the Belgian Waffle was outstanding! You are probably thinking, why I got Waffles at a Pancake joint, right? To be honest, I was going to order pancakes but judging how they looked from other people's plates, it seemed less appealing!  Kind of plain and boring, if you would.

I had no regrets! The 4-inch diameter waffle was thick, moist, and had enough crisp around the edges! For an additional $2, I opted to add some fresh cut strawberries! Finish it off with some in-house syrup and butter, you got yourself a breakfast of champions! ($8)

As for the Hash Brown, the shredded potatoes were crisped perfectly at the top while the inner part was fresh tasting! ($2)

I washed all that down with a large glass of sweet, yet delicious orange juice!  This was probably the best fresh squeeze I've ever had. ($5)

The meal was not heavy and portioned appropriately to keep you away from an afternoon nap.  

Our server was knowledgeable about the menu and operated as efficient as she could as the restaurant was at full capacity. 

All in all, I would rate my experience as mostly positive with one caveat: the wait.  Expect a wait and steep bill!Great food and even better service. Ross was incredible, took care of us and went beyond service. Thank you!!Omg I love this place.  It is my go-to lunch destination.  I get the BBQ pork Banh Mi sandwich at least once a week. I've had Banh Mi from other places and let me tell you this one is the best.  The bread is toasty warm and they put more meat than any of the other places in Vegas.  And let me tell you ...The pickled veggies are deeeelish!!  I've done both take-out and eat-in.  I call my order in when I leave my office and its ready for pickup.  And the best of it is the locals get a discount!!!!This place has one of the best beer menus in Vegas, and its food is equally as good. We recently had the poutine, the lamb meatballs, and the pork belly sandwich, and all were fantastic. Highly recommended.I love this place.  $5 mimosas and happy hour drink prices?  Awesome!  I have had the different brushettas here - the marscapone & fig, salami & pesto, and smoked salmon ones being some of my favorites.  I've also had the mini grilled cheese appetizers (so GOOD), the big plate appetizer (can't remember the name but it comes with hummus, cheeses, and prosciutto and salamis) and the old burratta plate.  Very, very good.  I am a huge cheese, wine, and brushetta person so this place is literally my heaven.  The only thing I'm knocking a star off for is the staff.  I've been there a few times and some of the staff could be rude and snobby, and one instance that irked me was when I talked to the server about adding burratta to my order, he basically charged me for the whole plate (burratta, olives, salamis, etc) and didn't add it on to the big appetizer plate, like I thought he would.  No big deal, I just wished that he would have explained it was a separate appetizer plate since we had so much food!  Overall, still my favorite place in Phoenix.One of the better Korean places in the area, everything they send out looks really appetizing.  Pork bone soup is a classic and is really good here.  They also don't make a big deal about refiling side dishes like some other Korean places in the area.  On top of that its 24 hours which makes it extra convenient.Valentines day!!! Not worth my $25.99
Service was okay at first, but on the later part our Filipina server was trying to kick us out as soon as we paid the bill. Very rude to paying customers...we work in the hospitality industry and thats not how it works..
Not worth to give that $15 tip...
I will never ever go back to this place again...Whenever we are in Las Vegas we go eat at Fresh Kabob great food nice tender Chicken Kabobs and basmati rice the sauces excellent.Wow! 
Randomly dropped by for dinner before a show.  It looked good enough.  You can never tell what you're gonna get at these Vegas joints.  Apparently people that visit here are wild about soggy croissants.  
I was alone so I sat at the bar.  Asked for an entree and wine recommendation.  The bartender was super friendly (and nice to look at).  My food came out quickly.  I had fries, crab stuffed shrimp, and a glass of white wine.  It was absolutely amazing.  One of the best meals I've had in a long time.  And I live in San Francisco.  I have high standards when it comes to food.  To top it off I actually felt the price was a bargain with all things considered.
At one point at lady sat next to me.  She was in a hurry.  And the bartender did everything in his control to accommodate her and get her out as quickly as possible.  He was so friendly and professional.  
I honestly can't wait to come back to this place.  Hands down one of the highlights of my trip.  Thanks Joe's!Pros: very reasonable price, espeically if you use the yelp 2 for 1 deal! Server was quick with drinks. Xmas sweet decorations wete real and very cute.best mac and cheese ever!
Cons: apart from the mac and cheese, quality of food was pretty poor. Edible but not that great. And why have a server at a buffet?!? I suppose its good for employment statistics but we couldve got our own drinsk very easily and not had to tip!Came there with high expectations but was disappointed in their food, especially the drink. I ordered a cocktail Lychee Chu Hi, it tasted just like lychee juice diluted with water, couldn't taste any liquor. If you go for there food is fine, but not the drink!My friend and I went there for happy hour. The bartender introduced himself and continued to call us by our names for the entire evening. Shows that he pays attention and wants to make people comfortable. In addition, he mixes great drinks. We ordered 4 appetizers and shared. Fresh blue point oysters on the half shell, so fresh and big. Shrimp cocktail with really big shrimp. Again, everything tasted so fresh. Shrimp toast was yummy and softshell crabs were a winner as well.This is the best fast food you can get. If you're a fast foodie, In-N-Out is the place to go. Any In-N-Out is a great choice, but this location stands out. It's always busy, very busy. The drive thru is actually shaped in a zig zag pattern so they can fit more cars, and they need it. Unfortunately you better be prepared to wait, but it's worth it and any place that's that busy, is a very good sign. The double double with onions is amazing. The animal fries, amazing. This is probably the only fast food restaurant that isen't fast, and is worth waiting for. Right next door is a In-N-Out retail store if you want to buy any shirts, or anything like that. Mabie it's a corporate office, not sure. Anyways, GO!!!!Their food is so good, we are luck they are so close to our home. Delivery is the fastest of any place we've ever ordered from, Thai or any other type of food. We've been coming here for years & we love the guy that does their deliveries, he so nice & quick to get here. The food is always consistently made & tastes amazing. Highly recommended!!!So... the only reason why I ended up eating here is because I thought it would be the quickest place to grab a bite before heading to a show at the Convention Center. 
-Food: They have a wide selection but no one in my party of 3 were complimenting the food. In fact, my lobster pasta upset my stomach. :(
-Prices: High for the quality
-Ambiance: Nothing to write home about (there are way better places in Vegas)
-Staff: It took longer than expected to be seated and then to get our order taken. The waitress was friendly though. 
-Location: It's conveniently in the Westgate Hotel and walking distance of the Convention Center. 
-Overall: Try someplace else...Being local to Belmont, I really WANT to like this place.  Given it several tries over the years and it is just OK.  Food is okay.  Service is good.  Atmosphere is loud.  They do have a great bar and beer selection but unless you are going just to drink I'd skip it, there are better places to eat in town.Tasty broth!! I don't like the selection of Vietnamese restaurants in Calgary these days but these guys don't disappoint!! One word of caution though - you may get the MSG after affects. It might be why their ph broth is so tasty. But the meat in the ph is good and not dry like many other places. It's worth a try if you're not "allergic" to MSG. (As I finish this review I have finally fully perked up after my long nap from my MSG induced slumber. Yes, I did so happen to eat here for lunch earlier today.)Large portions and friendly, but a little slow service.Best night of karaoke ever. Crowd was great with many good singers. Mac, chocolate Thunder, is a super DJ - gets people up dancing, sings and super fun guy. Chris, the bartender, besides making great drinks, is an entertainer himself. You will not lead disappointed!!!!!I have been coming to Blanco's for a few years now. We have never had a bad meal there and the service is always very good. If you like spicy then be sure and ask for their Habanero salsa. I like it a little better than the regular salsa. Depending on who made it, it can be a little hot! Another "tip" is buy the Fox Restaurant gift cards at Costco and use that to pay. Saves you 20%!Bored on a weekend we decided finding it as a top burger spot in Montreal. It was absolutely amazing. Best burger I've had in years. 

I had a cheeseburger and a poutine. Their fries and gravy sauce was top notch.

We walked in not knowing if we have to sit or order upfront. It was a bit slow too. Can't blame them though, it was a Friday. Besides that the service was excellent.

Will be going again as soon as I can.Honestly, why does this place exist. The hostess is lousy and so are the wait staff. The place was pretty empty when my friends and I went. There was an event for piano dueling and one of my friend wanted to go and see. We were going to have a couple of beers and an appetizer then head on to dinner afterwards. The hostess said that we have to wait at least 10 minutes for a table. We only had a party of five and there were bar tables and long tables unoccupied. We waited anyhow and we were showed to our table.  He ID'd everyone because you have to be 18 and over when you're in the pub. We were ordering our drink and I told our waiter, Timothy, that I was sick and I did not want to drink alcohol. I asked if he had any other drinks other than beer and he gave me an attitude by saying "do you mean non-alcoholic drinks?" After that happened, i ended ordering the ice tea, my friend ordered a sweet bear, two miller lites, and a pear cider. We also ordered the Chili Garlic chicken wings because Timothy suggested it and it was edible. Nothing I would go running back for and definitely would not beg to eat. The way he gave us our food is the most aggravating part. Like I said, I ordered the tea and he slammed down the sugar next to me and the tea. He proceeded with tossing me the straw. The worst server I have ever encounter. I was wondering why it was so slow because they had an event going. I figured it was because of the night club goers, but it's just the horrible customer service. He slammed every drink and our appetizer. I asked him for napkins because I was sick and my nose was running, but he took his sweet time getting it for me. We kept trying to get his attention to ask him for to get another order for my friend's food and another cider, but he's not attentive whatsoever. We finally got his attention and he responded with "got it." I don't understand why you would open a business just to watch it fail with your employees but it is their business. It was also difficult getting the check. Our bill came out to be around 50~. We gave him our card and he came back with it. I expected a "thank you and have a great night" and what I actually got was "just sign it and leave it there" we tipped out of courtesy, but we were bitter about it. I doubt that they will survive because one of the yelpers explained that it actually changed to a pub, but they would not get any money from me anymore. 

Bottom line: Even if you want to grab a bite and thought about this place, just go to McDonalds. If you wanted to drink, just go to the casino and order the drink then tip the cocktail waitress. Avoid at all cost.So far in the area, this is my favorite Asian restaurant. I mostly get chicken dishes. Tasty and filling. People at the restaurant are very friendly. I always see other Asian people eating here, which I take as a good sign.An extensive wine list by region, you can find something for anyone! Food is good, but the food on happy hour is even betterTom's Urban was recommended by a friend of mine. It did not disappoint. Really good menu and the prime rib sliders were the shizz. (That's teenager slang for "good.") But most of all our server Miranda was frickin awesome. I said we should be best friends. She seemed hesitant. But I get it. It's Vegas after all. She needs to be cautious. 

I am concerned that the road trip sandwiches are available as a dine-in option. Feels like false advertising. But that's just politics.I have only had one lunch meal here - the thali. I can surely say their menu is reasonably priced but, the taste of the food is below average. The meats were indeed cooked to perfection but, the just wasn't great. Very controlled use of oil\/fat which is another plus. I will update this as I try a couple more items.This place is one of my favourites 

It looks like a hole in the wall but it's fantastic 

Only issue today it was pretty salty 

But regularly it's proper

EDIT: I have a fish allergy and I told them to make sure my
Food didn't get contaminated. It did! A 7$ meal turned into a 300$ meal (epi Pens are expensive) I won't be back just for that factor I thought something was off when I was eating my pho didn't notice the reaction till half way throughWe were out with out of town visitors and went for the Tapas option everything was awesome. The food, vibe. The service
Can't wait to go back.If you are coming for weekend brunch, beware of long wait! Our party of 3 came here at noon on a Saturday and we waited for an hour.  The good thing is, while you wait, you can step over to Nash bagel to pick up some freshly baked bagel. 

The menu is fairly simple with typical dishes such as omelette and egg bennies.  The average price around $14 which is quite reasonable.  I ordered the egg white frittata but it looked more like just an egg white omelette which I was a bit disappointed however, the taste was quite good.  I also like the deep fried root veggie that comes with every dish.  That same can't be said for the coffee tho, it wasn't very good, had a very water down taste.Oh dear lord no. My bar isn't that high for fast chinese food, and this place is by my house, but I'm not coming back. Tonight, we ordered lo mein, vegetable egg rolls, and ma po tofu (hold the beef). Our lo mein was similar to the picture posted - weirdly gray. 2 of the 4 egg rolls were fine, but the other 2 were white and powdery inside.  I didn't even know that was possible. They weren't cold, just powdery. The ma po tofu had beef (despite requesting none) and a hair. 

Ew.I really enjoy Chopt salads, and I much prefer to order ahead using their app. The app is great, and if you use it then your salad is ready when you arrive!

They have tons of topping options, dressings, meats, etc. The salads always taste fresh, and the portions are large.

I typically order the Cobb salad and then I sub falafel for the chicken, and I exclude the cheese and bacon. This is another reason I like Chopt - make all the modifications you like!Lots of harsh reviews but I'm a local and I depend heavily on this store and I like it.  They always have really good deals some of the things I get a lot of: e.g. peanut butter, canned tomatoes.  It's not the greatest place to buy a green bell pepper, but I'm still happy going there.Best thai food in Arizona so far!   Pad thai and Tom ka soup were wonderful.   Nice decor and wait staff.  Fresh well cooked vegetables.We had a fantastic meal here.  I am a vegetarian (though I will eat some fish).  My two dining companions eat most anything -- as long as it's beautifully prepared.  We are all competent cooks, so it takes a lot to impress us.  

Sparrow + Wolf WOWED us!   We shared a bunch of plates including a special of caviar on toast (maybe my favorite all night).  Also had a hummus plate and a hamachi tartar with rice crisps that was amazingly flavored.  They had a couple of meat dishes that they loved.  

If I return to Las Vegas, I will surely return here. The food was great...the staff was great...the vibe was great.The good:
I have tried the Chicken Tikka Masala with Naan and Basmati Rice. Also, tried somosas. It was very good. 

Very Spacious, good for conversations and privacy. Nice and tasteful Interiors. Looks new and very clean.

Apart from food, I like the songs bollywood songs playing in the background which I dont get to listen a lot these days.

The owner is a very hospitable person, hence this review :)

The bad:
If you go alone, it can be a little expensive. All the times I have been there, there isn't much crowd and so for people who enjoy, people watching, not the best option, but if you like quiet and private kind of evening, its great.

Buffet can be little better. Would have liked more TVs. 

Overall, its worth a try and a great optionloved the food, the service and that they are enviromentaly conscienceI had the thanksgiving sandwich and sweet potato fries. They were both mighty tasty; overpriced, but tasty. 

The service SUCKED. Never received the sauce I asked for. Twice. Had to ask for a water refill - never offered to refill drinks. Ugh. Boo. Blah. Won't come back. 

Also it was very difficult to access and had no restrooms on site. Save yourself the bother and $80 and just eat at In N Out.Very nice bar. Great food. Bands play here on certain night. Good place to come and chiil and grab a beer and eat some food and watch a game.We went on Sunday night for dinner for the first time. We were a big family (10 people plus a toddler). We  made very last minute reservations and they accommodated is to a private room. 1st off I'd like to say that it is VERY rare that we leave a restaurant and everyone in my family is happy. Generally I feel bad for places we go to when we are in a group because they can all be high maintenance. With that said I'm giving  5 stars because this is one of those places that hit almost everything perfectly. The staff was friendly and the food and cocktails were great! I generally steer clear of craft cocktails because most places try to hard to make them taste so fancy and they ruin the alcohol. But this place was on point. We all got different ones and they were all good. Word to the wise: even though the entree portions say serves 2-4 it's really a personal portion. 2-4 servings is if you are ordering family style. We also ordered the bone marrow which was amazing but you only really get 4 bites total for about $16 (?) So not really worth the money on that one. The fried chicken of course is a must, and the grits were some of the best I had. So excited to come back on our next trip.The service is terrible every. single. time. Even when it is not crowded, I find myself waiting and waiting for service. The food is decent, but I would suggest Emiliano's down the street instead.Can't believe it.  Went into Subway (where I've gone many times), looked at the menu while two waitresses stood at the counter.  Nobody else was in the restaurant.  Was finally ready to order, looked at each of the waitresses and smiled.  One girl nudged the other, "are you going to wait on her?"   "In a minute," replied the other as she gave me a sneer.  I continued to stand there.  Finally, I said, "Is somebody going to wait on me?"  "In a minute," replied the waitress again .  The girl who nudged her went to the back.  So I stood there some more.  After a good 10 minutes, she came over.  I told her I wanted two steak and cheese 6" sandwiches.  Told her what kind of bread, cheese, toasted, lettuce, tomatoes and onions with ranch dressing.  She got everything I wanted except the ranch dressing.  Then she announced that they didn't have any ranch dressing.  I don't like my subs without ranch and I asked her to check again.  She went to the back, but in less than a minute, returned, "Nope.  Don't got any ranch."  Well, guess what.  I said, "I don't want the sandwiches then."  Whatever happened to customer service?  I wouldn't have left her with the sandwiches already prepared if she'd been nice to me.  She didn't even smile.The pizza here is pretty decent, but man today when its raptors game 7 they messed up.  I suppose theres mad orders going out but damn they gave me raw chicken bites, knowing myself i'll be turned off chicken for months.

The pizza was cold.My family have been ordering large lasagnas from this place for 20+ years . Somehow 9 of us ended up here . So old, so tired ! We were warmly greeted by the server who was likely the manager . He was the high point .
The rice balls ( arancini ) were oily and stale . My fish in paper was beyond awful . Tiny overcooked portion . The chicken puttanesca was OK but quite dry . Very likely reheated . Other dishes were also poor . 
No salt and pepper on the tables, no glasses of water but strangely lots of fruit flies . Frankly the food deserved a 1 star but the service and the memory of their lasagna " earned" it an extra star .The restaurant was accommodating when we asked for the dinner menu at lunch. Steaks were outstanding the New York Strip bone-in was so tender and flavorful.What's better than pho after staying out until 4 am partying your brains out? Not only that but you're partying in VEGAS! Pho Kim Long is literally the biggest pho restaurant I've ever seen. The line can build up, so be prepared for that.

Pho Tai ($7.75)
Awesome broth!! Noodles and rare steak are great, but I HIGHLY recommend adding meatballs to any pho you get. Probably the best meatball in pho I've had.

Egg Rolls ($6.50)
How can you order pho without egg rolls. I recommend the egg rolls as well. Nice little appetizer before your hangover meal.

Next time after partying at Marquee or Hakkasan, I'm coming here the morning after.After having made the saucy mistake of trying to just walk in for Saturday brunch around noon (and then facing an hour+ wait time), I returned months later right at 10am on A Saturday right when the place opens. Our party of 2 got seated effortlessly and immediately. 

Beastwich: the brunch version has a fried egg added but the winner is the fried chicken thigh and the melty biscuit. There's PLENTY of gravy but it doesn't smother the sandwich, which I appreciate.

Found the French press coffee a little bland.I have to say, the guys who work here are FANFRICKINTASTICAL. The pizza just isn't my style. Part of me wishes it were because the guys who work there went way above and beyond. 

I ordered pizza on a Friday night. I asked them if they had Dr. Pepper and the guy said, "Oh man, we don't and it's my ALL TIME FAV!"

When the delivery dude showed up at my door he had a special Dr. Pepper for me. Folks, they went to the store and got me Dr. Pepper. I gave him a $10 tip and said holy cow, best service ever. I felt like royalty. 

I might give them another shot solely based on the amazing customer service.A delightful and elegant Chinese restaurant located adjacent to the lagoon in front of the Bellagio.  Having been to China, I can attest to the authenticity of the decor.  The restaurant also features floor-to-ceiling windows, offering an unmatched view of the fountains.  The service was extremely attentive but unintrusive, as I've come to expect from the Bellagio.  Now, for the food.  We ordered a wide array of dishes, as there were 10 of us.  The lemon chicken stood out more than anything else, as did the sweet and sour pork.  Both were among the best I've ever had, artistically presented, and not at all heavy (none of the food was greasy or heavy, which Americanized Chinese cuisine generally is).  Some other highlights were the Mongolian beef (spicy and tender), and the Crème Brulee, which was presented in one of the most creative ways I've ever seen.  If you're going to have one nice meal in Vegas, I'd skip Jasmine, because you can find delicious and authentic Chinese food in most major cities, but if you're a diehard fan of this cuisine and want an elegant alternative to more traditional fare, give Jasmine a try.Just like every other Chipotle, but I fee like the portions just keep getting smaller and smaller...The restaurant is well decorated and lit, very nice space. Reminds me of a hotel restaurant. Though the sushi was good, I wouldn`t say it blew me away. 

My party had the shrimp tempura and BBQ squid to start, both good options. The tempura came out hot and crunchy, with the expected tempura sauce. The BBQ squid was served on a sizzling plate and was quite nice in terms of the texture and mouth feel.

I won`t list all the rolls we had but honestly it`s the same sushi here that you`ll find anywhere else in the city. However, I will say that the portion size was good considering the price of the rolls and we all came away quite full.Soft serve ice cream was whipped with lots of air . Small cone was $3.00. Decent flavor, but it's just soft serve.
   I got a cyclone ( similar to blizzard). There was very little peanut butter cup mixed in... Disappointing. Mostly a tourist place, high prices, basic food....high profit.I'm at different restaurants daily with my job. Reds has a great atmosphere and amazing staffI wish more Italian restaurants were like this. When it comes to homestyle cooking, this place is the real deal.Went to Customshop for anniversary dinner last night.  We were not disappointed!  Our server was very attentive and answered all our questions.  The recommended wine was great and she served a generous pour. I had the pork chop which was awesome and my husband raved about the ribeye.  We will definitely go back.Don't tell anyone back East that I had a Chicago-style pizza last night!  I'll lose a pinky or end up buried in the Meadowlands.
What I like about Oregano's is the freshness.  We ordered the deep-dish, Chicago-style pizza and they warned us that it would take 45 minutes.  Hey, fine with me.  So, to bide the time, we got cheesy bread.  This thing was about 2 feet long!  It came out in a bread basket, but was hanging over the ends.  That's how long it was.  Hey, I'm single.  I pay attention to length.
There are a million different ingredients you can put on your pizza.  We had mushrooms (you can choose regular or portabella), onions (white, carmelized or red), green peppers and jalapenos.  It came out loaded with cheese and topped with sauce.  I like that.  It made the veggies and cheese all melted together and then topped with sauce.  I could only have one piece.  
I didn't stay for the pazookie.  One of these days, I will.  
The service was excellent.  We had a table outside (it had stopped raining) near the heaters.  The manager even gave me a blankie to put on my lap.Located across the street from EOS Gym, Hi Coffee is a family owned restaurant that specializes in quality Kona coffee. Like many of the students that frequent this establishment, I first came here looking for a quiet place to drink a good cup of coffee and get some school work done. I didn't realize that after my initial visit, I would soon become a regular!

Location: Like I stated above, it is located across the street from the EOS Gym on Stephanie and the 215. It doesn't look like much from the outside, but the inside is very spacious. Though I am not from the islands of Hawaii, there is something about the pastel blue walls and bright wooden floors that makes it feel like home.

Service: From the workers to the owners themselves, I have never had a bad experience with their service. The owners will regularly walk up to various tables and ask to see if everything was to your liking. Seeing the relationships they all have with the regulars shows how much of a genuine connection they strive to have with every person that walks through their doors. Recently, they added a rewards system for anyone who wants it. I believe it is $.10 earned for every $1.00 spent to redeem later on. With the amount of times I come here, this will surely come in handy!

Food: So many options! This establishment specializes in 100% Kona coffee. Their cold brew is one of the strongest I have ever had. It kept me awake and alert all day after a 48-hour all nighter (if that's still considered an all-nighter at that point). The taste is pleasant and not bitter\/sour like some other cold brews I've tried. As with their lattes, I regularly get the Waimea (Choco\/Haupia flavored). It has a lot of flavor to it, but is not too sweet. Their food options are very good, as well! Their coconut haupia bars and butter mocha offer delicious sweet options and if I want something more savory, I go for the bacon\/cheese scone or masubi. I haven't tried anything here that I disliked.

From the coffee to the people, Hi Coffee truly stands out from the rest of the coffee shops in the Valley. I've never been to the Hawaiian islands, but if it is just as welcoming and delicious as Hi Coffee is, I absolutely cannot wait until I finally get to visit.La migliore Pizza in Las Vegas.
The best  Italian pizza in Las Vegas
WwwwwooooooooowwwwwwwwwwThe pizza would be a 3 star in my pizza rankings, but the friendly staff, great prices, and homey atmosphere earn this place a star bump. I was pretty disappointed in my lunch special pizza. I've been to NYC quite a bit, eaten a LOT of NY pizza and folks this aint it ! I did love the family vibe, and they treated me so well - I just wish the pizza was better. It was like warmed over mall food court type stuff. It *does* remind me of the food court pizzas I've eaten while in the city (Villa pizza in NYC comes to mind), but nothing special. I need to make it over there again beacuse clearly I caught them on a bad day, but unfortunately it's been a month and I still can't bring myself to go back !Had an amazing steak filet special, cooked to perfection. Had two vodka tonics while waiting which were somewhat strong. We had a large group and it was really disappointing to find out that some of our group could not sit at the same table we were at because the tables are bolted to the floor and cannot be placed together. It's pricey so bring your wallet. I spent just under $80 for myself with the meal and two drinks. The ambiance is fun and lively, but the acoustics do make it difficult to hear other people speaking. The bar was packed and had lots of happy hour specials, it looked like the place to network. It's dimly lit making it great for a date night.Great place to get pizza in the Venetian.  It's located just around the corner from the main lobby.  Pizza slices are New York style - thin crust, but huge slice.  Single topping is about $5 per slice.

At first, it seems like a let down because you think you are going to get a slice of pizza that has been sitting under the heat lamp all day.  But once you order, they pull a piece out and heat it up in the pizza oven for a few minutes.

Good service and good quality, I would eat there again.The Pita Shack is one of my favorite restaurants in Tempe.  They are right next to Whole Foods at the NW corner of Baseline and Rural.  Everything that I have tried (chicken and beef kabobs, chicken schwerma, gyros) has been excellent, and their soup is awesome (not sure what they call it, but they have it every day), it is thick like a pea soup, with basmati rice and great flavor.  The only thing that could be improved IMO is the tzatziki sauce, which is pretty thin.  The side salad is worth getting, everything is fresh with just the right amount of feta cheese, olives and veggies - I would probably go there just for the salad.

Aside from the great food, the guys cooking in the back and working the counter are not only masters of their craft, but really make you feel welcome.  If you are looking for great Mediterranean food in Tempe, this is the place to check out first.We went here for dinner this past weekend and still can't believe how bad it was! 

First, the ambience was woeful. The front is very open to the shopping\/food court area of the hotel which made it too loud and less intimate for fine dining. The decor was just plain ugly, with random wall pieces, prints of onyx (which looks like either bread or intestines, depending on your perspective) and streamers?

The food was even worse. I had the mixed grill, which was scallops, shrimp and crab claws. The scallops were cooked well, but the shrimp were definitely not. They were severely overcooked. Nothing on the plate had any seasoning at all, nor sauce, butter or garnish..nothing..just a plate of a few dry shrimp, bland scallops and plain, boiled crab claws. The presentation was so bad that I couldn't believe the place bears Emeril's name. I would love to see him judge the plate I was served on Top Chef!!

Tied for worst thing about this place was the house wine. While they have an impressive wine list, there is relatively little by the glass. We each had a glass of the house white. Oh my.. It is soooo bad. Rarely do we find a wine we can't drink a glass of..this is on the list. Maybe this is the punishment for not buying a nice bottle...blech..

Save your money, plenty of good places to eat in Las Vegas. This isn't one of them.Great place to come for drinks and apps with friends!I love the Irish Nachos!Definitely a hidden gem in the city! Everything is made fresh with quality ingredients, and low prices.
I love their pastas, my personal favourite is probably the Carbonara. Sooooo creamy.
Their pizzas are fantastic too (thin and crunchy crust, but soft in the middle), and you get to watch the cook hand toss the dough to order so you know its fresh!
I also highly recommend the meatball appetizer! It comes with garlic bread (!!!) and it's SO delicious drenching it in the tomato sauce and eating together with the meatballs and Parmesan. The calamari is great too.
If you like spicy food, remember to ask for their chilli oil!
I would 10\/10 recommend Tri Resto over any other pizza joints in the area. I see them doing a lot of take out orders as well, so it's a great idea when you're watching a game with friends at home and you're sick of eating cardboard from Pizza Pizza. You get much more menu options to choose from as well.

P.S. the younger cook there is pretty cute too, ladies :PMy girlfriend and I was walking up yonge when we decided to try out a random restaurant for dinner. Thus we went here as a quick date and it was quite a crowded pack with older people. It was really packed but the waiters made a small table just for the two of us. 

When the older waiter decided to explain the menu (he has a very thick authentic italian accent or something) neither of us could understand him but he just kept talking about the special. The two of us were more interested in the menu.

My girlfriend got the creamy chicken and I got the baked chicken penne on basil tomato sauce. The meals came out at a reasonable time and it was warm and full of flavor. There was a good amount of quantity and the quality was top notch. I wouldn't be able to make the same at home. 

Finally desserts came along and the friendly waitress told us about the secret caramel crunch cake, which does not show on the menu. The two of us were excited to try it out! It was amazing, the top was fluffy and mixed with a light texture crunch from the mid and bottom section of the cake. I am not usually impressed with cakes but this one really impressed me as the two of us gobbled it up real fast. My girlfriend even said that she would come here just for the cakes. 

The decoration is dated but in her opinion, she thinks that it gives an even better cozy feeling to our lovely date. I would suggest trying this place and the price for the meal was very reasonable.Aroma has such beautiful menu items with delicious fresh ingredients. We were hungry and in the area and looking for breakfast food. 

So the match was perfect. We ordered our items, one breakfast on the go and one shakshuka. I was very excited by the shakshuka which is rather unique. Basically eggs in a bowl of thick red pepper and tomato soup. So warm and inviting especially on a cold day. 

The breakfast on the go surprised me as for some reason I expected a sandwich. But it was filled with veggies and some scrambled eggs. The only want in that dish was perhaps a bit more eggs. 

The shakshuka was delicious and pretty close to what I had imagined. However about 1\/3 of the way into polishing it off, I discovered a label\/sticker inside. It threw me. And all of a sudden I was not hungry anymore. 

The manager was very kind and asked me what I would like. I said I have no idea right now. So she waited and then came by a bit later. Eventually I asked for a breakfast sandwich to go and she made it and brought it to me. Hence the 3 stars.  

Was it not for the label I would have given 4 and were it. It for the manager it would have been a 2 star rating. 

I will come back eventually and have another shakshuka. But it may be a while.  And as far as aromas go, this one is very nice to be at.  So maybe I'll even try it again in this location.Bagels here are pretty good. Soft yet crunchy but 4 stars bc a small everything with vegetable creamcheese turned out to $4! A little over priced but the person that made my bagel was very generous with the creamcheese. I would def come back!I came to this place on a Sunday exploring West Phoenix beer options (beyond the bud light crowd) and was not disappointed. We had pretzels and sausages in the bar where the bar tender was knowledgable about their beers and very helpful. On that trip, we bought tickets to Octoberfest here and brought our families in October. We had a blast!

The food is uniformly good and the beer comes in liters. It is like drinking from a fish bowl. Who wouldn't like that?!HUGE menu! The broth is fantastic. Pho makes everything better. The egg rolls and spring rolls are also amazing. Try the duck pho if you wanna get crazy.Oh god I love this place! 

The decor is beautiful and it's a perfect place for a date or girls night out! I went with a few friends and we had a great time. Service was fast and fantastic (on a packed Saturday night)! I ordered the Thai Basil and it was perfection!

Looking forward to checking this place out again :)What did you do to the bar area? You took away the authenticity and intimacy of this once great place. You blew it!The menu looks great...however they cant execute it. Party of four, had their chicken salad (was ok but what should you expect from that), chicken and waffles (the small portion of chicken was dry and not seasoned). The worst part was the "carne asada tacos" ...wheres the beef ~ see the photos. Slow service and understaffed...ugh...nice try.Service was outstanding and the food was on point; the food was on the safe side for the price though. The overwhelming hospitality is what made the experience for me tonight. Can't wait to go back!I've been going here for a while now, and really love this place. For a pub in Brampton\/Caledon border area, it's pretty decent.

I've always stuck with the burgers here, the guy\/girl cooking 'em clearly has a taste for detail. Buns are fresh baked daily from Ace Bakery, a very well renowned bakery in the GTA area. Meat is cooked perfectly and obviously freshly formed and cooked. My burger was cooked medium well and has a pinkish hue which is completely normal when using fresh meat.

I got the Avocado Salsa Burger with a Caesar salad and loved it. We paired it with a plate of nachos, which were awful.

The Burgers and sandwiches here are great, but the tacos and nachos just werent it. Overpriced and very small portions for the latin food fare. Stick with the beer and burgers here.

All in all, its a great spot to catch the jays or leafs games. TVs are everywhere here and it has a nightclub with pool tables on the other side of the bar.

##UPDATE##

The bar's been renamed to TJ's Local Bar and Grill, to make it more steak-houseish, but sounds like its being renamed back.OMGoooodness!! I would give 10 stars if I could!!
Food was FANTASTIC! We enjoyed lobster Mac, calamari, lobster bisque AND WOW the Sea Bass was the best I've had in AZ!! The "King Pasta" was also incredible!!
Service by "Ari" was second to none! She was such a pleasure!!!  Love Love this place!! 
We will definitely be back!!Wow, what a let down.  Checked out reviews before heading here and was surprised that this place was getting high reviews. The staff are very friendly but the place looked "old".  There are approx. 8 buffet dishes and about 2 dessert items.  Food selection was stale.  Your basic wonton, sweet and sour pork, dried pork (basically pork without the sweet and sour sauce).  They did not even have chicken wings.  Taste was bland and tasted like reheated food.  I think it's time to revamp the menu.not much to say other than this place is absolute fire! get there now. healthy options that are also healthy for your wallet ;) the service was quick and easy, and the employees treated me with great energy and attitudes. Love love love this place! thank you for this great experience!YummmmmBy far the best Mexican food I have ever eaten. The guacamole was the best me and my fiancé have ever had. The free range chicken was out of this world I highly recommend that dish. Ate it down to the bone. Shout out to the chef of The Mission. He needs a raise for sure. Being from New York my fiancé and me we like to think we're hard critics of food since New York is so competitive with food. This blows every Mexican restaurant in New York out of the water.Dinner at Joy Bistro was a frustrating affair. Our reservation was confused. We were first offered a seat at the least desirable table in the restaurant, right in front of the door (and I would suggest this table be eliminated, as if I were seated there it would be a certainty I would never return). Refusing it, we were seated at the elevated tables (bar style) on the wall opposite the bar. The restaurant is fairly small, so these tables increase the seating space, but I personally do not enjoy eating a bar-style seats.

Once we were seated we were promptly ignored for the better part of 20 minutes. Someone finally came to take our dinner orders, but I think he was the bartender. He could not answer any questions about the menu items. We hadn't even been asked if we wanted to order drinks. We had brought a bottle of wine to be uncorked at the restaurant. It took another 10 or 15 minutes for that task to be accomplished. Then our service disappeared again. Finally we asked the waiter from the next table to call over our server. She said she would just take our orders and became our defacto waiter for the remainder of the evening. She was pleasant and minimally attentive after that.

I had the Rainbow Beet Salad with arugula and buffalo mozza. I enjoyed it. tangy pickled beets, light, creamy dill dressing (not overpowering), and the mozza was pretty good. One of my dinner companions did not like it. Too much vinegar in the beets was her complaint. Main was Lamb Shank with what was described as an apple-fennel chutney, but it was just sauted fennel and some raisins, from what I could tell. Accompanied by mashes sweet potato and rappini. The meat had a natural strong lamb flavour. It did not turn out to be to my taste, but no fault of the chef. The fennel whatever was fairly flavourless. The sauce was uninspired. The sweet potato mash and rappini were fine.

Companions had the flank steak. I tried a piece. It was covered in a pesto that added much needed flavour. The steak needed some seasoning. The chicken carbonara was, supposedly, very good.

Overall, meh. The service was less than desirable. The food was plain. Not bad, but not great. I will not return to Joy Bistro unless I must. There are just too many restaurants in this city to waster my time there again.BEST SASHIMI IN TOWN!!! 

Came here for my birthday and we ordered a platter of sashimi (Salmon, scallop, white tuna, Hatmachi and Uni). Every piece of sashimi just melted in my mouth... it was oh, so fresh! The price was reasonable; each piece was about $1-$2 except for the Uni of course, haha. Besides from the sashimi, I've also had their Black Dragon roll, Rock n' Roll and the Spider Roll. The Black Dragon Roll and Rock n' Roll was on point!!! However, I was a bit disappointed with the Spider Roll, pretty bland and nothing really special in taste...
If you like Salmon a lot, order their Salmon Head. You should place the order a head of time, like before even looking at the menu! Because, it does take some time for it to be made! I'm never really a fan of Salmon Head, however, they grilled it to perfection here. Every piece of the Salmon was tender and juicy; except that they can possibly be easier on the salt! 

Service was quick and attentive. However, if you're a tea drinker like me, you'd have to constantly as them to refill your cup. The server do not attend to you unless you need something. Prices are fair for the most part; a bit expensive and it does amount up, but! The food's quality is just PHENOMENAL. Well, you pay for what you get right?!I love this place and everyone who works there. We were no less than 20 minutes late for our reservation, and they were hilarious about it. Not at all pretentious or exclusive. We immediately felt at ease instead of any place in Scottsdale that would make you feel like you needed to fall on your knees and beg their forgiveness for have the audacity of living a busy life. The food was great, we're going back this week with the in-laws. Easy environment, comfortable place, affordable only because they lack a liquor license and it forces you to drink water.Margaritas were thick and from an overly sweet, awful tasting mix. Chimichanga was stuffed with grease. Don't think I'll be back, but the staff was friendly at least.Food has been amazing everytime. Ignore the salthy review, food is bursting with flavours. Staff and owners really friendly. Not expensive, and always get your money worthThis was our first stop after checking into our hotel.  We were expecting drinks and fancy French food but what we got was so much more!  

Our waiter, Mauricio, was really awesome.  He chatted with us about his world travels, his previous careers, his future fiance and his favorite foods\/drinks.  He paired each course with a drink or glass of wine and was spot on with his pairings.  I had the avocado with fresh crab appetizer and it was paired with a riesling.  Excellent.  Then, the walnut and artichoke crepes with a fresh berry house cocktail.  Delicious!  Finally, a Pomegranate Italian-style margarita with some chocolates made on-site.  Fantastic!!!

We could not have asked for a better welcome on our first day in Vegas.  Yes, we ended up spending a small fortune for a total of 8 drinks, 2 appetizers and 2 entrees, but I couldn't be happier as I left and promptly took a nap.

Will definitely be back, probably our first stop for the next trip!

P.S. The Blue Cheese Souffle is out of this world!!!Visiting from out of town, and our concierge at the hotel directed us here for breakfast. I was skeptical, as it bills itself out as an Italian bistro. We went to Black Bear Diner first, but the wait was horrendous. Wound up at the Bootlegger. Had the wife and four kids with us. 

Breakfast menu is super simple, but just right. Captain Crunch French toast was great for the kids. The wife had a fantastic omelette, and the pancakes were great. Most of all, the service was fantastic. Claudia was our server and she was great and super attentive. Made us feel like we were at her house for brunch. 

All in all, it was super low key (which is a nice change in Vegas), delicious, and great service. 10\/10 - would recommend.My friends and I love "brunching" it up on Sundays. We've been to a lot of places downtown in particular, and we agreed that Glutton was a place we'd definitely attend again. I had the breakfast sandwich (probably one of the best sandwiches I've had) and the atmosphere is pretty cool. They are definitely busy (but who isn't on a Sunday)? We still got seated pretty quickly and the cocktails were decent. The waitress was a bit overwhelmed (she forgot a couple of things), but our experience was still good overall. The location is in great walking distance to Fremont, Container Park, and other nearby locations if you want to get another drink or have a bite to eat later afterwards. The parking nearby is also pretty easy to find on the weekends and mostly free.Finally stopped by this place and WHOA NELLY THIS TEA IS THE BOMB! I got a coconut chai latte made with almond milk. It's better than any other tea I've ever had and is sweet and satisfying like ice cream (but without the sugar or the dairy!). It's my favourite part about today so far, and I've had a pretty good day. I'm very glad this innovative tea place moved into the neighbourhood and I definitely see myself making "plentea" of stops here in the future.#1 Pabellon is awesome. The plantains make it. The sweetness goes great with the shredded beef and cilantro sauce. Waited 15 minutes for my order (not crowded either) but well worth it. Made fresh. Will go back again.Absolutely loved this place!!!! Must try the crispy rice and spicy tuna!!! Def would recommend!!Bread was dry. Poor costumer service. 15 minute wait for food. They are very unorganized. Bland food. You will be disappointed.This is our "Cheers" or "Winchester".
They have REALLY been upping the game lately, with special offerings! It's American craft beer week and they are releasing a different beer for each day! 
Food trucks often appear (I'm pretty sure most of the week now), and they partner with local talent to make beer infused popcorn, chocolates, and I've attended a dinner night at Whole foods featuring Tenaya Creek beer.
They also have art night in the back, I believe once a month.
It's not typical of me to make friends out in public, when when you see the same crowds, it's hard not to! So I have a whole group of friends now centered around good beer!
SO if you haven't been in a while here's what else to expect:
Food trucks visit because the kitchen has been closed since 2008.
They allow you to rent out the pool room space for events.
Live bands play here.
Jukebox lets you pay on your phone and remote transmit your request.
Specials around "holidays", and I say that in quotes because beer holidays are not observed anywhere but at bars.
The website is doing much better, with updates of "what's on tap?"...something I've always appreciated, a place letting customers know the latest brews.
I dont have anything bad to say :DDont waste your time and money. 
From the reconstructed chees3 sauce which had the consistency of cheesy sand. To the weiners in a Blanket for my guest in the uncooked filo dough it was horrendously nasty. A shame. Good concept, poor execution. I have spent many years in the kitchen to know that this can be fixed. Its all up to the owners to make the decision. 
Enough said. You will not see any of our money again.First time here and I have to say this is one of the best airport burgers I've ever had. Fries were hot and crispy and the burger was very juicy. They'll customize the burger so don't be afraid to ask. 

This is a much better option than the McDonalds past security if you are craving a burger before you take off.I'm a coffee snob and not apologetic for it.  If I buy beans for a great cup, I will have them shipped in.  That being said I can honestly say I have had the best macchiato ever at Berdena's.  In addition, the people who work here are knowledgable and super nice!  The pastries are wonderful and the waffles are light and beautiful compared to the thick heavy typical kind.  We had their lavender cappuccino special today and I can say that they were able to pair flavors that really work with an already great espresso bean.People were friendly, fast service. The amount of food is large! Lol I tried the sage chicken and waffles and it was delicious.This is a cool pub. The vibe is relaxed and the server was very friendly. 

They have these awesome red booths. On Sunday the place was not too busy. We came here strictly for drinks. They had a good deal for $5 Caesars or $4 mixed drinks. 

I ordered the whiskey sour. I can't say it was the most amazing cocktail I've had, but for $4 it was worth it. 

It's a cool place to grab a drink and hangout with friends.This adorable bakery is tucked in the back of a strip mall on the SW corner of Fort Apache and Tropicana and I count myself most fortunate to have stumbled upon it by accident.  Look for Teddy's - It's worth it!

My favorite sweet from the case is The Rock, which is a brownie-like cake but the REAL REASON I go to Teddy's Bakery is for the paninis!  They are absolutely outstanding!  The egg and feta cheese open-faced panini is heaven on earth.  It is also quite large and costs only $4, which is ridiculous for something so delicious.  The ham and egg panini sandwich is also excellent.  My husband and I usually get one of each and we each have half of both kinds.  

  In addition to the paninis, I have to recommend the meatballs which are served with a fresh greek salad.  Teddy's offers incredibly fresh food with authentic Bulgarian flavors and spices.  The atmosphere is comfy and clean and the place has a lovely decor.  I have seen a placard that says they offer a wi-fi connection but I haven't tried it yet.  This seems like the ideal place for someone who works on the road and has to eat on the fly.  Idea: Set up a mini-office while grabbing a great, healthy lunch.  The coffee is great, too.

I have eaten at Teddy's (10+ times) and have also ordered take-out orders (10+ times).  The food is consistently outstanding.  For the take-out orders, the paninis transport very well and even keep for a few days in the fridge.  I pop them in the toaster oven and it is like they were just made fresh.  They make an incredible midnight snack!

I highly recommend Teddy's Bakery for brunch or lunch.  As a matter of fact, I am going there right now because writing this review has given me a serious panini craving.I went there today with some coworkers for lunch for the all you can eat fish special that they have on Friday's and it was very much worth it. Upon entering the bar\/restaurant the first thing I noticed was how dark it was. The next was how big it was. There are two sides to this place and we opted to go to the side that had more lighting. I mean I don't know about you, but I want to actually be able to see what I am a eating. 

So after being seated and having our drink order taken, it took a minute for someone to actually come and take our order. It was kinda weird as it didn't seem to be that busy but who knows. In the end everyone ordered the fish and we all had it differently. Some had it fried, some had it baked, some had it blackened\/cajun and we all either fries or onions rings. Let me just say that it was worth the wait. The fish was so moist and fried perfectly. I had a piece of the cajun as well and it was seasoned just right. Oh and the onion rings? Good lawd they were good. I am not sure what they did back there in the kitchen, but they most definitely made up for our wait. 

The bill came and we were pleasantly surprised. The all you can eat fish special pretty much included the drinks for only .25 cents. Cool huh? So $13 or so dollars per person, plus tip and a VERY full stomach later, we all hobbled out of there and went back to work fat and full. As a matter of fact its 10pm and I am still full from lunch today. Sad but true and I only had one plate of fish!!! The all you can eat fish fry is worth it if you like fish. Be patient because its worth the wait.Split  a couple of dishes and dessert with my friend. First and foremost my favorite item was the pineapple fried rice (came with Chicken, Raisins, Nuts, Pineapple) which was made spicy, the combination of the spices and the pineapple makes me want to come here again. Also got a noodle dish called the pad key mew w\/ tofu that was pretty good and spicy enough for my tasting, but my friend recommended to get it Thai Spicy if your into that. Finished up with sticky rice w\/ mango and a Thai Iced Tea... Get there while you can.  Oh yeah and their music was killing it, Tracy Chapman, Shawn Colvin, Men at Work, some 90's shit.As soon as you walk into Les Moulins La Fayette and that wonderful smell of their freshly made baked goods hits you, you know that you've found a great place to start your morning.

This lovely patisserie and boulangerie located in Vieux-Montréal, on St.-Jacques, across from L'Hotel Montréal. For those of you staying at the Westin (as I was), take the elevator to the third floor, then follow the dots on the floor towards the St.-Jacques entrance to the hotel. (Believe me, based on my own experience, do yourself a favor and skip the hotel restaurant, as it can't come anywhere near the goodness and quality of Les Moulins La Fayette.)

You'll have a nice array of breads and pastries to choose from, and during my four-night stay in Montréal, I visited LMLF four times - yes, it's that good. Their chocolatine (chocolate croissant) is amazing, light and flaky, still warm from the oven with the chocoate still slightly gooey, easily the best chocolate croissant I've ever had. Their croissant aux amandes (almond croissant) is almond goodness through-and-through, and it's so popular that one of their regulars waves at the staff through the windows each morning to make sure they save one for him before they all disappear!

You can also opt for a more savory breakfast, which I did on my second visit, having a grilled ham, egg, and cheese breakfast sandwich that was just right, made to order and, along with their dark roast coffee, made for a great breakfast. They also make an excellent latte, strong and smooth at the same time - my compliments to the barista!

Their menu also includes sandwiches on their freshly baked bread, beautiful pastries, and a collection of chocolates, making me wish I had more time in Montréal to try out more of their creations. The café itself is quite comfortable, modern in styling, the perfect place to start your day with a fresh pastry, a really good cup of coffee, and the morning paper - exactly what you should do when you're staying in Vieux-Montréal.

Most importantly, the folks who work here are absolutely wonderful. The delightful woman behind the counter and her son (the masterful barista) greeted me warmly each morning, taking care of me as if I was a guest in their home. I'm looking forward to visiting with them again during my next trip to "la belle ville de Montréal"!Love El Fresco's...I go there at least 2 to 3 times a week...the Cochinita super taco is the bomb...love the carne asada tostada...with the Peruvian beans...OMG...but the best are the shrimp tacos...best shrimp tacos I've ever had...and they are the king sized shrimp! Great little place...somewhat strange location, but hey, it's the food that counts...the chips and green salsa are the bomb...Quick service - prob took less than 1 minute to get my cheese fries, hot chocolate shake, and 2 shack burgers. The orders were right and fresh as well. Tremendous improvement from my previous experience!They forgot my coleslaw, the jerk chicken wasnt even jerk chicken, it was some oily and spicy disgusting chicken swimming in some nasty curry sauce.The rice and peas were dry and had no seasoning at all. The worst part of the meal was the dumpling because it had nothing in it! It was just a dry ball of dough. The patty was not bad bad also nothing special and not worth the money, go somewhere else and save your money!!!!!I would give this place a 5 star if the service was better, food took a while to get to me but it was worth the wait. I got the Szechuan soup with korean style noodles with sliced beef and pork blood. It was amazing for around $10 for lunch! Just the right amount of spiciness and the beef was soft and easy to eat. Would definitely recommend!Very tasty and juicy chicken and mushroom xiao long bao. Sesame soy noodles were also good.I was really pumped to go here for the first time, but I was a little disappointed. They do have a sizable outdoor seating area, which is what brought me to check it out on a beautiful sunny day for happy hour. I'd give it another try because of the outdoor space, but I'm not dying to go back.

I've heard lots of claims of this place having an amazing beer selection and they may have at one point, but not when I was there. Multiple kegs were kicked and covered up and a few of the others were winter beers which was not what I was looking for on a spring day, so I ended up opting for something else. I thought the prices were OK, pretty average I'd say. 

They had tacos as the food special that day, but were told they could only do chicken because they weren't serving beef for another hour. That's fine. The tacos were OK, served double-wrapped with 2 tortillas which made the whole thing kinda dry. They would have been fine with just one tortilla, we ordered 6 tacos and ended up taking the second tortilla off of each one. We also had an order of "Tot-chos" which were tater tots topped with sour cream, salsa and cheese. You can't really go wrong with tater tots!

It was pretty empty when we went inside to eat and the music was cranked up SO loud, I could barely hear my friends across the table. It was like they had the 10pm volume going at 6pm. They have two pinball machines, but they are both set to $1 per game, which I personally think is ridiculous unless you have the newest game on the market. Most places have .50, .75 at the most. $1 per game is just too much.Ayce sushi in henderson! The best sushi bar and servers. Always on point with whatever you want to order. Fast and convenient location.Very enthusiastic staff, great service. Nice and clean setting that looks like the 70-80's with background music from the 18's. Generous portion, great flavors, fair price. I had the Breakfast Poutine with sausage, sunnyside egg, and home fries. SUPER GOOD! Ot also comes with toast. Generous amount of gravy and sausages. We also ordered a burger. Nicely marinated and seasoned, tender and juicy burger. Great place for brunch!This is the best BBQ in Phoenix hands down! Get there before 2pm or you will not eat brisket. FYI, don't go on a rainy day thinking you'll miss the lines. EVERY ONE ELSE is thinking the exact same thing. Trust me I learned the hard way.This restaurant is one of my family's favorite places to eat. At this point, we only go here 3 times a year or so due to it being fairly expensive. The fact that they a the chef's table and the kids club that basically gives an adult a free meal with a paid adult makes it worth it. We came here this time for my daughters birthday as it is her favorite place due to the food and he entertainment.

This place pretty much offers a 5 course meal with most of their dinner entrees. You start out with soup and a small salad. The soup is pretty good and always piping hot. The salad is ok but the ginger dressing is pretty tasty. Then comes, perhaps, the best part of the meal with the chicken fried rice. It is delicious!

My wife and I both got the Benihana Trio which gives you steak, chicken and jumbo shrimp. Add into this the fact that you get appetizer shrimp with your entree and it ends up being a lot of food. It all tastes great too! My daughters each got the Habachi Chicken. They also both love the chicken fried rice 

We always take leftovers home from here so it makes the price more bearable. But the entertainment of watching the food cook in front of you on the teppanyaki grill makes this place worth it. We will continue to come back here as long as they are around and love every second of it.This used to be my favourite place to grab really good takeout burgers from for the last two years. I'm not sure whether management changed or what but there's been a severe decline in service and quality accompanied by an increase in price. Mac and cheese is smaller but more expensive and dry, portions of fries have been halved and increased in price, wrong burgers have been received (wrong sizes more importantly), can't reach them by phone half the time, and the selection has taken a hard downsize. After my most recent experiences, I will certainly be finding a new regular spot.Went here again recently.  I will give an updated star rating for the fantastic happy hour prices.  4.25 for a pint from some exceptional beers.  They also have these 4.25 samplers, which at 4.25 you can get 3x and they will fill you up.  I thought this was a pretty good deal.If your into raw chewy ahi that every bit requires 15 mins to get through the Ahi tendon. (I ordered two plata of the Ahi and hummus.) then you came to right spot. Some of the worth quality Ahi I have had apart from a two day old supermarket sushi roll. Service was great.  The waiter did give me two $5.00 off coupons that I can only use on two separate occasions which means I need to give them my money two more times to save $10.00. I think the $50 I just spend for two plates of low low grade ahi was enough. Thanks but no thanks.The two stars awarded reflects an average score based on our dinner today. This eatery is housed in the "old" Tony Sacco's using the same gas\/coal fired baking technology. Not much difference between the two establishments.

The space is bright and welcoming, as numerous associates welcomed us to Kenna Coal Fired Kitchen. Our Wednesday visit was greeted with an unexpected promotion offering $10 selected large pizza's. It would appear there are special's available most days and would suggest you check what's on sale each day.

Wait staff is attentive, friendly and helpful explaining a varied menu and the days promotion. We shared a rather generous 1\/2 Greek salad consisting of fresh (large pieces) of greens, tomato's, olives and Italian dressing. Feta was served on the side as requested. The half salad is adequate for two.

The pizza was "unremarkable" or as my Bride said "a waste of calories". The very thin crust pie was painted with tasteless red liquid, fresh mozzarella and plenty of inexpensive pizza meat aka pepperoni. Considering the neighborhoods pizza competition, KCFK has some opportunity for improvement despite the high star totals by my fellow reviewers.Would never go back again, was waiting for over 15 minutes then our cashier sneezed into his hands and went back to start preparing food without washing his hands or putting gloves on. When I asked him to please wash his hands he kind of sneered at me and went to another employee and was making comments about it. Clearly lack of management and sanitation is an issue. It'll only be a matter of time before the health department shuts them down.Went here last night for the first time. The service was very friendly and welcoming.  Got seated at the bar despite them being bust and us not having a reservation.  The Oysters were the best I have had in the city. Looking forward to going back.We enjoyed the breakfast buffet during our stay at the resort. Although the selections offered aren't vast, there's enough to offer a decent variety. Their omelets are made to order and there are mini-waffles at the same station that are delicious! My only complaint is that there were no strawberries and whipped cream to accompany them. I also enjoyed offerings of smoked salmon, country bacon and home fried potatoes which were slightly crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. Of course there were other items, but I didn't eat them so I can't recall all there were. Our bill was $70 for two people which I think was very overpriced considering the foods offered, but it may have been because it was Fathers Day, I'm not sure.We were in from out of town with two small children and thought we would try Jerome Bettis'. We waited a half an hour just for drinks and then over an hour for our food. Anyone with two small children knows how awful that was. Also there was a table that sat down after us, got served, ate their food, paid and left before we even got our food. I found a manager who went and checked on our order and 5 minutes later came back with our plates. He never asked us if there was anything else he could do nor did he apologize that our food took so long. Needless to say we will not be returning to this restaurant on our next visit. Word to the wise, if you have children either go somewhere else or bring lots of toys to keep them occupied while you wait an hour for your food.Nice staff, nice environment, and great sushi! I've been multiple times for the sushi lunch special and it's always been amazing! I love taking my friends who don't typically eat in charlotte to eat here! It's always a hit!Some would say this place is overrated but c'mon! It's certainly worth a try. I've had their breakfasts and burgers didn't regret it. Be prepared to wait as it's always packed!Best sushi in town! The prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is great. It's a little small, but we were still seated quickly each of the times we've eaten there. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it took almost 10 minutes for our waitress to come over to our table the last time we were there (although she did a good job after that), and the cups were dirty (but she promptly changed them).Buyer Beware!!!  There's a reason this place offers a Groupon so often, and everyone seemed to be using one.  Went to the Scottsdale location for lunch, ordered 2 beers (Negro Modelo) 2 "house" margaritas, an appetizer (nachos) and an entree from the lunch section (burrito).  Total bill... over $50!!!  Reason: The "house" margaritas are charged on your bill as "Maria's Choice" and cost $9.50.  Meaning, 2 standard drinks accounted for 40% of the bill..  There is no price on the menu, because, as the waitress indicated, "The price changes, depending on the tequila used."  When asked about the "House" margaritas listed on the happy hour menu for $4.  "Oh, those are different."  So apparently, they only offer "House" margaritas during happy hour, but don't mention that when you order them any other time.    Worst part, the $9.50 margaritas are served with more ice than marg.  Meaning, after you finish drinking one, there's still a full glass of ice.  Good part (for them) it doesn't take much to finish drinking one.  Big rip off.    Lesson learned:  Take your Groupon, ask the price before you order, or only go for happy hour.If you are preparing for a marathon, i suggest you don't visit this place for a while. Nobody eats heavy  in the middle of a marathon also but if this is in your route then just come back right after.

If you are not preparing for a marathon, i suggest you run 10 laps around the nearest park so you will be voraciously hungry for a hardcore breakfast adventure here.

Other than my two suggestions, this homey place is a local favorite which brings a lot of good vibes to your belly.Went to this spot after the ball dropped on NYE. There was a good DJ, drinks and food and no cover charge!! The food also wasn't marked up (spent less than $18 for 3 Mexican pizzas with sour cream and 2 beefy grillers) which was surprising. People walking by seemed really confused about what they were looking at because at first glance it looks like a club or a bar especially with the music blasting.Horrible service and mediocre food.   We only saw our server when we were first seated. We ordered some spinach artichoke dip and then never saw her again. We made eye contact a few times and she just walked away to go chat with other servers or look at another table. After 40 minutes waiting to place our order for dinner we just left some cash on the table to cover our appetizer and left to go somewhere else.Not great. I read the reviews on here before I went for here lunch today and one comment I have to highly agree with is that their butter chicken is a disgrace to indian food! It's very watery, there is no depth or flavor and to top it off, they put more sauce than they do rice... it was very sweet and tasted like the chicken was almost burnt sitting there for days. 

The store itself is dirty, the tables to eat on were not clean and were disgusting. The chairs were even covered in little bits of rice. 

Bad vibes.Wanted some Mexican food so we stoped at this place. Walked in and got seated right away. As we looked over the menu we were given chips and Salsa. Chips were very crunchy and tasted recently made. Salsa was good and had a nice kick to it. We ordered two drinks to start. I had the michelada and my wife had a Margareta. 

Pink taco combo - it comes with the pink taco special that's a tortilla stuffed with black beans, grilled chicken, pickled onions, avocado and salsa de árbol. Accompanied by a cheese enchilada and pork Ribs. The taco was just ok. When you try to eat it, it falls apart and I'm. It a fan of things falling apart. The enchilada was good and cheese and the ribs were nice and tasty.  

My wife had the street tacos. 3 tacos on home made corn tortillas. She had the crispy shrimp taco with red cabbage slaw chipotle cream and avocado.  The Baja that came with fish, cabbage slaw, chipotle crema and Pico de gallo. The last taco she had was the al pastor that's rotisserie pork and roasted pineapple salsa. Oh can't forget the side of beans. She really enjoyed the street tacos and her favorite was the crispy shrimp taco. 

If staying in the hard rock or around the area give this place a shot. You will like the decor, ambiance and the food.This 5 star does not speak for anything at Taquitos Jalisco, but the tacos. My personal preference is the carne asada tacos, but the chicken is not bad. The tacos are flavorful, the meat is cooked just right, and the cooked onions are absolutely delicious. We order a bunch and take them to go for work all the time. They hold up in their little shells very well, and everyone loves them just as much as I do.

The actual place is a little tight, but the service is fast, so no-one tends to stick around for very long. There's a drive through window, which is convenient. Piece of advice though...skip the drive through and order inside. They have a bright alien green cucumber-ish salsa at the salsa bar inside, and that salsa is where it's at. Whatever it is...I'm still not entirely sure. But they don't give it out at the drive through window (inside orders only).

I've heard the quesadillas are good, but I don't know anyone who has gotten anything else there haha.If you want some cold, not Mexican food, come here. Everything is cold, even the meat. The tortillas aren't heated, and aren't good, the chips are cold.... I would've rather had Taco Bell. This is Ohio Mexican food at its worst. I would never come here again, avoid at all costs. Seriously below sub par food, and extremely over priced.Went with a group of 11 people and as far as I know all of the food we ordered was spot on!

Of course, we tried the pepperoni muffins and they are pretty freakin good... I ate 3 or 4 . 

The reason I took off one star is because the Italian wedding soup I ordered was not hot... At all. I didn't send it back because it was edible and I was hungry. I also noticed the stopped refilling drinks after the check was paid... 

Worth going back for the muffins but nothing else I tried (soup, pizza, chicken parm) was worth going back for.I've been coming to Tofu Hut for years, and it's gotten better over the years, specifically the service. I don't think it's simply the fact that since I go there usually 2-3 times a month that I'm recognized as a regular customer, but I observe other tables getting good service as well.

Food is pretty good, whether you decide to do the All You Can Eat or from their regular menu. The AYCE is soo good and a great value - my favorite meat is the brisket. I also love the salad greens and soups (bean paste & an egg) that come along with the meal. The banchan are some of the best I've tasted in any Korean restaurant. 

Overall, good service, decent value, above-average option for lunch, dinner, or late night feasting. I'm a loyal customer and will continue to come here, as long as nothing changes.

Tip: When you're done with your meal and are waiting for the check, but can't seem to flag down a server, you can just go up to the front counter and pay your bill there.This is a casual type of place where you can grab a group of friends to come and enjoy the delicious food offerings. Or, it can be just a quick, comfortable place for couples. We took our time in waiting for others to arrive, eating, chatting. There was no pressure to rush and later upon leaving, management made sure we had enjoyed our experience.
We loved checking this new place out and now have the menu and ordering system down-pat! Walk in, head to the little red signs with numbers and stands on them, order the food, move on down to register 2 and order drinks and then pay for it all. Have a seat with your number on the table and I swear your food will come out piping hot in about 5 minutes. GREAT pizza oven, takes about 90 seconds to make the za in 600 degree heat. NOMS! 
Our table of 6 ordered 3 different salads, poutine, rosemary fries, pasta carbonara, meatballs, 2 pizzas... all very good. No soggy pizza here despite the very thin crust.
Staff was friendly.
Does it remind me of Famoso? Yes, but that is NOT a bad thing.
We found the food prices to be quite reasonable. (EX -= $11 for a nice sized 4 slice Margarita pizza, $5 for a side arugula salad with roasted veg.)
The cashier told me that they just got their liquor license today so soon, you will be able to have a glass of wine with your dinner!
We had an amazing time and will return when down south!This was my first time here.  I remember seeing them at the taco festival last year and thought we'd give them a try.  They're really helpful when picking out what meat you want.  The girl gave us samples of everything to try.  After the fist few I lost track of what's what.  No matter what you get, you can't go wrong!  
The only thing I would say is they need more signs to find them.  I drive down 7th street every day and I had no idea they were here.  I'll definitely be back again!They have really tasty cheese curds! Feel like it is the best in Madison!!! Definitely recommend to everyone!

Also their brat is good. Some of the flavor(probably because of different seasonings) are bit strange but overall it is really good~!Food was ok, but the servers there were slow and not attentive. It took forever to get a refill on coffee. I won't go back.Let me start by saying I have frequent ed this restaurant many times and food is very good. That said I was appalled at how we were treated tonight I have never been treated so rudely  from an establishment that takes my money and makes their living off of customer service. (And I'm originally from NY where I've experienced rude) Apparently this establishment is closed on Mondays. They were having a special event-however- no notification was posted. So we went in. Ordered drinks- expecting happy hour pricing. Served us\/charged us full price and after we paid actually yelled "get out". Could it have been handled better- absolutely. If we had politely been asked to leave or explained the situation- we would have left. If you are  considering this restaurant I would go to Casa Mia on 136th. You would think local restaurants would want to encourage local clientele. Not Maria this spot. Maybe bad day, but to outright yell is unacceptable.Did an all you can eat (AYCE) here a couple times.  The fish is fresh but not the best.  I had a bad taste from their Uni but that could have just been one day.   They're consistently good but I find myself using alcohol to get by during some of my meals.  

I went  during the night and it wasn't too busy but the sushi dishes came out so slow.  The staff is friendly but next time I think I'll try to sit closer to the fish because our sushi took a bit of time to come out.

One day I'll get my picture on that wall!My friends and I happened to be around the area and we were craving ramen. We yelped and found this place. It's a small restaurant but the seating was nice. It wasn't too crowded when we came in. 

My friend ordered the Chicken Karaage and it was delicious. The drizzled mayo on top looked overwhelming but it wasn't surprisingly. Though, I felt that the chicken was undercooked due to it's chewy texture instead of firm. The batter helped with a crunch and overall we enjoyed it.

We also got a Chasu bowl, I have never tried one before but I found it tasteful. 

Every time I try a Japanese restaurant I have to try their Agedashi Tofu. My favorite dashi sauce is at Ichiza in Chinatown but Fukumimi's Agedashi is coming up at number two. Two really good sized deep fried tofu pieces and their dashi sauce was not salty at all like some other places. FIVEEEEE STARS!! 

As for the ramen, I got the Kogashi and my friends all got the Tonkatsu (Miso). 

I was very pleased with the Kogashi. I don't even know how to describe it. It was perfectly salted and the broth was very good. The noodles were thin and that's how I like it although I didn't know there were bean sprouts, not fond, but I ate them anyways.

Overall, I really do like this place. I recommend trying it absolutely!Great atmosphere and food. Unique menu and staff very helpful to recommend dishes. Focus on local ingredientsSpice Island is definitely a hidden gem in Oakland. I had never heard of it before and a colleague suggested we all grab lunch there. Little fact this place does offer gluten free options.

I was surprised by its variety of Southeast Asian options on one menu. I personally tried the Burmese pork and coconut rice and added a side salad. The salad was phenomenal and I was taken back by the complexity of flavors within such a simple dish. But the pork was everything! It was absolutely one of the best dishes I've had in a long time. The meat was so tender and full of flavor. The spice of the pork alongside the sweetness of he rice was perfect.

I also sampled the three veggie curry that my colleague had and it was amazing. I do not not travel to Oakland much but when I am there this is a place high on my priority list to visit. This is definitely a must try if you already haven't.This review is meant to be highly useful to you as a potential customer of PaintLounge - the things I wish I knew upon my time at their "expressions" evening.  The expression evening is an event that you pre-purchase tickets for, and keep in mind they have a pretty strict cancellation fee.  The event is $28 including tax, and was touted as having live music, free style paint, and then you get two non-alcoholic drink tickets.  That was all the info we got.  They also tell you to get there at 7:15 pm because the event starts right at 7:30 pm.

Here is what I wish I knew:
- actually get there at 7:15 pm.  They have limited stools.  They really should ask you upon ticket purchase how many people are in your group, and then pre-select seats so you just stand at the easel they pick for you.  Instead, I would pick an easel, and the lady would come around and move me.  This was very frustrating, and a bit rude.  I didn't get there early so you could just keep moving me.  When she finally settled on where I "could" stay, another group asked us to move - all of this could have been avoided if they asked for more info upon ticket purchase.  They have a registration list, so it's not like they don't know who is coming.
- they have plastic bags you can put around your purse or personal belongings.  The coat rack fits very few coats, and no spaces for bags.  Don't want to get paint on anything
- they have pencils and erases so you can sketch what you want to paint before putting paint to canvas.
- they don't have decaf coffee options - pretty stupid for an event on a week night that starts at 7:30 pm and goes until 11 pm.  So if you don't like caffiene late at night, you are limited in your selections
- the music is really amateur. The whole event is amateur, but not in a bad way, just in a very "local" way.  The singer kept apologizing for things, and then they had the barista sing for a bit, and basically everyone who worked there took a turn singing.
- everyone is weird.  the people who are attracted to this type of event are very granola, and want to talk to you, and want to talk about art, and you may not want to.  I didn't want to.  Just don't, then.
- you actually will be there a long time, at least until 10 pm.

Here's the info they give you when you get there:
- here are the paints, here's where to put dirty brushes, there's a break at 9:15 pm to listen to original songs by the singer.  Two drinks per person.  That's it.  That's all they told you.  They do this at 7:17 pm, so if you aren't there then, it's a bit confusing.  

So, why 4 stars?  Because it was fun.  It was actually really fun.  I'm not an artist, I don't ever do "arts and crafts", but it was really enjoyable.  It could be a fun date night, it could be fun by yourself.  It was interesting and I felt like I got good value for my money.  I wish they had alcohol, but it wasn't needed.It was an expensive meal (as indicated in the dollar signs) but it was one of the most fantastic meals I have ever had. It was a great blend of modern food with an Asian theme. Me and my wife shared the calamari then the Diver Scallops and some Fried rice. It always seems like the portions were not going to be enough but when you are actually finished with the plate it was just enough to fill you up completely.

If I am back in the vegas area I will for sure go back.Been here for breakfast and dinner, and it was good both times. Had french toast\/omelette for breakfast and Cobb Salad\/Bruschetta\/Turkey Jive for dinner.  Location is nice because after your meal you can take a stroll in Frick Park, and\/or grab some ice cream next door.I am always up for trying out one of those places featured on food network. The wait to get into this place was long and goes out the door. Its a very small restaurant with about 15 tables at best. Its one of the divey places where the staff clearly knows what they're doing and does it right. when we finally did sit and order service was fast. I had a meat omelet with hashbrowns. Im not much of a breakfast person so I wasnt overly impressed with it. Large portions though. I would come back here to try more of the menu.Visiting for Christmas dinner and everything was FABULOUS. Dinner was affordable and delicious. Drinks were amazing. Such a nice experience. Alicia was one of the best waitresses I have ever had.My go to is the Adobo fried rice which comes out in a monster 6 egg omelette! Folded around the delicious fried rice and it comes with a side of pancakes, which I upgrade to the red velvet flavor which is the perfect little dessert at the end of eating that savory omelette. Another favorite of mine is the loco moco add you must upgrade to the garlic rice with this dish. Elevates the flavor to a whole new level!Fun place, with a real beer garden and great food.  Open late too.

Beware of the waitresses though, who seem more than happy to try to foist yet another liter upon you, inflating your tab further and further north...Protein style spicy deluxe isn't exactly low carb. It is dellish though. Talk about fast drive through service. They have their system down.My wife and I came to Nicky's on a whim.  She had lunch from this location in the past.

We arrived around 6:15PM.  We were greeted and sat quickly.  That's when the wait(s) began.  About 15 minutes after being seated, the waitress came and asked if we had been helped.  We weren't alone in the back of the restaurant. We were seated in the main aisle way.

We ordered our food, my wife, a noodle curry dish, ($13.50) and myself, the "Jalapeño," with shrimp ($15.50) The shrimp was an upcharge.  We also ordered a house salad to split, as my wife raves about it.($7.95)

Our salad came after an additional 10 minute wait.  We finished it and our waitress stopped and made small talk about the dressing.  It was delicious.  An iceberg lettuce with mango, pineapple, carrots, and crushed peanuts and a house made dressing that was like a looser duck sauce.

Our salad plates were taken, and again, the wait.  After 30 minutes another member of the wait staff said our food should be out shortly.  It came about 8 minutes later.

My wife's dish was well played in a decorative bowl, with a ladle and spoon.  The sauce \/ food ratio was excellent.  

Mine was served in a large soup bowl, with a very small portion of rice on the side. There was a lot more food \/ sauce than rice. The most disappointing observance at this point were the five (5) shrimp in the dish.  They were small shrimp that had not been tailed. 

The food was delicious.  I asked for a 3 out of 5 for spiciness, and the dish was dead on.  After scooping two spoons of rice, my serving bowl was empty.  

We had not seen a waiter or waitress for some time, our water glasses were empty.

I finally flagged down our waitress and asked for some additional rice.  She said it was an extra $2.95.  I declined.  Our water glasses remained empty.

We finished our meal and requested the check.  Another wait.

Finally we were cashed out and paid.

Sorry Nicky's.  The food was delicious, but the small portions, up-charges, and poor service will keep me from returning. 

Try the Silk Elephant or Noodlehead if you're looking for Thai in Pittsburgh.Hadn't ate here in years, was starving, decided to give it another try. Went through drive thru last Saturday. Ordered a chicken strip meal and the cashier repeated it back and then said oops you wanted the chicken tenders and here I am trying to give you the other chicken. Mistakes happen, I understand, I worked in fast food before. Had to mention chicken strips instead of the regular bone chicken about 3 times before the cashier repeated back chicken strips, so we thought we were rang up correctly. We got to the window and there were two ladies in the drive thru area. Paid $17 for 2 small meals and a side of mac and cheese. When I got home and opened my meal it was bone in chicken. The only thing that tasted decent was the mashed potatoes. No receipt showing what we ordered was provided, just the debit receipt for what was charged to my card. Never again. I should have stuck with Chick-fila.Don't judge a book by its cover! I am always on the quest for a great bacon cheese burger and Rocket fit the bill! It doesn't look like much from the outside. But when you come in you will be amazed. The soda selection is amazing. I could stay there all day trying different root beers! 
I tried the gyro, bacon cheeseburger, and fries. I was in fat man heaven. 
Burger was juicy and good bacon too, not the cheap bacon a lot of places  use. The gyro had thick lamb. I was very impressed. 
The service was spot on too. Very quick and answered my questions. When I mentioned I liked root beer they took me over to the giant selection of sodas and told me if I wanted more they had a whole store next door (Pops). I appreciated that he walked me over and didn't just point like a lot of places tend to do.
I will definitely be back to try more of the menu.slices of pizza with heaping amounts of shawarma chicken, garlic sauce and hot sauce?? for $2.50?? What's not to like??

Super fun place to bring people on dates. Appearances are lacking but more than made up for by the taste. Don't expect to be able to eat inside, the physical space is tiny as hell.Came here for the first time tonight. We ordered the carne asada taco meal, super nacho's, a kids meal chicken taco, a cheese quesadilla, and chips with salsa. Everything was great my daughter enjoyed her kids meal and the price was right for the amount of food she received. The taco meal was very filling and the green salsa was really good. I would for sure return here for taco Tuesday or a margarita. The girl behind the counter was very friendly polite. Love the decor and the seating was very open.closer to 2.5 stars, but i'll round up with a coupon. Without a coupon, round down.   Not too bad with a 2 for 1 offer.  

Had the spaghetti bolognese.. not bad!  Not quite as good as Macoroni grill, but it came close.  

The free bread was edible.  3 different types, although somewhat mediocre in quality, it wasn't that bad.  The butter was bland, and flavorless.

For dessert, I had the creme brulee.   Pretty average.. About buffet quality, but a bigger portion. 

Overall, not as bad as I expected, but nothing that blew me away either.Good Chinese Food that I had in Arizona......highly recommend ！Very good service，I love this place，will come back......2nd time coming here with a group, very rude waitress. 1st time they had the nerve to bend my ID to check if it was fake because apparently I looked too young. They broke it in half. They didn't offer to replace it or make it up to us or even apologize! Whoever the manager was at the time was very nasty and didn't handle the situation well.First thing I would like to mention is? Service was absolutely fantastic. They were really busy but when they served us, they were very friendly and very warm. We celebrated my boyfriend's birthday here and they did extra service for his birthday that I didn't ask for which was turn off the lights when the cake came, not charging a cake cutting fee etc. Their food was not bad either. i didn't enjoy my polenta so much but all my other friends enjoyed their meal. The hemp burger was apparently delicious and I tried my boyfriends three cheese lasagna which was VERY good. I really liked the fact that you could opt to make your dishes vegan on demand\/request. It caters to vegans out there for sure. I would definitely come back again if I'm in the neighborhood and try the quesadilla and nachos.My love for sushi lies in its freshness. I love my sushi raw and fresh so hand rolls, nigiri, and sashimi are my favorite types. For these reasons, Señor Sushi is not a place that I frequent. Most of the rolls on the menu appear to be breaded, fried, and drenched in sauces. 

If you are a fan of the fried rolls and prefer that to more traditional sushi, you will probably love this place. If you prefer traditional sushi, you will probably not care for it very much. Either way, it's worth a stop because this place is a Mexican-Japanese fusión and kind of unique in that aspect. 

I would not recommend going late on the weekends because it's PACKED and the music is so loud you can barely hold a conversation without almost yelling.Best coffee in CLE full stop. It's so good that even when I serve it at home from my distinctly not-fancy drip coffee maker, people routinely say, "Wow, this is *great* coffee!" Worth every penny.Well, it's been a few months and I'm afraid I have to update my review.  I came in the store the other day and many of the shelves were barren.  I took a photo of the meat department (which I will upload) and there were few meats available.  I asked a Manager if they were shutting down the store and trying to get rid of inventory and he told me they were in Chapter 11 reorganization and would have the shelves stocked by vendors the following day and were promised better support going forward.  

Now, I hope that is true and they make it because they have good products and it's convenient for a quick stop on my way home from work.  I think I may be willing to fight a small bear for their bakery's brownie cookies as well.  In addition, I also think their produce is nice compared to Von's.  

As far as pricing, you just have to look for deals. They have come down it appears and I still say Albertson's has higher pricing.  

Even though this location is not my main shopping spot (nor was Von's previously as something happened where they went downhill a year before Haggens came along), I am rooting for them to get their groove on and succeedGreat social place!  Even offers vegan options.  Waitress was knowledgeable and super friendly.Pre-concert drinks are a necessity so we accidentally wandered in here tonight, thinking it was another restaurant. Oops, but what a great mistake. We ordered the watermelon cocktail (god I don't remember the damn name), but it was interesting with its smokey tequila, fresh melon, and a hint of chili. We were just going to get dessert ( the pineapple panna cotta was divine), but the huge cart-o-guacamole rolled by, so of course we couldn't turn that down. There were so many interesting options to add to the mighty guac. I wanted to try the chicken skin, and my husband had to be really weird and add banana, much to my protest--but what the hell, you only live once! We added it all in addition to a lot of heat! It was so delicious and interesting, I wanted to throw the rest in my purse with a spoon for the concert, but you know, class... All in all, we really enjoyed this place and look forward to making it our downtown spot. On a side note, the chef was banging and f-bombing passionately in the kitchen. Next Gordon Ramsey? Maybe, but definitely a seat indoors next to the kitchen next time for dinner and a show. Whatever he's doing in there, it's working! Food was great. Thanks!Hey guys it's your one and only hoodlum eating goodlium. It'd your boy Nav, and that is why I'm not a rapper gentleman I can't rhyme. I leave all that rapping stuff to the professionals. Shout out to P. Reign for being my unofficial sponsor. Unofficial cause he don't know me yet. Anyways on to this restaurant review.

I'm gonna sum this up really quick and for people that wanna know what I think here it is;

Food - 3\/5
Service - 1.5\/5 - I am being very nice with the .5

For the rest of yall here's my in depth review. Fun fact about me when I was in school I never wrote reviews cause I was a badass and ain't no person gonna tell me what to do.

So it was a Sunday during brunch we walked in at around 1:30 so it was packed we stood inside for at least 15 min for somebody to acknowledge us, and that's after I waved them down. They're lucky this wasn't in the hood or else - guys, we all know what would've happen...I would've waited patiently at the door cause I'm scared of the law. 

So once we were waiting for a seat my friends asked the bartender for a drink the lady at the bar said "I'm the only one at the bar and I have to serve my tables before I do anything" pretty rude because a normal
Bartender would've just said sure just give me a sec. We're asking for a drink not to milk a cow. Anyway so we got our seats and then ordered our food. I had the eggs Benedict they were good but not much depth in flavours. I felt like it should've had a little more of a saltier taste. And also had their drip coffee which was recommended by the waiter as he told me it's really good. I had a sip of it and it was very light coffee, and I'm not going to criticize the coffee as maybe some people like it light. 

Overall it's a nice place to bring a date or somebody from cragislist as there's a hotel right beside the place. The developers of this area really thought it through. But all jokes aside if you bring your girl make sure it's an extra special occasion as the bill will rack up and you'll be discussing financing options with your waiter.Korean pork bone soup, bimbimbap, steamed and pan-fried dumplings, jajamenyeon, they cover all the bases here!  I also really enjoy the free side dish starter.  It keeps things interesting.  I like that they are able to accommodate larger groups since it's not as busy as Korean town.  

A big group of us came after badminton at night and the service for the group was great.  They are attentive and helped us understand the menu.  The noise level is average, and they have this weird Korean TV show on the entire time.  I'd definitely go back.  Can't go wrong with Korean pork bone soup!Went there on a night with a huge group of ladies so we had the entire back room which was perfect for our group. Scott was our bartender and he was great! This was my first time at 5th and Wine and I was very happy. I had heard great things about the food, drinks and service so I was happy that we were going there. I had referred friends there because I had heard so many good things so getting to go there I could finally see for myself. I ended up having the Mac & Cheese app which was a perfect size and two glasses of wine. The food and drinks were amazing and I cannot wait to go back.This neighboorhood bar is located in the North Collinwood area....Think Waterloo District.I really like Dos Coronas. The fresh salsa is so delicious. The service is pretty good! The servers never leave the costumers sitting for long periods of time without asking if we would like something. The men at the counter are very friendly. The dishes are very good and prices are affordable. The happy hour drinks are cheap and delicious as well. Lastly, when I order pick up they are done in 10 to 15 minutes. They are never late in preparing my order. Also, a positive point is that pick up food comes with free chips and salsa!Yes this place really has skilled bartenders and they're armed with all the right ingredients. The drink menu is carefully laid out by era and they hardly miss many drinks. If it's not on the menu the passionate bartenders know how to whip it up without looking in  a book. The food is very high end and they have it priced at half off until 8 pm. This is way good as you can get high quality food for about the price of outback. The service does lack a little as it takes time to get good food and drinks and it seems the place is ran with limited help either because the owner is trying to save on costs or it's hard to find the help they need to make these labor intensive cocktails. This is imo is for sure the best bar in all of Las Vegas and possibly all the west coast. The only fault I see is that the ice cubes were not clear and if they corrected that with freezing them the correct way or getting an ice baller this place would be the best in the west.Stumbled upon a new bakery in North York\/Scarborough. They have only been open for a week or so but from the taste of the pastries and churros they definitely know what they are doing.

It is a small cafe style bakery which offers european style pastries, Argentinean empandas, and delicious churros. 

It was a great find and hopefully they are here for a long timeWARNING: The cushions on their chairs\/booths are disgusting. Mystery spills and stains and and who knows WHAT ELSE(!!) all over their once white cushions. Ichiza.. please replace your cushions for the love of god.

NOW FOR THE FOOD!

GIZZARDS: super chewy, but nicely seasoned.
DEEP FRIED BABY SPANISH MACKEREL: I think they gave us about 20 of these things. We dipped them in their spicy mayo concoction. Not bad, not bad at all.
SPIDER ROLL, SPICY TUNA ROLL: Meh. Nothing spectacular. I found them pretty mediocre, even though fresh.
UNI & SQUID ROLL (WITH NATTO): First, the uni was good, so was the squid, but the natto was awful. The spider-webby feeling was difficult to swallow. The smell was rancid. And under the uni was this raw potato mush that was super gooey. Definitely not my favourite.
RED SNAPPER CARPACCIO: Not bad.. but it had that potato goo again. Bleh.
YELLOWTAIL TARTARE: If you've been reading about this here on Yelp, you need to know this is like a Mexican-inspired tartar. The tuna is mixed with avocado and placed atop a fried tortilla sandwiching sushi rice and some fresh pico de gallo. It is a strange combo but it works. Really well.
UNI SASHIMI: Delicious. Fresh. Tasty. BUTTER OF THE SEA! For $6.75 you get about six pieces of good uni. I was impressed.
HONEY TOAST: Man. We devoured this friggin thing. The bread was perfect - had that chew you need to sop up the honey\/butter\/melty iced cream, and the outside was toasted nicely. Mmm.. thinking about it makes me want it.

Pricing: fair
Service: good
Place gets packed.. even after 9pm on a Thursday night.

P.S. Have fun reading their menu!!Waited 2 hours for food guy calls me and tells me that lady called me and said up to 90 minutes! No one called me and he goes well do you want it!!! Annoyed and hungry but I don't what it! On page said 45\/60 minutes!When I saw this restaurant featured on diners, drive ins, and dives, it looked like the most amazing fish taco I could ever eat...it was good but just ok, I was def let downUnprofessional food made by the owner of the restaurant. They recently change their chef and food just taste like home made food. Not recommend this place and won't come again. Ordered 3 dished for two ppl and all of them taste bad in my opinion. It's worse than the Chinese express food sold in the food court.Tasty's is a no-nonsense Caribbean takeout spot on College that I can see has many fans of its homestyle cooking. Don't expect table service as this is a styrofoam takeout container type of fast food joint, but with a homey family run atmosphere. 
I ordered the bone-in chicken roti and it was fabulous! The wrap was gooey-oooey chewy delicious and the chicken inside was tasty too. Nice warm curry with some typical Carib hot sauce to spice it up just right. The portion was generous as you would expect for the price offering excellent value.
Great spot to know about in the area as an alternative to typical fast food or pub grub.Decent atmosphere, reasonable price and great meat! This will be a great place to escape from "expensive" buffet in strip. :pLove this place! Don't remember the names of all the dishes I tried here but the Salmon and Rosti and the banana chocolate cake were too good to be forgotten. I highly recommend those with any of their freshly squeezed juice! 

I also love how simple their menu is! It takes me half the time to choose from here compared to other restaurants. 

But I'll warn you, it's quite pricy and if ur addicted like I am then it's quite the rip off. But the pricing is understandable since it's a healthier place to eat. 

I think everyone should at least try eating from there once in a while instead of the food court. It goes without saying that I will definitely be doing just that when I'm not broke.Very Clean...food was great, tasted really fresh! Only wished I had gotten the fried rice instead of the noodles. Noodles were good but the rice was amazing. My daughter also got the Hot Cheetos Elote and she loved it!This was my first time to a Chick-fil-a.  
My nephew told me about this place so I had to try it.  I think this could be the best fast food chicken sandwich I've ever had !!
I ordered the spicy deluxe chicken sandwich.  It was cooked perfect.  It came fresh, hot and juicy.  
The waffle fries were also real good.   The exterior was crisp while the inside was soft and fluffy.  
I will defiantly go here again. 
I highly recommend this over other fast food places.i held my lunch meal here for thirty of my wedding guest on june 22nd 2012 the service was really good i give it 5 stars the ppl that got our sodas were quick and helpful to any of our question regarding where certain foods were. There was a large selection and the food was really good. It was a little pricey but it was my wedding day.Houston's we got a problem!!! What happened to this place.  In days past the menu was plentiful, the food was great and prices were reasonable.  This no longer exists.  I don't know how on earth this place can survive.  The food was terrible, some too cold, some just plain old bad! The wait staff to interested in turning a table, when in fact it wasn't even crowded, literally interupted a conversation taking place between two of my guests to ask if we wanted dessert. Have you no home training???

Frankly if I could give no stars I would do that.  Wake up a smell the competition or you will be out of business in the blink of an eye.So they closed it down and remolded. Bringing the buffet up to par with most of the other casino properties.  It has a modern vibe, with muted earthen tones, browns, grays and golds. 

They spread the buffet line from one end to the other without the middle salad bar. One cool feature I really enjoyed was the middle of the line a made to order crepe station with fresh fruit. My husband kicked it a notch and made himself a bowl of ice cream topped off with fresh bananas and banana foster sauce he then added to his crepe! 

The salad end if facing the line is on the left, everything was fresh and the staff kept it that way while we where there. I even saw them change out the rolls with fresh ones! The opposite end is the desserts and the strawberry sorbet was way too good! Cleaned the palate.

There where several soups, it was seafood night so there where two gumbos. Sushi was decent for a buffet. I wasn't a fan of the warm crab legs, they seemed to be a bit over cooked, but I loved the fish taco. The filet was crispy and love the combination slaw with it. There is cold crab legs, oysters, muscles and clams as well as the peel and eat shrimp and crawfish!

It's been improved for sure. Clean, servers keeping up with refills and the line monitored for freshness! Friday night, seafood night. You gotta try it.I went with my mother and we usually always have a great time. However, I had not been back since they remodeled and I can now see why. I think the place has great food hands down. I cannot comment on the beer because I only go for the food. My food was great but my mother's salad had a lot to be desired. 

My mom advised the waitress that her salad was not that good. The waitress said " I'm sorry" and walked away. She did not offer to bring my mom something else nor did she offer to have the salad remade. My mom did not put up a fuss because we were under time constraints. However, she did call and speak with a manager later that day. The manager did not offer to send a gift card. She advised my mom the next time we were at the Brew Kettle to ask for her and she would see what she could do for us. 


Okay? I need not say more.Service was super slow we waited 70 minutes from when we ordered to get our food. Food was cold the only good thing was the chips and salas waitress blamed it on having only one cook because the other two cooks left early. Will never go back there hopefully the one off 16th street is better. Oh and my Wife had to leave the bathroom door cracked open with a chair because the light was burnt outThere were mixed reviews on Yelp so we were hesitant to try it, but have now been 3 times.  We think it's very good food at a reasonable price.  Large portions too.The food is great. Service was slow. A little pricey but nice atmosphere.  Make sure you have reservations or you will be waiting.... It is definitely a place to go for the food! It's busy every night.I love southern comfort food and this place really hit the spot. Ingredients were fresh, menu was classic but elevated and there was a nice charming vibe to the whole place. 

We shared the fried okra and green tomatoes and burrata cheese as an appetizer. Then had the shrimp and grits with chorizo as our main dish. It came out with complimentary biscuits with a side of honey and jam. Pretty much devoured everything and didn't have room for dessert. 

Service wasn't fussy but really attentive. All around a great experience.Brooklyn bowl is awesome! The food and the service is top notch! Bowling and concert venue can't be beat! Our waiter-Micah-both nights we have been here is a rock star!!Fun place, dessert crepes w ice cream!.. I'm going back, especially when the warm weather hits.Loved this place!!! I ventured here, because it is quite a distance from my abode. I was not disappointed in the least and plan on making the trek regularly in the future. The combination of rolls and appetizers on their AYCE menu is vast. They have the cooked rolls with mayo and crab and crunch that my sister loves and they also have the poke and Cajun albacore that I adore. Service was impeccable and the lunch price at $21 is totally worth it. My nephew ate for $14 AYCE. This is definitely one of my fave AYCE places in town!Horrible service. Ordered take out and came to pick it up 25 min later. I sat in the restaurant for over half an hour waiting for them to get my order ready. Turns out it was on the hot plate the whole time. I could even see it!

Thanks for the cold food and horrible service. I wish I had better things to say. Considering they catered my wedding. Oh btw that service was also horrible but that's for another day.....I was very excited to hear about this festival at the Silverton, especially seeing all the food trucks. In the end, I felt the festival was a severe let down, especially after visiting the O-bon festival earlier that day on Spring Mountain.

We had arrived after dark, but well before the closing time on Saturday. There were only a few food trucks and several generic asian food booths. Many of the vendors seemed very unenthusiastic and selling generic asian tchotchkies. There was an octagon fighting ring set up, but the fights occured earlier in the day I suppose. This festival definitely was not worth the $12 admission fee, if anything waiting in line and paying such a high admission to enter made me expect a lot more than what was offered.

Sadly, I don't forsee visiting the 3rd Annual Asian Food Festival.So having tried this before I went back for lunch. Beat the rush but it still took 30 mins to get the order. Nice service but over priced for what showed up from the kitchen. Salsas were fair but nothing special. Sadly the relleno was flavorless and the black beans also. Other order was a SW chicken caesar. The waitress asked if having it tossed was okay but when it came it had only had dressing in a big glop in the bottom of the bowl. For $10 it was pretty small and a salad only costs about $1.00 at most w\/o chicken... which was well grilled and tasty but the cheese added was pretty bland as well. Sorry but will choose another Mexican restaurant in the future.This place is absolutely amazing!!! Yummmmmmm very tasty and will have you craving for it the next day !! Waitresses are soooo nice and always full of energy ! Was in there where the stage inspectors went in, and everything was perfect :)My iced mocha was 5 dollars and change but it was sooo good and soo worth it. Do yourself a favor and get your caffeine fix here while in LV.Had a gift card and honestly BROKE right now. The girls at the bar (Señora and Nay) are working their ass off and have looked at me anytime I start to question something, they know before I do. Will definitely be back, minus the gift card.Stopped by today for the lunch buffet after having seen the restaurant many times while driving past McKellips and Scottsdale road. 
The buffet was excellent, well worth the $8 price. The food was some of the best Indian food that I have had anywhere, and I have eaten in several Indian restaurants here in Phoenix, in Tucson, and even in Japan. 
This is going to the top of my favorite restaurants here in the valley, let alone all of Arizona. 
Oh, and if you get a chance to talk to the owner, she is very nice and a great host. 
I would have to say that they service, food, and ambiance are all top notch, don't let the exterior strip mall fool you, this is a great restaurant.This place is clean，noodle is fine，service is bad.Sometimes is so busy，need wait long time.We went here for dim sum on a Sunday. Very busy. The food is good, service not so great. Price is moderate. Different choices for dim sum with carts being rolled around in the restaurant, with items for you to choose from. Everything from shumai to dessert. 
I gave it three stars because it took a while for the shumai to come around. The service is average but not that great. I would come back here for the food, yet you have to come hungry. Still, the dim sum was good, but I have had better.I was having a lovely time at Festival in the Park trying to decide how to give myself an early onset heart attack - ooohh the choices- gyros, fried oreos, fried pies on a stick (maybe that one is made up). I was happy when I saw Sauceman's. You know, that place you always mean to go to. Here it was coming to me!

Dove into the brisket sandwich and some dope (and I don't use the word dope lightly) mac and cheese. They had a choice of three sauces. The one numbed spicy (it was not) I doused my brisket and cheesy mac with. What a satisfying meal. The type of meal where your boyfriend stares you down because he finished eating before you and wants some of your food but instead of asking stares at you with starving wolf eyes until you offer your last two bites for the take of relationship harmony. Ladies, you know the look.

Time to make time to try the banana pudding.I want so badly to leave 4 stars, but I just can't. Perhaps 3 1\/2?

The ambiance here is outstanding. It screams France. Noise level is perfect for intimate conversation.

The food is very good. We had salmon rilette, escargot, chicken, and mussels. We ordered haricot verts, but they never came.

Despite the lack of our vegetable, our service was very good. The server was far from pretentious, but he clearly was a total professional. 

The drinks were great. We had a Manhattan and a Sazerac to start and then wanted to order a bottle of wine to have with our dinner, but it took so long for the server to come back, we went with another cocktail instead.

Overall, I'd recommend coming here. The food is great and the service, despite a couple of hiccups, is good.

This place is pricey, so bring your money.Been here a couple of times now. If I'm looking for halal burger options in sauga, Id pick this over burger factory or hero. My last visit i got the Salsbury Burger - burger patty, mushrooms and gravy I choose to add mozzarella cheese on top. Love their fresh cut fries with malt ....ahhh! Over all open space, fresh meat(saw them pressing the meat while I was waiting for my order) Ps its cash only!! They have an ATM in the store but I recommend coming in with cash, because those charges on the independent ATMs are killer!!Horrible experience.  Took 30 minutes for our order than when I get home the order is wrong.  I wanted the new guardians of the galaxy blizzard and I got cotton candy.  On top of that when we got to the window the guy just sat there with the window closed for 5 minutes. I contacted customer service about this and they did nothing.  I refuse to support this company any longer and I will get my family and friends to follow.  Hopefully bankrupt this entire franchise.  You catch more bees with honey than you do with salt.-confession- 
I've been here 3 times in the last week.

It's very fast and convenient. My family and I can be pretty lazy and this has been our go-to. We always order mapo tofu and fried rice. Considering my dad has Chinese blood in him, he enjoys it. Honestly, it could be a hit or miss... not terrible, just mediocre I guess.

Service: 3 out of 5
They are straight to the point. I respect them for it considering you don't expect great service at Asian restaurant anyway. It's just not in their blood, just saying. Grab your food and go. Honestly no need to small talk. They've never gotten my order wrong. That's important!

Convenience: 5 out of 5
I've called right after I got off work on multiple occasions to order, 10 to 15 minutes later, my food was ready for pick up. They also deliver if you're in the neighborhood (3 miles radius to be exact) with a minimum of $15 order and $2 delivery fee. Doesn't that sound convenient when you're super lazy? I think so! 

Food: 4 out of 5
Like I said in the beginning, it can be a hit or miss. I tried mapo tofu for the first time here and fell in love. I've had it again and again. Sometimes, I eat the whole thing and want more. Sometimes, it doesn't feel worth it or as good as before. Not the worst, not the best, just MEH. If you know what I mean... lol.

Overall: 4 out 5 stars
Why? 
When I'm hangry or in a crunch, they've got my back. I would probably always recommend you pick up or deliver over dining it. But that's just me.Don't eat at the salad bar. It's just filler. Overall, if you are in Vegas, and can get here, you should go. This is a meat lovers dream. So much good food and great, attentive service. Not a place for veagans. The atmosphere is very spacey and open. Hope to eat here again soon.Avanti rocks. Simple. 

I went there for T-day Dinner (and I know, I'm ridiculously late in reviewing this place.) 
The turkey dinner thing they did was awesome. 
The waiters all speak Italian and called me & my mom Bella. 
Our waiter suggested great wines, a white for mom & red for me. Both lovely choices. 

The ambiance alone seriously piqued my curiosity, and I was excited to check it out. People talk about this place. As in, "Yeah, I'm going to Avanti."    "Oooh, Restaurant of Distinction!!"  It's like that. And I was NOT disappointed. Probably the most comfortable booth I've ever sat in. Strangely perfect for dining and staying comfortable at the same time. 

Even the bathroom was cool. They have little velcro covers for the the pipes under the sink. Talk about class. Yes I'm being sarcastic, but at the same time I DUG THEM!!!OMG! To die for.... best best almond croissants. mmmnnnnnn... 
Decent to Good customer service. :D
Pricey but soo worth it!My husband and I decided to try this place and it is hands down the best bbq place we've found. The food was fresh and was excellent value for what we paid. We'll definitely be going back!I tried this place again after bad food experiences in the past, and yet again Flos didn't deliver. The hostesses took our pick up order, but left out our lettuce wraps. When I called to have them charge the order back to my card, the hostess was snippy and told me that they could only take down my phone number so that next time I came in to dine there I could get credit. I won't be going back.Visited on my recent trip to Vegas.  They have a great Northern Larb and Chicken soup with glass noodles.  I was sharing with someone that doesn't eat spicy, so that limited me off of the Northern cuisine.  Would definitely try again.  I felt the service was decent.  The servers seemed stretched out over large areas...maybe because it was on a Sunday??FINALLY a sushi joint on the Danforth that offers BROWN RICE sushi. For a small price more. 

4 stars for that alone. The taste was not the very best, I hope they improve, I will go back because I always feel awful when I eat a lot of white rice.

The AYCE is not worth it for me, I don't eat that much, but I was able to get all I needed at less than the AYCE price, so fine.My favorite Indian Restaurant in the whole wide world!
Every time I go to Vegas, I make sure to stop by there to grab a lunch, yes, lunch not dinner. Lunch is almost half the price of dinner and and they serve the same portion of food. 

My favorite is chicken Mak Markani. I love spicy food so I always ask for INDIAN spicy not AMERICAN spicy when it comes to spice level. 

The decor is just OK. too much brown which makes it gloomy but staff is really nice. Ask to be seated in Abel's section.Terrible location, AC was broken but the pasty was amazing!!  Great local spot food is very well doneI'm not really sure you should call yourself a place that specializes in burgers when the burger meat only comes medium-well.  I take that as either the cook isn't confident enough in his abilities or the management isn't confident enough in the quality of the meat to not poison the clientele.  Because of this, Stack'd automatically lost one star before even I even ordered.  

There are a few other things that Stack'd needs to improve upon.  First, while there is a pretty good Yeungling pitcher special on weeknights, the rest of the happy hour isn't really that great (only $1 off drinks).  Second, apparently there wasn't a server in the upstairs area, so if you want to order food or drinks, you either have to sit at the bar or keep going up to the bar to order.  Third, if it's quiet in the bar, there is some awful game in the back that plays the most annoying little tunes every few minutes.  To some, that might not even be something to notice, but for someone who cringes at loud, unexpected noises like that, I found it unsettling.

Now for the reasons that Stack'd salvages a 4th star... The kitchen is actually open until 1 am, which if you've ever found yourself looking for a damn open kitchen in Shadyside after 10 only to be disappointed, this is a big deal.  The bartender was really friendly and made sure we were well taken care of.  There are many, many TVs (including a TV in each booth) and if you're an out of town football fan who can't get the game at home (think Eagles, Raiders, etc.), you will be able to find your game playing - and you won't even get harassed for not being a Steelers fan.  Finally, the restroom was probably the nicest in Shadyside so that wins big points with me.

Overall, I would most certianly go back, but I truly hope the ownership reconsiders its policy on buger cooking!I wasn't lucky but that aside the burger I had hit the spot.  For 3:15am I was impressed in the food quality.  The plus for Mr. Lucky's is that its open 24\/7 and serves booze.The brisket is AMAZING!

I've eaten at quite a few other bbq places that serve dry, thin layers of beef but this place is the complete opposite.

The brisket was plentiful; thick and tender slices. Normally the bread in any bbq sandwich is a simply a vehicle for the delicious meat but the buns served at this place complement the meat very well (and there slightly toasted which is always a plus!). Lastly, the portion size was also a great bargain for just $12.

I am more of a brisket fan but even the pulled pork and ribs (which I stole from other members of my party) were quite tasty.

Overall I would highly recommend this place; and that is without mentioning the great customer service!The food here is pretty good.  I really enjoy the chicken and waffles.  The service was average.  It's a very busy restaurant on the weekends so we did not see much of our waitress.So all I've really eaten here are the most basic things you can eat for breakfast. Bacon, eggs, sausage, toast and pancakes. I've also had their eggs benedict which wasnt very good. You can't really go wrong with the basic items. Pancakes were so so. They have a breakfast special for the basics 3.99 which you can't beat therefore upping their rating. Overall..not the best place to get food that excites the palate.Best sushi I've had in along time. So fresh.  Staff is friendly and attentive. I am lucky enough to live close by...but it is also worth a drive -- it's that good !My and my girly go here at least once a week for happy hour, and I tell you this...BOMB.COM

Ra has to have the best happy hour around. Top shelf appetizers and tapas, for 5 to 6 bucks? You can load up on delicious grub for a great price, and we do!

The tapas are the best, they are seriously delicious, almost too good.
The salmon carpaccio is spicy and and interesting, it's sashimi salmon with a wasabi lemon aioli sauce and a kick. The albacore with onion and ponzu is ridiculously tasty, and so is the garlic citrus yellowtail. My favorite item on the entire menu and probably the most delicious dish in the world is the Seared Tuna.

THE SEARED TUNA....The seared tuna at Ra is in my opinion the best damned thing I've ever eaten, it's not even an entree and its the best thing there. Lightly seared tuna with micro-greens and pepper, in a little ocean of wasabi ginger sauce. I don't know what magical ingredients or witchcraft Ra uses to make that sauce, but it is off the chain delicious. You could put this sauce on an old shoe and it would taste good.

The calamari and shrimp tempura is delicious and seasoned to perfection, and that's the first time I've been able to say that without laughing. It really is perfect.

I'm hungry typing all of this. Happy Hour at Ra, do it and be happy.The staff was very helpful. Our waitress had obviously been there for awhile and knew what questions to ask to make sure we got what we wanted.  I like my pizza fully cooked and crispy and she even brought it out for me to check before they cut it so they could put it back in if necessary.  Both my and my husband really enjoyed our personal pizzas.  Will go back.Weird setting for a Vietnamese restaurant to be in a 50s diner.  Came in on a rush for lunch to go.  Had my food ready in five minutes.  Pho was very tasty and packaged great.  I will return when I have a little more time to sit down and enjoy.Another great steakhouse in Vegas. 

We came here for a work celebration and I was extremely impressed with the service and food. 

We had reservations and were seated promptly after we arrived. 

The bread basket was amazing. It included bacon and cheese muffin looking bread, pretzel bread and small baguettes. It was accompanied by butter topped with Hawaiian sea salt. Great presentation even better execution. You have to try the bacon cheese bread, it was SOOO good! 

I ordered the New York strip topped with bleu cheese. I ordered it medium rare, it was cooked perfectly. The steak was super flavorful and extremely tender. I highly recommend the New York strip.  

The sides were:

Au Gratin Potatoes: Very flavorful and rich. My only complaint is the portion size is so small. If you have more than three people sharing, order two. 

Crisp Potato Rosti w\/ chive cream: Skip this one, it was like a giant tater tot. No one at the table was very impressed

Poblano & Smoked Bacon Mac n Cheese: This side was really good. Not the best mac n cheese I've ever had but, it was really good. 

Roasted Jumbo Asparagus: You have to order at least one healthy side, right? Well it was healthy until they bathed the asparagus in butter. Don't get me wrong, they were delicious, but no where near healthy. 

Dessert: We ordered the funnel cakes. They were displayed beautifully. The funnel cakes themselves where extremely crispy. I like my funnel cake like I like my woman crispy on the outside and warm and delicious on the inside.... wait what? The dipping sauce were great except for the chocolate. I don't know what they put in it, but it was horrible. I'd skip the funnel cakes next time. 

Service was really good, a couple of times our waitress was M.I.A. but, our drinks were never empty and our empty plates never stayed on our table. 

All in all, this place is great and we will be coming back. If you are in town, give it a whirl.The pink tacos are pink cause of a onion based in beat juice i believe. So the pink onions are very foul tasting. The chicken in the chicken tacos were good. The tortilla soup was not good and neither was the bean dip. guacamole was really fresh and a hint of spice. Got 2 pitchers of sangria sing me and my loved one enjoy it everywhere else but didnt get into a second cup of the second pitcher, WAY TOO MUCH Stuff in the drink to even drink it though a straw.  Good place for a snack but a waste of time and money for a mealI love small mom and pop places that do not disappoint.  Small place but clean and sharp decor. Great service and super great noodles! Too bad it's not walking distance from the strip but worth the $7 Lyft ride!With anticipation of a dog at the famous Pink's, I was disappointed. Remembering my experience at Pink's n Los Angeles, this store was not the same. My Pastrami Dog was topped with the driest shavings of meat. Perhaps if I got it with kraut, it would have been an improvement. Yet, I give it three stars since I dined outside with a view of The Strip.This is our favorite dinner and movie spot. The seating is very comfortable and the food is very good, with great selection. 

We have been here several times and look forward to returning again soon!!!This place is great. Very clean. Food always good. Love the jalapeño hummus, falafels and chicken kabob! Owners are very friendly and always want to make sure you enjoyed your meal.Convenient location if you're in the west gate entertainment area. The food is okay--our group went on taco night, but I had a salad. The food was good but nothing spectacular. Our appetizer mini-chimichangas were a miss. Salsa and guacamole were good. Our service was spotty and it wasn't that busy.  All in all, I would not go out of my way to try this restaurant but it's not terribleI placed a to go order on Uber Eats and just received my order. I ordered the fried chicken and always check my chicken from anywhere before eating. I am so glad I did my chicken was undercooked as in still bleeding!!! If you order from here make sure to check your chicken before eating. I also ordered baked beans but they gave me red beans and rice instead. After seeing the undercooked chicken i didn't even eat the sides so can't review them.Came here for breakfast.  Big room divided up with pillars to avoid the look of a huge cafeteria.  Serve yourself with coffee and juice.  The help staff do a good job of cleaning your table for you as you plow through multiple plates of food.

Good selection for breakfast, plus a ham roast and roasted veggies.  Omelet station for those tired of scrambled eggs.  

You can actually buy an all day pass so you could eat breakfast, lunch and dinner here in the same day.  Holy Gluttony!This has to be the worst late night cafe starting with the hostess who before greeting us began to let us know it would be 20 min or more before our order was taken due to a shift change, my first impression was, she didn't want to be bothered and was hoping that we left instead of waiting. Then came the server Manny, he was the only one that was working the floor maybe that's why his rudeness was over the top. I can't even comment on the food because the service deserves not one star. I have a tip for the management here"You only get one shot at a first impression"..After a long day of work in Las Vegas for business. My coworkers and I decided we wanted to unwind. We chose Mesa Grill, Bobby Flay's restaurant in Las Vegas.
Because we had a large group they shoved us into a private room that was dark and uncomfortable. To top it off, it took them at least an hour and a half for the food to come out. I ordered the steak and decided to share it with my coworker because of the large portion. The meat was tough and not seasoned well. 
Our waitress was overwhelmed and did not keep her composure. She made it awkward for us the entire time we were there. Everytime we asked for something she made it seem like a big chore.
Our meal was expensive and not satisfying at all. I would never return to this restaurant.I had a pretty great experience. Good food - we had samosas to start with lamb shank and risotto and bf had gyro. All so good and service decent.Adding a little class to a Alley. 

Let's be real, nobody likes Alley ball food.  It's mostly chemical preservatives and Gov'ment cheese microwaved within an inch of its life. 

But then there is Red Embers. 

Better then I expected, given the relative low reviews. Though I could t really articulate what I anticipated--a bowling pin cut vertically and steamed to be served like artichoke hearts, a bowling ball burger made with real bowling ball, alley shoes mixed in to the nachos sprinkled with foot powder... 

My imagination runs scared at the thought. 

But nah, we were pleasantly surprised with the Service & Food. 

So much better then Alley-Ball Food. that's why I'm giving this places a thumbs up.Went here on a Sunday morning and despite the hangover, was able to consume all the tasty treats I wanted.  Red velvet pancakes hit the spot and the kalbi and prime ribs were awesome.  It's one of the newest and they do things a lil different that makes it worth trying.  Def worth the $26Location is incredible right on the Etobicoke Waterfront with plenty of parking (used to be free, but now the city installed pay parking).
Always lively and has a great patio area.
The food is decent (great coconut shrimp & sweet potato fries), but my friends weren't pleased with their dishes. 
If you want a lively restaurant with great views on the Etobicoke Waterfront (which there is a dire need for more), you'll enjoy Eden!Great food....A must: onion rings
...Buffalo wings...tatchos...truffle mac & cheese. Not so much of a fan of their chicken tortilla soup.  Right price great food. Btw haven't dined in yet. This is all to go!!! Well worth every pennyGreat up scale place to try new beer and great food! The executive chef is one of a kind greatness in adding his own touch of originality to all the dishes.This place is fantastic! Vicki is such a sweet waitress and the food was amazing and cheap.An underwhelming experience.
Service was good, as you would expect in a nice hotel but food was alright.
Spicy dumpling soup was very limey. Did not like it.
Dragon lobster thai pad was on par. 
I have been pf chang once and i would have not been able to tell the difference except Tao had a fancier interior inside.Love A La Brasa - it's the only authentic and reasonably priced Mexican food restaurant in the downtown area. The meats are flavorful, they don't try to be Tex-Mex, and when you ask for spicy- it's actually spicy.

The service is great whether you sit in, take out, or get delivery.This Just Fresh location is in the bldg where I work making it ultra convenient to run down & grab a bite.  Orders are always fresh & accurate.  The owner & his staff are wonderful & generally know are able to ask if I'm having my usual.  I love the punch card & the double punch Mondays esp given I go every week day.  Service is quick, staff is friendly, location is really clean, & they are very accomodating to special orders.  The salads w\/a roll are large enough that it is the perfect midday solution for a meal - healthy, great service, & in\/out quickly no matter how long the line.Good Italian joint right in the neighborhood.  I understand they make the pasta for Spago, so come here and eat the same thing only cheaper.This is probably one of the best breakfast spots in Vegas! The red velvet pancakes are to die for and the Cinnabon pancakes were delicious also. They need to open a location near my house in Silverado ranch!So.... This is my 4th visit to this place... Love the atmosphere.....2 of 4 visits... Where good.... Drinks... excellent the first 3 times... Tonight really bad.....I used to bartend and whoever is here tonight is....an amateur... Bad mixing.... The customer service lacks a bit.....server seems to have too many tables to be able to give enough attention to his customers... It took way too long to check on us after the food was served and after the drinks.. Which took way too long to be served in the first place....... btw the server multiple times failed to pick up plates we literally sat till the end... As I'm writing this.... With every dish and glass we where served..... They need to polish their service.....Every time I come back to the Grand Lux I get better customer service and pretty yummy food!!!

I had to update my review because of the great customer service I received today, plus that the waitress that previously served me and my boyfriend the other day held onto my debit card that I totally forgot about on the table...the funny part was that I didn't even realize my debit card was missing until she asked if anyone of us had lost our debit card after she acknowledged that she remembered us from the previous day.Food is well made, but not exceptional gourmet, so I cannot see the high price justification, especially when the portions are small. I also find a lot of discrepancies in their menu prices - so be aware of the charges.On my way to the subway station I would drop by the little hole in the wall for an amazing shot of espresso!We ate here last night the place was
packed and considering the place was packed the service was good but as far as the food is considered the food has no flavor I order the steak and chicken Fajitas and the meat had no flavor it wasn't seasoned at all it was flat and considering it was a 20 dollar meal by itself I expected better also my wife's flautas dinner combination with beef tacos as well had no flavor, it's pretty bad when the best tasting thing of the meal was the beans. Won't ever try this place ever again. The 2 stars was for the service because the service was good but the food sucked.I really am passing by on our way to minnesota. Just off the highway took mins excellent choice. Very clean food was good  pie are excellent. Chances are you'll find lots of Norwegian people  can't have everything.  Yes I am SwedishMy wife and I were intrigued by this place branding itself as a seafood place so we decided to try it. The restaurant  looks like slightly fancier version of Olive Garden and is in fact frequented by several old customers. We ordered a tasting menu which consisted of appetizer, one main course, and one dessert. We both ordered the trout soup and the linguine with mussels and lobster. For dessert I had the cheese platter and my wife had the bread pudding. The soup was fairly standard, I will say cafeteria quality. The linguini tasted not the bad but nothing special either. Some of the mussels were not fully open and fully cooked which was pretty bad. My cheese player had a single slice of cheese which was pretty disappointing. 

PROS
- pretty good price for a tasting menu
- not many good restaurant in this location

CONS
- cheesy decor
- you can get more interesting food at most downtown restaurants fur the same priceSmall burger, no real flavor - very bland. Fries were good while hot, as someone said, they don't have that greasy feeling. 50\/50 - too much lemonade, no tea flavor\/color at all - induced heartburn.

Won't go again, wished I hadn't - $12.50 - overpriced.

Smash Burger and Five Guys make much better burgers.I sat at the bar. The menus are confusing because there are two, a pub and grill menu.  I heard from a friend that I should try the Pork Belly.  I reviewed the pub menu but I had my mind set on the pork belly.  So I asked about it, and the bartender had to gave me the grill menu,  Two menus didn't make sense.  I probably should have been given a choice or at least told there are two menus.  I will often eat "dinner" at a bar not just bar food.  So I ordered the Pork Belly.  Unbelievabe.  It was unique, extremely flavorful but surprisingly light.   That coupled with the bar tenders attentive service and the great selection of beers it was a good night out.   In the future please consolidate the menu into grill and pub so I don't miss out on any great food offerings.I love the wings here but the service is always so Slow! I call my order in so that I don't have to wait 20 min for my food and they never have it made... On top of that back in my day I paid $4.25 for a dozen wings, I get prices have changed, but now I am paying $7.95 for approximately 1lb of wings?? Approx? Seriously? And $2.00 for ranch? Who doesn't like ranch with wings?! But for $2.00?! I feel
Robbed.Down-to-earth authentic Mexican food - reasonably priced and simply prepared.  Excellent chips and salsa with a variety of options. Beware their measures of spiciness may be different than yours - moderate per their description is not so moderate to me. But, they are nonetheless delicious and offer a whole spectrum of salsas. Tacos were likewise fantastic - the chorizo were the star of the meal. This place also has excellent margaritas - not the cheap frozen style mind you. Ambience is great once you make the trek through the mildly scary staircase... Clean with excellent service.Came here Sunday for lunch with my mom. Normally we have great service but today was very slow. One lady seemed like she just didn't want to be there but who really wants to be at work? I had some garlic chicken dish that was yummy and served with white rice. My mother has the pad woon sen which is her go to and always yummy. Had a nice relaxing lunch. Will definitely be back. Love the decor.This is the new bar from the guys who brought the magnificent Bar Marco to Pittsburgh. The Livermore doesn't disappoint. This is a cool bar with great craft cocktails and tasty snacks. In East Liberty. This is the new hip neighborhood in Pittsburgh and these guys are here early. On night one the place was standing room only--a great sign of things to come. 

The menu features a few specialty cocktails plus a list if classics. They also have a couple of wines by the glass and beer (bottled). The food menu is simple--crostini, salad, small sandwiches, bar snacks. The food is tasty but not complicated. You probably will come here for drinks and happen to get some food, not the other way around. That's not to say that the food isn't very good ( it is), but when everyone's having a rollicking good time and the bar is cranking out perfectly mixed craft cocktails somehow food can take a back seat in one's mind. 

Check it out. You won't be disappointed! This is a great addition to not only East Liberty but also Pittsburgh more broadly.My husband and I had dinner and drinks here, as well as Sunday brunch. The Mexican food is mexicali at it's best! Fresh, warm chips greet you as you wait for your meal and I enjoyed a yummy sangria margarita. They have a nice meal option where you can select from multiple entrees. Food was hot and delicious! Brunch has only a few options available for the meal, but both of ours were very good. One slight downfall was the orange juice served with the mimosas seemed of poor quality. But for a drink special, I overlooked it. Excited to go back again!Visited this place Thursday night 5\/10\/12 around 7:30 pm.  The restaurant seemed busy but we were seated right away in a booth in the back of the restaurant.  My wife and I ordered 2 beers but they were out of both of them, bummer!!!! Oh well, plenty of others to choose from.  We shared a wedge salad, excellent bacon dressing on it.  Also had some oysters, which at 2 bucks a piece were a good value.  Wife had the lobster rolls, which were very good.  I had a burger with pastrami on it.  Cooked perfectly, really tasty.  Service was excellent, food was great, atmosphere was a little noisy but it is a pub.  Prices were a little high, but it is in a prime location on the strip, and the prices were actually better than all of the places in City Center.  All in all a very good dining experience.I hate the area that's it's in... the food is ok, but when your walking around to look for a table their all dirty.. carpet is filthy.... games are fun! We were walking to our car when some kids walking by start throwing rocks at the cars... yes it hit my car!! I called 911 but by then kids were gone! Soo pissed!Solid independent coffee shop with a pretty cool collection of employees. Coffee shop was cool. WiFi a bit slow but good enough for emails but could pose a problem if you're really trying to work remotely. 

Coffee was cool. Pastries were cool. 
I'd come back if I was in the area, but I wouldn't stop my search for a mobile office with this location.I was in the Henderson location for lunch today.  I saw that you had chips and guac listed on your menu for 9.95 and then a picture next to it showing the Daddy's Chip Plate.  The only thing added was the queso.  I figured that since there was no price mentioned it could't be much more then just the guac.  WRONG!  I was charged 18 dollars and feel completely ripped off.  I dont think I will be going back even though the food was very good.  Not right to not post prices and then charge an arm and a leg for chips!The pizza was great and the space was perfect for my one and three year old. We celebrated my daughter's birthday there and she had a blast and felt very special.Hadn't been for about a year, long story short, wasn't comfortable in the parking lot.  But that has all changed now!  And SO GLAD we went back.  Had a craving for the cheesesteak, you can't find anything else like it here in Vegas.  Being from the Philly area, I know this for a fact.  Anyway, there are new owners now and they are awesome!  They are friendly and the food is even better than before (if that is even possible)...  Portions are very (very) generous.  Now this is back in the lunch rotation, so glad we went back!The five star ratings for this restaurant must  be fake! We have been fans of the chain for years. This was the worst experience we have ever had. The food was awful, my grilled salmon was over cooked and tasteless, my wife's sausage and pasta dish was
Inedible. I tried to get a fresh cup of coffee but gave up after the second attempt. Our waitress was uninterested and almost rude. Will NEVER return to this location. A real shame as I said we have enjoyed their other locationsGreat place! I have been coming here since the first week they opened.  Pizza is excellent and service is top notch. Owners are great people.  A small place with welcoming atmosphere.Love jimmy johns but SO ANNOYED that they don't deliver to where I live. Been waiting a year for them to expand delivery zones. I live 2.5 miles away.... don't see why they can't deliver. That's what they brag about the quick delivery of delicious food well kind of missing out on the delivery part.I am in Las Vegas for work about 6X\/year and yesterday I wanted a good cup of coffee and a breakfast snack.  Boy, did I land at the right place!  Great, friendly service; excellent coffee and the Breakfast Bombness is just that.  The Americano was great with a nice caramel colored foam on the top.  Hope I will be in the neighborhood again on future trips.  Nice work from this cohesive team.This place is awesome!!  I never have a problem with my food, totally consistent.  Even had a friend who can't have anything gluten, she did the grilled veggies, but had to ask about the vinegrette.  The server and chef were kind enough to check it out!!  Great service, awesome food!  The hot dogs are huge and flavorful, fries to die for, cheesecake i'm in love with.  Can't go wrong with this place!!!I love the food, but wish Restaurant Impossible would come in and completely re-decorate the inside. It's dark, dirty, crowded, and out dated. Get rid of everything off the walls.  Also the parking is a nightmare.This was by far the worst experience in a restaurant setting yet. We are a party of 13 so we made a reservation for 6:30pm. Checked in and they were not ready for us until 7 pm. We are seated there are two pitchers of water but no glasses. We wait patiently and no one comes over so after 15 min I go to the hostess and ask if a server has been assigned to us. Almost 30 minutes before a server comes over to take our drink order, we ask for glasses for the water. The server says she will bring them over we are now ready to order. She takes the order and forgets to go around the whole table and walks away. Now keep in mind it is now 7:29 pm we have been at our table for 1\/2 hour and still no cups for water all though the water is on the table. We chase the server down to tell her she didn't take all the orders, server takes the rest of the orders and walks away, still no glasses for water. I go back to the hostess and ask for a manager, a few minutes later the manager comes to the table as the server is dropping of drinks and the manager asks the server if everything is good. I speak up and say no it's NOT, I begin to tell him that it's unacceptable to be at a restaurant for more than 1\/2 hour and not have anyone see if we have been helped or a server come over to take our order. We ask if our food is already made he says no we say cancel the order and give us our bill for the drinks. Manager says let me get you appetizers while you wait for your food. Seriously, you can't get anyone to take our order and you want to make us happy with appetizers " no thank you". I proceed to tell him we are leaving and I would like your regional managers number. I am in the industry and have been for over 15 years, you don't treat customers like this ever. It is a competative market and all we had to do was cross the mall and have dinner at Buffalo Wild wings.. to give you an idea how long everything took my husband and daughter were able to meet us for dinner. They were in Quartside when we were headed to The Old Spaghetti Factory.Breakfast at this place is great!  Super fast and friendly!!  They give you a lot of food and it is pretty inexpensive.  I love hash browns and they were perfect, a little crispy on the outside and wonderful on the inside.  the only way this place could be better for breakfast is if the Sausage Gravy Biscuits were a little less floury tasting and spicier (think Bojangles here).  We will definitely be back.This location also has Pizza Pit pizza and ice cream.  They seem to make Pizza Pit pizza if it's a thin-crust order or Pizza Extreme if it's a stuffed-pizza order.  Pizza Pit were a big deal in Madison pizza around 15 years ago.  Then it almost completely disappeared around 1999-2000... when Pizza Extreme and Papa John's came to town.  Pizza Pit has a tasty sauce and distinctive crust.  The toppings and cheese are pretty decent quality.  Pizza Extreme's stuffed pizza is pretty good too.  And it's nice to get them by the slice.  I haven't tried the ice cream or the sandwiches, but it's nice to have that... it sort of rounds out that shopping center.  Chinese food, pizza, sandwiches, and ice cream.I don't give 5 stars often, but this one hit the sweet spot, so it deserves.
Was in town just for a few hours and was comping back from the nearby Neon Sign museum and boneyard when I noticed this corner food truck and stopped.  Asked the folks on line ahead of me and got some suggestion. Got the pork and chicken tacos ($2) and a large beverage of hibiscus tea ($2.50).  Didn't care much for the pork taco, but the chicken taco was superb, as it seemed it was marinated into a hot spicy sauce and it had a unique zest.  Wish I had such a food truck back home.  In thinking about it, I feel that the real trick in making a great taco is to have a great corn taco, made with great ingredient and fresh and almost crunchy.The only reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 was because of how eerily quiet it was and the price relative to portion size. We were a party of four and there was only one other party which happened to be a family sitting across the room..which I found strange for a Saturday evening. I ordered the Roasted Organic Chicken and it happened to be quite tasty and pretty good on price. I can't say the same about the Steak Au Poivre, however.This place is definitely a hole in the wall. I do agree that the food is a bit pricey for being a local "Pho" spot but I would say the quality of their food makes up for it. Taro boba was delicious. Ordered egg rolls for appetizers and it was a bit different from what you would encounter at Pho Saigon. Crispier and smaller but indeed delicious. Second dish was the bun thit nuong which for those of you who don't know means rice noodles with grilled meat. I enjoyed this dish very much as it was very filling with the combination of meat and greens. Absolutely delicious. It is a new spot so it is clean and the server was extremely kind. Overall it is a solid establishment.. Definitely will come back to try different things on their menu!After trying many of the Mexican restaurant chains in the greater Phoenix area, I figured it was my duty to try this one out. I tend to favor the taco shops that offer seafood, which they do and a whole lot more. The menu is overwhelming to be honest, but the staff is helpful so that's a plus. 

The decor\/ambiance is nothing to write home about, but it is clean which is a plus in my book and all that matters. We ordered the fish rolled tacos (5), the shrimp corn tacos and chips, guacamole and salsa. 

Unfortunately they got the rolled taco order wrong, it turned out to be beef, but they had no issues re-making the order with fish so I have to give them credit on handling that well. Just remember, if your rolled tacos come out with guacamole, tomatoes and cheese you've got beef ones, and if they come out with crema and red and green cabbage and tomatoes you have the fish ones. 

The rolled fish tacos were good, but I wouldn't order them again. The corn tacos were crisp, the toppings were good, BUT the fish was buried in all the flavors that I couldn't tell you what was in them. 

I enjoyed the shrimp tacos the most, they were perfect with plenty of shrimp filling and seasoned just right (though I favorite the ones at Rubio's just a bit more). 

The corn chips were crisp and fresh and a generous bag, with lots of leftovers. I did not care for the medium red salsa it came with one bit. I'm not sure if it's a one off, but it was as watery as tomato juice (maybe even more so). The green salsa was much better, and I'm so thankful I got guacamole because it was a lot tastier and didn't just roll off the chips. 

All and all it was a good stop for Mexican food, but I feel I'd have to try at least a handful more items from the menu to give my final feelings about the Senor Taco chain.Food was great.
We had Patlican Ezme (Baba Ghanoush) and Anatolia Mixed Plate.
Grilled dish came with rice and salad, portions were good.
The service was wonderful. We went there for a early birthday celebration for my friends. Our waiter over-heard we talked about her birthday, gave us Keskul with candle on house.
Turkish coffee was muddy and strong, it was bitter but with a hint of sweet in it.Omg. We waited for ever and a day for a drink. 
Problem was that a new guy was working the register (which already took forever) and he had no idea how to make the iced coffee coolatta so after reading the directions on the machine, he just left the cup there. I figured someone else would make it. Nope. 10min later we said "hey could someone make my drink "

Ugh.The place gives you a warm and genuine feeling of Tibet out of Tibet. We were a party of 5 and reached 15 minutes before our reservation. Garab the owner who runs the show took charge immediately by accommodating us in a fully packed place. It didn't take long till we were seated and Garab wouldn't stop apologizing for something which wasn't an inconvenience for us.

He waited on us and gave us really good suggestions on Tibetan cuisine.

Chicken momos and chilli fries were the highlight of our meal. Food on the whole was really good and the customer service was even better. I can't remember getting such great service at a fine dining restaurant.

They also have a big patio that accommodates around 60 people. Unfortunately it was a bit chilly to enjoy an outdoor patio meal. However come summer I'm gonna look forward to another amazing experience at Tibet Kitchen.

Big thanks to Garab and his team for looking after us. He sets an amazing example on how to deliver the goods in the best possible way ever.Pathetic food. We ordered chilly chicken, chicken momos, dal makhni, karahi chicken and bhunna ghost. All except chilly chicken was worse indian you could have. First, waiter forgot our order. Bhunna ghost was uncooked. Karahi chicken had excessive salt. Dal was bland. One of the worst meal I ever had in US. Breads were not up to the mark. Washrooms were in bad condition. 
What else do you expect from a resturant. 
Eat at your own risk !!I was really happy with this buffet.  They have a Groupon for $16 each and you get unlimited mimosas & the buffet. I thought the food was really good and they had a great variety.I was pleasantly surprised with this place. Didn't get any drinks or see any live entertainment, just dinner.

Yes, it's cheesy looking and touristy, looks like a wannabe Rainforest Cafe... But I give 4 stars only because the food was really good, and because we were given a $20 off coupon in the casino. Otherwise, I probably wouldn't have wanted to pay full price for this restaurant.. Woulda rather gone somewhere nicer if that were the case. But regardless, it was a good deal, and service was decent. I got what I think was called the cajun chicken pasta--VERY good, and I'm a serious pasta lover. The boyfriend got the steak and shrimp with mashed potatoes, he enjoyed it. Came with a purple orchid on the plate. I put it in my hair when we left. :D Total with the coupon came out to be about $29.00.

As mentioned before, this place is a little too touristy for my liking, so I would go elsewhere for drinks unless you don't mind a cheesy atmosphere... But the food was really good, didn't have to wait too long, and it was a great deal. Definitely go if you have the $20 off coupon.. Otherwise, might be a little too pricey.Great sushi! My boyfriend and I go for sushi pretty often and order several rolls and pretty much eat til we feel sick. We ordered sushi pizza and 6 rolls. The waitress told us that was too much food, and to order 4 rolls. We thought this was a bit weird, but went ahead with 4 rolls and our pizza and would order more if we wanted. The waitress was right! We could hardly finish the 4 rolls we ordered! The rolls are huge, I've never seen sushi that big before. And the sushi pizza, omg. There's spicy mayo and cream cheese on it. The cream cheese is what really makes it good. This is now our go to sushi place, which is great because it's close by. I've also ordered for take out and my order is always done quick!The food was good. The service was nice. Anything I asked about whether what's in the food or the deal of the day. The waitress was nice to tell me or go find out if she didn't know. It kinda sucks that the restaurant is near construction but it's not their fault. However, I would come back if I was in the area shopping.Came here with my mom and was not disappointed. Their burgers are wonderful. They have homemade chips that are to die for! 
Customer service was a little slow, but still nice.
Definitely worth going back to!Returned again, bringing my NY style pizza loving bf. We got seated at a table with a fantastic window view of the Wynn. We got started with a personal size pesto pizza with meatballs and mushrooms and a small pizza with pepperoni and italian sausage. Trust me when I say the small isn't really small. Very tempted to order the pizza of the month, the prosciutto pizza, but I can't say no to pesto. Pizzas were just as good as I remembered. Our server Ty was awesome, making sure we were okay and keeping our drinks filled. I made sure to leave room for dessert, so an order for the Bailey Irish Creme Cheesecake was placed. I can't believe I didn't know they had dessert available. It's definitely not on the menu online! Very decadent and yummy! 

This place is just as good as the NY original and I'm stoked they have a location in SoCal (El Segundo!). I'm also in love with their decor---empty wine bottles as hanging light fixtures? Amazing.Very affordable and everything was tasty. BYOB    and great selection of classic Korean bbq and more esoteric options. Very affordable.We went on Easter. it was not crowded. it is a general store, Gas Station Post Office, restaurant and liquor store all in one. very friendly people very quick service tasty food. pancakes are very big. The pancake combo breakfast comes with one pancake which is more than enough but you do have the option to add a second pancake. It has a more homestyle friendly Cracker Barrel type restaurant feel to it.This is my favorite place to eat Sushi in town. They are so inventive! The Foo Burger is total Amazeballs. You might ask them not to charbroil if you aren't a fan of that slightly char taste. I know a lot of people are. 
The Nachos are to die for! My mom is a total nacho snob and she loves the twist of the spicy tuna on it. The ramen is good but super messy. 
The best sushi roll I've tried is the Lasagna. Best sushi I've ever had in my life. All their sushi is great, it's fresh and their chefs actually know what they're doing. But the Lasagna is to die for. Total foodgasm. 
Their drinks are great and the staff is super friendly. Justine is a total cool chick. Love her. And our waiter was a total sweetie. I don't remember his name but he had several tats and a rhinestone stud in his face. Totally a great guy and was super patient with my nosy (slightly cheap) mother. 
Total must go!!!A couple of weeks ago I went to the Thursday prime rib dinner. It was quite good.  My sister and I decided we would try the Lake Erie Perch dinner next. We did this last Friday. I even hesitated giving it a 1 star it was that bad. We were given a free bowl of clam chowder with the dinner.  We were served a no clam, no potato, with a vinegar tasting white liquid in lieu of clam chowder. Awful. The perch were stuck together and tasted of old oil.  Some things seem to be ok there but do not order the "lake erie perch" fry.Love this place. The staff is super friendly. The food is great. And inexpensive. Order anything from a bowl of Pho to salt and pepper shrimp and it is first rate.Cheesecake factory's a solid. I got the shrimp scamp and steak duane. I keep trying to write Diane and it keeps saying Duane. Now I'm gonna google steak Duane cause I like all different names of steak. It was amazing! And the crab bites (6 bites) Zucchini fries, hubs got Louisiana chicken pasta or something, and Adams peanut butter cheesecake. I mean the wait right?? The parking right?? We all know this right? Staff always nice. Can't comment on the bathroom situation, didn't visit. Tho I enjoyed cheesecake tv while i waited. 

We went on a Saturday arriving at like 4:15pm 45. Minute wait. Pretty much spot on. 

Ok.. Here's the prob.... While I was waiting! People! Get up! Get up and let and old person sit down! How about seriously a 75 year old grandpa? Nope How bout an old man with a cane??? Nope Oh... Oh... Mr young meathead? Sat there the whole time girlfriend stood in uncomfortable boots? Good grief. Grandpa with kid on shoulders? Stood. Mother holding child and purse? Stood. Couple in thirties sat the whole time playing clash of clans oblivious to themselves, each other and their surroundings. 

Cheesecake Factory always a solid. Humanity??? Not so much.Now this place is the ultimate winner, not only is it already on my list of favorite Mexican restaurants in Phoenix here, it also is worthy of being the #1 taco spot on this list! Ta Carbon is a delicious Mexican place, and their tacos are amazing as well! I mean just look at the picture, pictures don't lie! They are so casual and focus completely on the food, that it's really not shocking that their tacos are some of the best in the valley. Plus their name is hilarious if you speak Spanish$13.83 for a Tosted mac & cheese No meat.... but they charge like if it had shrimp!   I won't order this again. .. over priced, small portion,  and it's not even the best I ever had.Ordered beef hash and spice chicken sandwich. The food was good with big portions. Couldn't eat it all. Staff was friendly. Best food spot we could find nearby that wasn't fast good. Prices were moderately priced.This place has turned into a real dive.  My wife and I used to go every Friday or Saturday night for  about  eight years starting back around 2003 but pretty much stopped going because the food quality really took a turn for the worse.  We have still gone there occasionally but pretty much for the cheap drinks but the food, if per chance served hot, was usually palatable but pretty much lacking in quality and taste.  
A few nights ago we went with some out of town friends because they love margaritas and it was .99cent night.  I'll make a long story short.  Three of us ordered chimichangas and they appeared to have been reheated in the oven because they were burnt so badly they were actually black on top.  Although I sent mine back I could tell that my guests were embarrassed for me and went ahead and ate part of theirs anyway.  After about 25 minutes I was served another burnt chimichanga and now I was embarrassed so made the best of it.
When I went to pay the bill I gave the hostess my credit card which she swiped while I was complaining about our experience.  She returned my credit card and said she understood and would not charge anything on the card.  She then came to our table  had me sign a receipt for 0.00.
Now for the clincher, a few days later there was a charge on my credit card for the full amount of the bill!   I called the establishment to complain and was told a manager or the owner would return my call.  That was a couple of days ago and I've heard nothing.  Of course I'm going to attempt to have my credit card company reverse the charge but hopefully you now have some idea of the type of establishment this place has turned into.Nope.  Won't go back! Food was just mediocre.  Didn't bring us half of our order.  Waitress was terrible.  Didn't check on us.  We had to go find her.  Music was wayyyyyy too loud to be enjoyable.  We couldn't wait to get out of here!It's disappointed. The name of shop sounds like Japanese owned shop, but the taste was way too far to Japanese proper RamenCocktails are good, but not as strong as I would like, lol. 

Cauliflower appetizer was surprisingly delicious. A strong citrusy flavor. With some asparagus and eggs on top. 

Caesar salad was generic, but good.

Bolognese was savory and tasty. 

Strozzapreti felt a tad dry. The chicken was still overpowering the other ingredients imho.This is the best Red Robin!!! My family's go to spot. Awesome service and delicious food. Never disappointedMy MIL suggested this place to try after reading about it in the food section of the newspaper. I'm always up for trying new places. We came on a Saturday at 5pm, it was not busy at all and was able to call ahead to make a reservation just in case. The waitress was super friendly and asked if we have been there before, as we haven't  gave us time to look over the menu and answered our questions. Once you are ready to order, you go to the counter to place your order. Once the food is ready they will bring it to your table. We started with the lettuce wrapped spring rolls and salt and pepper calamari. Both was super delicious- the spring rolls were made with rice paper and came out hot, crispy and flavourful and the calamari was nicely battered and the dipping sauce paired great with it. I got the beef, chicken and shrimp vermicelli and added a spring roll with it since it didn't come with it.  I really enjoyed everything and would recommend this place.With tip, my 50 minute aromatherapy massage was $200, and that was a 15% tip.  The staff was OK, either really young and wanted to get back to chatting or did not speak much english, and hey, this is one place I'd like people to be able to communicate with me well.

Anyway, it was a decent massage, but seemed shorter than 50 minutes since I was already changing 50 minutes after they started and there was a lot of chit chat before the massage.  Not saying it's a terrible place, but I have had far better massages for just over half that price in high end places in Chicago.

The one redeeming quality is that after my OK massage I could hang out as long as I wanted in the facilities, and the sauna, aromatherapy room and igloo room were very nice ways to finish relaxing.Earl of Sandwich..

MmMmm...
*burp*Casa Del Sol serves up pretty good Mexican grub. It's not the most authentic joint but that can have its advantages. By this I mean a bigger menu, bigger portions, tons of cheese, and most importantly good drinks. They also have a great kids menu. For instance: You want to go out for Mexican and your younger children don't want to. No worries! They can get chicken strips or macaroni and cheese here. What a smart idea. Not something you will find at some of the more authentic joints in town.Amazing experience at Dickey's BBQ today!  We came in here for the first time since it's opening and the customer service from the second we walked through the door was outstanding!!   The food was so good!   We will definitely be coming back here!!   Thanks for going the extra mile to be extra kind to the kids and make them feel welcome in your restaurant!Came here on a whim but oh was I impressed not only with the food, the freshness, the service, just and overall great experience. The only negative was it was more people than seats. A great problem to have. The Dominican burrito was hot and fresh from beginning to end. And the empanadas was good too! Come check it out!Oh my gosh, my husband and I decided to give the new Webb Custom Kitchen a try for dinner this evening, and what a wonderful decision.  First, the restaurant is absolutely beautiful.  You feel that you have stepped into another world.  Second, you are met with friendly, welcoming staff.  After taking in the beauty of your surroundings, you then begin to eat, drink and enjoy.  We started with the Angry Lobster Appetizer (delectable); then I had a rack of baby back ribs (do yourself a favor and order the two racks) with the mashed potatoes (all so indescribably delicious there is no way to put it into words, but trust me....delicious).  My husband had the spiced tuna dish, and again, it is hard to put into words just how yummy the flavors are in this scrumptious dish.  There is no need to drive to Charlotte in search of outstanding food and ambiance, it is now in our little town of Gastonia.Stopped at this place with a Groupon a few years ago and it was great then and still great now. Small place seating under 20...a little more in the summer with picnic tables outside. Seems to do a great takeout business...I love that, too.  
Server recommended the crab rangoon as the "best ever" and fresh rolls with tofu. Neither one disappointed...she was spot on the Rangoon. Very light and crisp with enough filling. The fresh rolls are my favorite around.
I've had the pad Thai, pumpkin, green, red and yellow curries. Spice level is accurate. All meals are very fresh and plentiful.
Why don't I live within walking distance?I wish I had known about this place sooner, as it's epic. Came here for a work function and was amazed at the food and the service. We got a huge table upstairs, as there was 12 of us and were seated promptly and ready to go. 

Out of the 12 there is me, the super annoying celiac and another two that are intolerant. The server knew the menu and what was gluten free, and what substitutions could be made to make it gluten free, I went with the damn good burger, which was damn good. I was only able to eat half of it, as it was huge. 

We did have a couple mix up with the other two GF peeps, in regards to the pizza. But the server was fantastic, she took the pizza away and got another one ready just to ensure it was in fact a GF pizza. The manager even came over to make sure everything was good and all our orders had been sorted out.Place is ok for a quick beer or some bar food. Friday night fish fry isn't even in the same ballpark as Irish Wolfhound though. Saw a few posts saying good things about fish fry so thought we would give it a shot. Major disappointment. Friendly atmosphere though.Great tasty pizza 
I noticed on the internet that this place is now open on Sundays as well and wanted to give it a try. 
Amazing customer service and great tasty pizza. 
Thank you Frankie'sPlaces needs more servers or a better way to take care of their busy times. I sat in the bar to avoid the 30 min wait for a table. Mistake! One server was handling the full bar and patio. We all suffered. When the manager was approached by another customer, she seemed unaware of what was going on. She did approach tables to ask about the wait and acted accordingly, so that was good.

I think the food is decent. Be honest, after awhile all basic Mexican food pretty much tastes the same. Beans are beans. Rice is rice. Seriously? If someone took the pictures from various Mexican restaurants at this level (Gracias,Macayos etc) and asked you to match the dish to the restaurant, we'd all probably fail.Lousy attitudes, not really care about what we order. I heard more cup, spoon, and chop sticks dropping. Kind of like accident happening. 

We order fresh spring rolls.. OMG, so tiny!
Smaller than Philippine longanisa with only one small piece meat and one small shrimp.

My party and I ask for some lemon\/lime, server walked away with "WE HAVE NO LIME! NO LIME TODAY!" 

WHAT KIND OF PHO RESTAURANT WITH NO LEMON\/LIME!?

In case anyone wondering, There is a large "Asian 168 grocery store" near by the restaurant in the same shopping center.

Over all, food is not impressed. Seafood noodle has only one piece of shrimp and one piece of squid, some beef-like meat!  Vermicelli cold noodle with no taste chicken\/pork and tiny egg rolls even longanisa is bigger than that.


I highly not recommend this pho restaurant whom ran out of lime!

DO NOT COME HERE IF YOU NEED LEMON\/LIME FOR YOUR PHO!Excellent sushi place for Pittsburgh - best I've found yet.  (Please don't expect West Coast sushi - I did qualify my statement by saying "for Pittsburgh".  I usually have to do this for Pittsburgh restaurants.)  Sushi was a little loosely prepared, but the fish seemed very fresh, and the presentation was nice.  

The service was excellent, too.  Our waitress was very friendly, fast, and helpful.Delicious!  This is the perfect place for lunch.  My husband and I shared the sampler plate.  I could eat the olives and almonds all day.  The grapefruit agua fresca was also really great!  Very casual, but very charming.went there 3 weeks ago... good food... good place to hang out .. try out all that fresh sushi..!!! little expensive but got to pay what you you getSo so so good! We had garlic naan, chicken tikka masala, raita, rice and tandoori chicken. Everything was seriously wonderful. Great service and nice ambience. Will definitely return!I ordered total of 14 dishs to go for a party. It was a huge disappoinment. Will never go back again. Definately overated by Yelp.The food here is horrible, food was dry and unflavorful. Food took awhile cause they only had one guy doing all the cooking. I don't recommend this place not a place I'm going back to eat.I think they need to improve their dishes as the fish and chicken are too dry.  Last time I saw a lot of flies at the dessert bar.I LOVE coming here! I even had Babbo cater my wedding it's that wonderful! Ann is the best waitress Ever she totally will spoil you! The pesto is the best-o!!  Chocolate cheesecake was to die for! I recommend coming here every time you want to go out to dinner!Not a huge fan of their pizza, but the Chicken Parmesan Calzone is delicious, and their service is excellent!We've always been huge fans of Roman Candle pizza in Middleton so we were excited to see them open a place in our neighborhood!    Now we are only a short walk to their fabulous housemade roasted red pepper soup, a great pizza, and some Chocolate Shoppe ice cream for dessert (yes, it is right inside the restaurant!)  The Monroe Street location has a different vibe than their other places.  They successfully pull off having a fresh, modern, casual cocktail bar type design yet still very family friendly - especially in the back.  Looks like they will have outdoor seating in the summer.Moriah our server was amazing! Her menu knowledge, patience and personality helped my friends and I have a great time!!! Will definitely be back!!Very tasty.  Got the Chips and Guacamole and the chips are incredible.  Made in house, hot and crunchy.  Also got the Carnitas Torta and while a little heavy on the mayo, a very good sandwich.  Got it with the green salsa which is also great.  Atmosphere is basic and it's almost self-serve.  Very casual place.  Definitely see myself returning.Believe the good ratings and reviews on Postino's. The Bruschettas are simply amazing - my favorite has to be the smoked salmon and pesto. I've been to this location and the one in Gilbert and I would have to say that this location is my favorite.

I came here for brunch on a Sunday morning to meet up with some people a little after nine. They arrived before me and apparently most, if not all of the patio seating outside had already been taken. If that doesn't speak for how popular Postino's is then I'm not sure what does. They have a good food list for brunch as well - ordered the Country Toast which was excellent with portions bigger than expected. As for their wines they are simply stellar. You can tell that they have an extensive tried and tested wine list and it definitely shows.

The service here is really good. The people working here are very friendly and helpful willing to give you suggestions on what to try. I really enjoy every visit to Postino's and I look forward to coming back!Friday Night Wings & Beer Were Bomb! Great customer service, thanks Alexa you made our night. We will be back :)Hyakumi Japanese Restaurant & Sushi Bar offers great fresh sushi and Teppanyaki (hibachi) at Caesars Palace. While visiting Vegas for my bachelor party, some of my friends and I wanted to get sushi while we were in town, so we ended up at Hyakumi for dinner. We were seated at a teppanyaki grill and introduced to our awesome chef! 

We were served delicious cups of hot and cold sake and Japanese beer. We each ordered a sushi roll, fried rice, and chicken or beef hibachi. The sushi was sensational. The fish was fresh and colorful. The spicy tuna was my favorite. Nigiri is also served. Combined with the hand cut rolls, there are nearly 40 different varieties. The hibachi was amazing as well. I got teriyaki chicken that was perfectly cooked, juicy and flavorful.

The girls and I enjoyed doing sake bombs and joking around with our grill master as he lit things on fire, made a lava volcano from perfectly diced onions, and flipped his weapon of choice (spatula) in the air. 

All in all, we had a wonderful time! The food and atmosphere was great, so I wouldn't mind coming back for more sushi the next time I'm in town!Very nice place to go before or after Any sporting event . Easy walk to Mellon Arena and new Consol Energy Center . Adjacent to Duquesne University . Good food and nice bar selection . The place can get very crowded before Penguin games so arrive early . No reservations . Make sure you chech on their hours . It seems they follow the schedule for Duquesne so don't assume they will be open .These sandwiches are amazing. Cool spot, super friendly staff and awesome addition to downtown Phoenix. Cuban cigar and the Seoul sandwich took storm on my pallet. I will be back and with friends this time as you can pop around to grab drinks as well in the same area. A+ for the ideasThis has authentic Italian cuisine.  I recommend this restaurant to customers if they want a great meal. The hostess Joanne always greets us with a friendly and welcoming attitude. Thanks for the great food and wonderful service!What a fantastic and fine culinary experience!  This was one of my first ultra-fine dining dinners and I will remember it forever. 
The cuisine was prepared beautifully, delecately seasoned, with little surprises around every corner (ie. boiled bone marrow up top my venison). The staff was attentive and caring. The sommelier was the best part of the dinner! With each dish was a perfectly paired wine along with a in depth explanation of the wine and why it was chosen for that dish. That sommelier will forever hold a place in my heart for introducing me to one of my all time favorite wines, Hungarian Royal Tojkai (which was paired with foie gras). Overall the experience was so lovely, especially being able to dine in the presence of such amazing works of art, anyone looking for an ultra luxurious Vegas dinner should try Picasso's.Decided to try this new sushi restaurant for lunch today.  So happy I did!  The good was delicious.  The service was excellent!  Highly recommended.Outstanding all the way around!  Staff was friendly and helpful, service was quick and efficient, food was fresh and tasted awesome.  I had the kale salad, mac n cheese and breakfast bagel sandwich. Recommend them all. I look forward to coming back.Quick service, fun workers, and the wings... So good!! I had yet to find a good wing place here in Phoenix, and who knew I had to come to Glendale! Living so close to this place is going to be bad for my wallet, but amazing for my stomach. We will definitely come back here.Service and food deserves 5 stars!  Parents approved.

Our server Dolly was a doll! She brought us out 2 extra banana nut muffins on the house for no reason. We must have been some good lookin' customers!! Just kidding =P

Omelette's are never a bad choice here no matter which one you select of you love eggs. All come with cajun potatoes and your choice of toast or banana but muffin (go with the muffin if you haven't tried it already and thank me later)!

Order from their specials board located in the waiting room! There's a reason they're special :)

We had several different staff members come to ask if everything was okay, not just our server.Last night my husband and I went to D'Agnese's for dinner and this was the first time for us at the new location.  My heart skipped a beat when they brought the bread and tapenade instead of the wonderful dipping sauce with the pepper rings in it that I am used to. But I asked for it and they were quick to bring it. I ordered the crab stuffed salmon with rice as my side and my husband ordered fish (I think it was halibut) served over gnocchi with sun dried tomatoes. His was really good but mine was spectacular. For starters and most importantly in my book, the salmon was cooked to perfection, then topped with crab and mozzarella cheese and fresh mushrooms. What made the flavors all come together was that by the mushrooms they had some of the marsala sauce (I think) and on the other side of the plate they had their famous lemon butter sauce. Simply the best!El Hefe and I were initially on our way to the fleet of food trucks but then discovered our days were off. Food Trucks are on Wednesdays and today was Tuesday. What a mixer-roo! 

El Portal would have to do, an unfortunate to do at that.

The service is deplorable! The counter expediter was a hot mess. He even addressed me as "Hey You" when my order was ready.  Seriously, what the "Number 2" is up with that?!  The gals that were behind us in line were treated with an even lower grade of service. Now that didn't make me feel special at all.  

I ordered the two (chicken) taco combo and only one taco contained any meat product.  I left hungry.

No bueno: (Too crammed up & smokey. I like the look of the outside in the night time with the lights though. Happy about my favorite slot machine they have there too. I also like the fact that they have two Merry go rounds, because instead of riding horses, your sitting at slot machines, going around & around. LOL

My brother was disappointed that they didn't have much kidie games like a real "Circus Circus" would. I guess he was expecting this circus circus to look like the one in Reno; much better!! Even I think so too...

Glad I came here once, just to check it out. That way, I don't have to come here again to waste my time...The food here is absolutely amazing.   We even got to meet the chef after ordering the food.   Everyone here is really friendly and homemade.  Even the dessert is homemade.   I will come back here again.Came here for happy hour with coworkers. Awesome! The food was delectable and you get some homemade chips while you're waiting. I'm not sure if it's in the bar area only or everywhere, but nonetheless I will definitely be back when I'm in the area.This place has great food and a really nice server. The bread and pasta and all the sauce is homemade plus when you get there brownies it's like half a cake. And it is a great places.An impressive beer selection and purely average bar food round out Fuel and Fuddle's offerings.  Most dining options--from burgers to brunch--cap out at mediocre.  But with a hundred beers to choose from, this place still earns three stars.  If you're not up for drinking, however, you can find much better options.I brought my Mother there today expecting a cheap breakfast. While we were fed copious amounts of food, the bill was outrageous given their $ rating. $7.99 per omelet, no matter which one you choose. Every breakfast item was over $7.00. I was disappointed on price, but not on the quality of the food or the service.  Suggest Brunchies in downtown Chandler instead. Same portions, same service, a bit cheaper.I had a good old fashioned club sandwich and fries. The food was good and the services was good. This small little diner is off the beaten path and is a certainly worth a try. Nothing particularly stood out to me at this eatery, but then again I only ordered a club. The menu is robust and is sure to have something for everyone.Its been awhile since ive been to Verrzanos. Dont know why i waited so long to return. Pizza was excellent like it always has been. The fingers were cooked perfect and the ranch was spot on. The only little complaint i have is the hot sauce had just a lil bit to much vinegar. Other then that everything was greatFlavor is good but was completely surprised when I ordered sausage for my soup and received hotdogs. Especially when it's an extra 5 dollars for the sausage. Come on people!!  Definitely brought me back to my preschool years which is not why I ordered this food. Oil is a main ingredient as well which will make the passage of the food an easy experience. Noodles were a great relief in my dishes as it was the only thing that drew me away from my coloring book and crayons thanks to the hotdogs (I mean Sausage). Not saying I will never try this school house cafeteria again but it will not be a first selection of places to go, maybe a field trip?  I could be 100% wrong on the hot dogs and their desirability in this food but I'm sure I'm not!


I am ordering again to give fairness to the restaurant and the orders.  Will check in after.Really nice board game cafe. It has a wide selection of games for you to choose from and the food taste great. However, I found the food to be a bit pricey and the menu selection was very limited. I would certainly visit again with friends.The first time I came here it was AMAZING! Second time not so much. I was in love with the hummus nachos but the second time I had them they weren't as amazing. Went for happy hour and tried all the appetizers and they were all just OK. Little disappointing because I was so excited about this place after coming here last fall.A friend and I decided to try Thai Basil the other night.  We arrived at what should have been the end of a dinner rush.  The place was empty.  There was one other occupied table when we arrived, but they appeared to be employees eating after their shift.

The place looks nice, but the booths are uncomfortable. The seats feel more shallow than standard sized seats.  The service was acceptable, but not great.  I was unhappy with my dish, and the server did not offer to adjust or change it.

I ordered a masaman  curry, which is usually very mild compared to other curries.  This was not mild at all.  It was so spicy that I could only eat about half a cup.  Masaman curry is supposed to be made with coconut, cinnamon, lemongrass, ginger, cloves and other sweet strong spices.  My dish tasted exactly like a panang curry.  Masaman is coconut based, and panang is peanut based.  They should not taste the same.  The dish was flavorful, but not the right flavors for a masaman curry.

I'm certain that my friend enjoyed the signature dish more than I enjoyed mine.  She also only ate a small amount and took the rest to go.

Dinner with a shared appetizer, beverage and dessert will cost close to $30 while lunch specials will bring the meal price down closer to $15Okay this place is fantastic. I was so impressed and my mouth is watering just thinking about it. I wish I lived in Arizona so I could eat this for every meal. I mean, yeah I totally would do that. 

SO I came in for lunch, it was pretty busy, but the line moved quickly. I ordered a salad, and being the indecisive person that I am, couldn't decided between the chicken and gyro meat. So I got both! And that was probably the best choice I made. 

The workers were so friendly and nice and the service was great. The food came out quick, and holy the servings were HUGE. I was so impressed! Normally places try to skimp you on the amount of protein they give you, but man they loaded it on. And it was all so delicious!! I actually liked both the chicken and gyro a ton. I also was impressed that it was a quality salad. 

Overall, I just think that the prices are reasonable, they give you a good amount of food, and they are super friendly. Delicious Mediterranean!!You must try the 240 day aged ribeye steak. It's def one of the best steaks I've ever had. It has an ultra beefy blue cheese "ness" that's rich and amazing. You have to order by the inch but one inch is a large portion. They serve the steaks tomahawk style on the bone leaving the short rib on and suggest picking up the bone for that cave man indulgence. They carve the beef table side and medium rare on the rare side. The beef cheeks ravioli was crazy bomb too. A must pasta course...The service here is immaculate too. Hats off to Mario Batali and team.This location has very fast service and a quiet environment. Recommended.The best soul food I have ever had!!!! Had the chicken plate with Mac n cheese and green beans!! So delicious!!! The banana pudding cake was amazing!!!! The staff was also really friendly and helpful!! Will be going back time and time again.This place is awesome. Super cheap and solid food. You get much more than you pay for. The highlights for me are the sesame chicken which is always perfectly cooked crispy sweet. The pot stickers are other worldly. I have a dumpling addiction and this place fillls the need. They have a great texture and the meat is perfectly seasoned. The pot sticker sauce is right on and makes everything better. If you want cheap delicious Chinese American  food this is the place in mesa. Be warned that the restaurant is a whole in the wall but they deliver in a pretty wide radius.We have gone to the Alma School location and were pretty underwhelmed. Tried this location out on Saturday and were very pleased.

GO EARLY. We got there at 5 and they were very busy. By 6:45, they were on a wait. When we had tried the Alma School location, it was an hour wait. This place gets slammed.

Started with the raw oysters (super fresh, no grit or fishy taste), a mason mule (refreshing & really well mixed; try it with peach), and beer. They have a good craft selection if that's your thing, running the gamut from milk stouts to Mr. Pineapple. 

We moved onto the piles of seafood. 1 lb snow crab in trifecta level 1, and 1 lb king crab in lemon pepper (FYI, if you just felt like crab with drawn butter, that is the closest you will get). Both were amazing. Don't forget to shove your hand back in the bag and sop the meat up once you crack it out. Also threw some sausage, potatoes & corn on the cob in there. The sausage is pretty spicy and I abandoned it after 2 pieces, but the corn & potatoes are great in the sauces. 

They get a solid 5 stars because of the staff. Our oysters & drinks all came out almost immediately, and our server (Tori) was on top of the beer refills, even bringing tons of limes. 

The cherry on top: fiance ordered a second round of crab, which came out ice cold. Tori felt it with her finger, whisked it back, and within 10 minutes he had a new bag (this one steaming hot). She double checked after the first leg was cracked, and we could tell she actually was interested in making sure it was hot... and then informed us it had been comped. I was shocked (in a good way) that they were that willing to comp a $28 order of king crab just like that AND give us a whole new bag. Usually it's one thing or the other, but dang! They must really want happy guests.So sad... I really miss the PF Chang's from years ago...  Shoulda seen it coming though after what the same private equity firm did to another chain favorite:  Rock Bottom Brewery.

The food is still serviceable, but it's nothing to write home about anymore.  Prices have gone steadily up while portions have gone from overly generous early on to reasonable to downright cheap & skimpy while quality has become inconsistent.   

I was there picking up a take out order this past week, and the disgruntled look of the servers just standing around by the bar commiserating on a slow night tells you everything you need to know.  It's just kind of a depressing environment.  Something is clearly broken here.

Props to the server working take out, though.  He was unusually pleasant and crazy fast\/efficient. 

It's been a slow downhill for a while now, but I think I'm finally done with Chang's now :-(

Locally, you'd do much better with one of the Flo's restaurants or sadly ordering one of the asian-fusion dishes off the Cheesecake Factory menu next door in Kierland.  Ironically, Pei Wei is actually just as good now (though it's quick casual) and a vastly superior value.pricey----worth it

Yes, rumors were true. 

Variety of selections!

excellent presentations...loved the mini baskets for the fried foods---yes i wanted to take it but didn't lol

Quality was good..not like other buffets

location of the restaurant in Cosmo was a JOURNEY! 

Definitely worth a trip back

My favorite was the braised short-rib. Yum!This is not your ordinary buffet. Everything is so delicious. And the best part is that they switch up the food even in the two hours I was there. It went from lobster bisque to crab cakes. I went for brunch and also had the bottomless mimosa. Only thing is you gotta keep bugging for a refill. It's definitely money well spent. Next time I will try dinner.Great pulled pork, bbq sauce so good you could drink it!  Totally going back here!Un vrai coup de cœur pour ce restaurant ! Je l'ai découvert lors d'une soirée de départ d'une amie, qui avait invité une trentaine de personnes. Le lieu s'y prête parfaitement, il y a aussi bien des tables pour 2 ou 4 personnes, que de grandes tablées pour 10 convives.

La nourriture est incroyable ! Plutôt que de choisir entre les différents plats du jour, on a eu la chance de goûter au dhal de lentilles, à la salade de betteraves et chèvre, au poulet mais aussi au saumon, ainsi qu'aux lentilles et légumes rôtis. Tous les plats étaient délicieux, à ne pas en laisser une miette dans l'assiette :)
Un superbe menu pour la bonne cause, que demander de plus ?!

Il faut aussi souligner que les bénévoles qui s'occupent de vous sont très gentils et aux petits soins.Excellent food!! I had the salmon and it was perfect.  I can tell why Bobby Flay is famous. I will be back for more on my next trip to Vegas.Visited Rooster's for a work dinner. Food was ordered as a main dish\/meat and then sides to split between the table. Downstairs area is bar seating only and upstairs is the dining room which had a totally different feel than downstairs. I had the scallops, which were great. The corn and beet sides were quite tasty as well. Great quality food, but not huge portions for the price.We tried to eat here last night. My husband has a milk and cheese allergy so we thought a meat based restaurant would be fine. 

Umm, no it wasn't. 

After sitting down we explained to the server his allergy. There were very few sides he could eat, no bread he could eat and no substitutions that could be made. 

We left. It just didn't seem worth paying for a meal he couldn't eat more than 1\/2 of. 

Ironically we left and went to Roma, an Italian restaurant (land of milk & cheese),  in the same shopping center. They gave him plenty of options and brought him bread he could eat.I concur with the other reviewers and would give this place a 0 if I could.  Food was small in portions and not filling at all for the price you pay.  

I didn't ask for their naan bread but they said that they will give it to me.  Being that it was 10 min before closing I thought it was free.  They then charged me for it hoping I wouldn't notice.   Not the type of business I want to support.I will always be loyal to the pork salad w\/ house dressing, shredded lettuce, black beans. There is truly no reason to order anything else, as this is one of the best meals you could possibly hope for. The line speaks for itself. Again, no words can explain the phenomenon that is this salad, I rest my case. :PSince sometimes Monta ramen is busy, this is my go to place...love the fact that I can get a half miso ramen and half beef curry...both taste greatI've been here 2 times now and really haven't been impressed with this place at all. I tried really hard to like it since it's my friend's favorite restaurant, but just haven't enjoyed any of the food. I tried a fish dish here the first time (wish I could remember exactly what it was) and the most recent trip I had the BBQ pulled pork sandwich which was decent but definitely not impressive. If it were up to me I wouldn't choose to go back, but my friends love it.

Why they love it - a couple reasons, it does have a good vegan\/vegetarian menu (clearly I don't fall in that category based on my menu choices above) but they said its really good for vegans\/vegetarians. Also, they have the outside patio which is nice for dogs!

Overall it's a good atmosphere, but I just don't like the food.Had take out twisted noodles with ahi tuna, clam chowder and the fish tacos.  Everything tasted fantastic.  The noodles were dressed with a light and creamy sesame sauce, and the tuna was cooked to rare perfectly with a crispy crust of sesames.  It was (high-pitched) SO good. Reasonable prices, too. Unfortunately the tacos weren't warm by the time I got to them, but they had a thin, creamy sauce, with a little kick to it.  Overall, a really decent meal.Once again, I give it another chance, this time take out. Pizza may have been the worst I've ever had here or anywhere. Ordered extra wing sauce which I paid for and it was not included. Ordered Bleu cheese dressing and got Ranch. No attention to detail, and food even more sub-par than than I remember.I had 2 slices plain cheese pizza. Very good. Not the best I've had but very good. Slices are huge as is the whole pie. Just guessing 20-22"
Crust was crisp on bottom (as it should be) and even though the slices are large it did not sag. Sauce had a nice flavor and the cheese had just the right amount of sheen. Meaning not that orange greasy stuff flowing from some pizza I've eaten.
The garlic knots looked good but with the size of the slices I dared not try them. At least for now.
If I am in Las Vegas again I will stop by to try some of their other offerings.
Note:White pizza looked phenomenal. Posting a few photosBeing that this is the only fast food that is easily accessible between Uptown and Sardis Road, I have to stop here frequently to get my daughter something to eat before dance practice.  We always go through the drive-through.  Service is always excellent and the wait time is minimal.  I can't complain when her stomach is growling (which it does frequently) as Arby's fits the bill.Small Thai place in Lakewood, Ohio off Detroit....Ordered the Chicken Satay for the table...The Satay was extremely tasty but for almost 7 dollars was a very small portion....It was served in 4 pieces on the 4 different skewers.....The pieces were only about 2.5 inches long per skewer....super thin..For this reason I was somewhat disappointed...I have ordered Chicken Satay in many different places and this was by far the smallest portion I have ever received for the table. I also ordered the Hot & Sour soup by the cup...It was tasty but not as spicy as hot and sour soup usually is...It had more of a sweet taste than a spicy hot taste.....For my main entree I ordered the Orange Chicken and this was served just right! The orange sauce was not overbearing and the consistency was not overly thick. It was a very tasty and hearty portion. I would definitely give them another change. The restaurant was clean, the staff and wait service was friendly and prompt and for the most part the portion matched the price except for the chicken satay.Zero stars. We came here for dinner last Thursday. There were four of us and there was no wait. The waitress tried to seat us at a table with only three chairs, without finding us a fourth chair. I guess one person was supposed to sit on the floor. Then we asked to move to another table, and instead of saying that was ok, she responded that would be a different server. I am not sure why we cared, except our service turned out to be terrible.  Maybe she was trying to save us from that, but I highly doubt she was thinking of us. It took us forever to get our food, and the server was not friendly at all. I ordered a grilled cheese with tomato soup. The "soup" came in a container the size of a side salad dressing. I was expecting an actual bowl of soup. The sandwich and salad dressing\/soup were cold. I'm not sure if we were being punished for moving tables, or if it was always that bad. There are way better places to eat in Pittsburgh. Don't waste your hard earned money here.  This place is living off a name only. It's a tourist trap.  Bad food, even worse service.Everything looks exotic to me at Arz Bakery Ltd. 

Don't be fool by the name "Bakery", it is really a Supermarket that sells everything!! So if you want to cook up a Lebanese-Middle Eastern meals.. this is the to go to place to get all your supplies!

Arz Bakery Ltd as a Bakery really shine with proud display of honey infused goods and desserts... just looking at them give me Sugar High! 

There is also a coffee bar set up with Hor'devours at the back of the store. A lot of older looking gentlemen hanging out there drinking arabic coffee! 

Parking is an issue here in the small, tight parking lot!Sandwiches, sandwiches and (yes!) more sandwiches.  Being open 24 hours is a plus, but having staff that don't stay happy 24\/7 knocks it off it's perfect 5 star perch.Dropped by here for lunch after church. We had barbecue chicken and garlic chicken which are so tasty.  B and her sister who co owns the place gave us free fried chicken and appetizer. This place is awesome.Loved it. The pub chips with onion dip was fantastic as was the cheese dip with pretzel bread. My wife and I split the fish and chips and it was still more food than we could finish. Oh and the fish was battered crispy and melt in your mouth inside. Our server, Ali, was pleasant and knowledgable. He checked often and the service was fantastic all around.I enjoyed my time at Rock Bottom. I had the fish and chips. My husband ordered stuffed peppers, and my friend had a chicken and avocado sandwich. All of us were pleased with our food. My husband was especially pleased with his stuffed poblanos.

All three of us ordered beer flights. I liked everything except for the IPA, which is normal for me (I'm not a big fan of IPAs). My favorite was the Black Velvet Lager. 

Our server was on point. I was never left waiting for water refills, and he was friendly and efficient. Overall a very pleasant dining experience.Nice atmosphere foods was just ok. I'm from Detroit and I'm use to lots of flavor when I have Middle Eastern dishes. Also ask for a refill of the tea I paid $1.50 for it was additional $1.50  that didn't seat well with me either.This is my favorite sub chain. Way better than Jimmy Johns. My wife's fave is the Hook and Ladder light and mine is the meatball which is AMAZING!Two words here...Bourbon & Bartender!! Orphan barrel bourbons available here & "R" is the sweetest. She recognizes and greets everyone, polite and prompt and informative...I could go on and on.

Only sampled a few menu items...they are very good, some carry a heavier price tag.This place is good, especially if you are looking for gluten-free options because they offer gluten free buns.  Prices were extremely inexpensive.  However, my issue was not the food, but the long lines and the lady by the cooker yelling out to people to get their order when they are 10-15 feet away so you don't even know if she is talking to you or someone else.Delicious bagels!!! This is an excellent stop right off the interstate! Friendly and inviting staff! Highly recommend!This place is great. It's run by the sweetest and polite Korean couple.... I was in the neighborhood and starving. Went on yelp and read the reviews and decided to try it. The restaurant it's really small, plain and only a couple of tables. I was greeted by a cute little old Korean lady... She was so polite and immediately got us our menu and thank me and my friend for coming. She took our order without writing it down and got it right. She even told us not to order too much food because it would be to much for us to finish. While she cooked the meals her husband washed the dishes and would checked up on us and kept saying how his wife was the best cook ever and he was completely right.. Really great home tasting food. Will definitely be coming back even it it's not near my neighborhood.Sushi is delicious and not unreasonably priced. I wouldn't say its the best sushi I've ever had but its definitely quality and the prices, atmosphere and selection definitely mske up for it. The entire restaurant has a sense of humor and the staff is generally pretty friendly. 

North central Phoenix also lacks some good bars but Moto's definitely stands out if you're looking to get some drinks as well. Definitely recommend it.We've always loved the sushi here, but the service has taken a giant leap forward. Super friendly, fast, and fun. Looking forward to more sale bombers in 2017. Great restaurant to have in the community. Squid salad is great, soft shell crab, seven sensations.I went to pizza peel on 9\/8\/16 and had pizza and wings. I like the pizza. I've had their pizza before but they really need to get out of the wing game or step it up. I ordered the bbq. The wings are breaded which is fine but if the wings are going to be breaded and then sauced please let the wings have flavor!!! Please let the sauce have flavor!! Please make your wings well done and crispy. No one who orders wings wants tough wings! Charlotte has a few really great wing spots. Take note and do your pings better and get more customers. If you want wings go somewhere else. If you want pizza go here. The pizza is ok.Little bit too expensive but good quality fish. Blue fin tuna sashimi is the best. Cod skewers are my favorite. Rolls are ok. They use real crab meat which is great but it's too strong. Love the ambience. Cocktails are ok but couldn't find in the menu something exciting for me. Service is great and fast! Definitely give another go to try more things from the menu!Great restaurant model here - love being able to go out with a group of people with very diverse eating preferences without anyone feeling like they're sacrificing their options. 

Great food on both sides of the menu. Good service, great drinks. 

Fuegos also had a great showing at Margarita Fest 2018 - truly unique in that they were the only restaurant bold enough to make their tortillas FRESH as you were in line. Nothing coming out of a bag there!

Also, Jordan was hooked us up with a sweet piñata at the end of the Fest - thanks man! His name's Ferdinand - he got lots of attention on the walk back piggy back style up East WashIf I was able to give negative stars I would. Zoe's has been my favorite Greek salad place for the last few years. I have overlooked rude employees, messed up orders, and the other issues just to get the Greek salad I enjoy so much. After tonight, I have gone there for the last time after the last six times in a row the staff was rude and they screwed up my order. 

Don't bother calling ahead for pickup since they will not make you food until you show up anyway. I have tried this many times and it's always the same reaction. 

The staff seems careless and more about talking to each other and not servicing the customers. 

The female cook who brought her kids into the restaurant and was sitting with them mocked me when I asked for no onions after they got my order wrong. She had to make it again and was offensive even though I did nothing wrong. Btw I didn't see her wash her hands after she re-entered the kitchen after sitting in the lobby with her kids. 

Tonight was no different. They were out of cake which is why my wife likes going there, they changed their portions to a smaller take out bowl and forgot the pita bread which normally comes with the salad, luckily they didn't put onions on my salad which they normally do even when I ask for it not to be.

I am done .... don't make the mistake I have made so many times over by going there..My fave Vietnamese place! The fish sauce wings won me over. They are to die for. I find myself craving them often. I also love the grilled chicken bahn Mi with an egg on it. I've never had something I was disappointed in. My husband and I come here often. We always receive amazing customer service.Their food is high standard (prices reflect that). I compared their Soon Dae ($13) to Owl of Minerva (Thursday special, $6.99) and even though it's like double the price, I would go back to Cho Sun Ok and ordered theirs. It's a lot juicer and tastier!!Beautifully presented, succulent fresh sushi and sashimi. I ordered a sushi combination and was unfamiliar with two of the fish. Both were delicious and it was fun to try something new. Personable and enthusiastic staff. Missed a few fine points, like no soy sauce on the table and not bringing a fresh napkin after the original absorbed a spill.

My one complaint is the music. It was so loud and conversation was impossible. They have a DJ and the music is better suited for a dance club than a restaurant. It diminished our experience and dinner was far less pleasant than it should have and could have been. 

The food is outstanding but sadly, the pounding, intrusive music will keep us away.We flew in Thursday evening and checked out Sunday. The rooms are very nice and the hotel atmosphere is fun but the customer service is by far the worst! Front desk staff is so unbelievably rude and not helpful at all. My mom accidentally forgot her room key in the hotel room so she went to the front desk to ask for a replacement. She was told that the person who made the reservation has to call to add her on as an occupant which is understandable. We call and tell the person the situation and they say they can't help and we have to be transferred...we were transferred four times in total because apparently no one at the front desk knew what to do. The person that originally answered the phone was the one that ended up "helping". They refused to add my mom to reservation although they verified that we purchased the rooms via phone number, address and made us walk back to the hotel to let her in to the room (we were at the Venetian at the time celebrating my birthday which was cut short due to this whole debacle). Also, we wanted to purchase tickets to a show so we went to the ticket desk and asked the man for tickets for thunder down under, he gave us a weird look, stopped us and made his coworker stop helping the people she was with to "help" us! It was so unbelievably rude. Anyway, so this lady comes and we ask if they sell tickets for thunder down under and she says yes and shows us a video for another show....so I repeated to her no we want thunder down under that's what we asked you initially and you said yes. She got all flustered and said oh go next door to the ticket box...so we go to where she said and they said no we have to go the front of the hotel to purchase tickets. The whole thing was a mess....don't stay here if you want good customer service. It's a shame that the staff is rude because I would have considered staying again and recommending the hotel to family and friends but there is no way I will now!We go here often for dinner. They always have good service and I love the Teriyaki. My husband is a fan of the sushi and we both enjoy Edamame for an appetizer. The decor is great and I love the atomosphere. We will continue to go here regularly.Wonderful lunch there today. Well worth the drive and will do it again. Great authentic Italian Beef and pastas. Homemade as I remember from my childhood in Grandma's kitchen. Can't wait to try the Breaded Steak Sandwich.  That I hope will be next week. Large portions so enough to share a meal. If no sharing, take the rest home for another meal. Wonderful people and food.first off i called and the guy barley spoke any english then i had ordered a pizza and had decided to cancel so 2 minutes later i called and canceled but they still charged my credit card so i called and ask for a refund and they pretty much told me too bad so beware of this and i would suggest romas pizza very good and family ownedIt has been a few years since we had gone to this place. The wife and I decided to play some Golden Tee. In the past, we would have been neglected and would play one round because there wasnt any service. Last night we had a waitress, Arielle (sp), who was amazing. The place has cleaned up quite a bit and their service is excellent. Needless to say, we will probably start going back more regularly. Thanks everyone.First time going here.  I was very impressed with the food and service.  I wanted to get one thing but the chef suggested something else.  I went with his choice and I was not disappointed at all.  I can not wait to go back.I'm a sports bar regular, particularly during football season, and am not super picky about ambience, but this place needs a serious facelift.

My wife and I visited Baseline twice recently, and while it's a great place to catch a game, it's not going to be a regular stop. The food is quite good for a sports bar, but the look of the place is old and in need of repair.  

Details:  Stick with traditional bar food if you're going to eat here.  I generally go with wings and burgers in this kind of place, and found both to be excellent.  My wife, however, is a more adventurous diner, and tried the Thai chicken wrap which was more soup than solid food, and not much taste, either.  The spicy quesadilla she tried was too spicy for her to get down, though that may be a matter of individual taste.  Prices were average, and the size of the servings is adequate.

Service was friendly and efficient;  servers are very nice and attentive.

The biggest problem is the overall appearance of the bar.  It's poorly lit (not unusual for a sports bar, but this was darker than most bars), which is probably an advantage, because the place looks, well, OLD.  Definitely in need of a makeover, it looks like it hasn't been updated since 1985.  Both bathrooms are well-worn, and while not disgusting, they need a complete upgrade.  The "patio", small and primarily for smokers, has worn out furniture and umbrellas.  

Plenty of TV screens for sports, and we were pleasantly surprised when the server actually knew how to change a channel on the satellite TV.  This seems to be rare in local sports bars.  

Bottom line is the Baseline is toward the bottom of the scale among some much better alternatives in this neighborhood.  A "Bar Rescue"-type makeover is sorely needed.  Otherwise, food's fine and the service is above average. If the ambience were to be improved, this place would probably be packed.  As it is, it's a little above the level of a biker bar.There is a wall of glass panels enclosing a wine rack that sectioned off the entrance and the inside of the restaurant. An intimate wine bar with an acceptable noise level that's great for awkward first dates. The wooden accents provides a rustic feel also.

I have been here on two occasions. My waiter the first time I've been here was quite the eye-candy for the night. It's quite an extensive Italian menu and I settled for the lobster ravioli. Unfortunately it was very salty and I didn't end up finishing it. However the cocktails were more on the creative and tasty end.

I had a much better experience the second time around. I came here later at night so I got a choice in terms of seating. Again the drinks did not disappoint and I highly recommend their Grilled eggplant, zucchini, roasted peppers, dish with balsamic drizzle. Our waitress the second time around was also very diligent and helpful. 

This place would've earned a higher rating if it wasn't for the disappointing lobster ravioli the first time around, but definitely a thumbs up for their great service and creative cocktails.In two visits, we found the same excellent food and service.  A full house, but a reasonably quiet midday visit.Great place! If you are craving freshly cooked, healthy and flavorful cuisine, Hedary's is the place to go. Their Mediterranean cuisine is full of flavor and deliciousness! I especially love their lunch specials--great prices for quality, fresh ingredients and food. Everything that I tried here from Greek and Fatoush salads to gyros, hummus and fish has been great. Very healthy! Take out service is quick and efficient. Bread is freshly baked. Hedary's is definitely becoming one of my favorite restaurants in town!Love this place! Healthy options, great quality and they have never gotten an order wrong through the drive-thru!!I ate at Lakeside Grill for the first time the weekend before Thanksgiving, and the food was nothing short of brilliant.  I ordered the filet mignon, and my wife had the scallops, and both dishes were cooked to perfection.  When we arrived, we informed our waitress that we were seeing the 7 PM show of La Reve (it was our fault for poor planning), but our waitress informed the chef and had our food out with time to spare for our show.  This restaurant has only been open for a few weeks, but the ambiance and setting for this restaurant is definitely memorable.  From our table, we had a beautiful view of the cascading, multi-colorful waterfall wall outside the south side of the restaurant, which is all glass.  I don't spend much time at the Wynn when I'm in Vegas (mostly because I can't afford to), but this was definitely money well-spent, followed by one of the best Cirque De Soleil shows that I've seen in Vegas!  I highly recommend this restaurant with 2 enthusiastic thumbs up!When I think of the new crop of Strip hotels, I think of Mandalay Bay. The gaming area is spacious - or maybe it just seemed that way in these recessionary times. I played some craps and one hand of blackjack before and after dinner at the House of Blues. That's another thing, they have their very own House of Blues, which is a good venue for live music.

Mandalay Bay is a bit more massive than lavish, but seemed to be a pretty good option if you wanted to stay on the Strip.Continuing to enjoy some of The Forest City's beers, I stopped at Market Garden and nabbed a quiet table in the back. Well, it was mostly quiet until the sports on the big screen started to get interesting and the bros started getting deep into their beers. Well, that's part of the show, right?

Terrific selection of local beers here and some macros, but I stuck to the local stuff. Yes, please. Good service from my waitress who was happy to keep me hydrated with beer.

I also got something to eat to go with that beer. Their Turkey Reuben is a winner. Grilled, loaded with sliced turkey and Swiss cheese and Russian dressing (and pickles?), it went down a treat. The fries were decent though not great. A good portion, but a little floppy and not quite as hot as the sandwich. Still, quite good.

Neat spot to get some beers and some grub. Me likey!Visiting from New Jersey and had seen this place on man vs food so decided to check it out... it was amazing! It's a speakeasy! Portions were huge! Our waitress was so friendly! We started with the caprese and the mob meatball salad which were both great, the red marinara was spicy and so good!! For dinner we had the lasagna and chicken parmigiana both were delightful! To end the night we had the cannolis which come 2 in an order and are so creamy! Highly recommend coming here!!!!So over priced for absolutely terrible food, so many better places in the valley for Indian food.We sat close to the wait station and it was very noisy. Our wait person did an amazing job, Disappointed that the food was so hot that you really couldn't taste the flavor of what you were eating. My sister who has eaten there numerous times said that she has never experienced that much spice. I will give it another try. It may just have been the green chile batch that was used for that particular day.Really good bar food ... My go to place when it's late, after 10 and nothing really good is open.  Skip the margaritas .. they're horrible .. stick with beer or straight alcohol :)PIDE is the bomb. It is like a light open face calzone. We tried three of the salads- each was as fresh and delicious as the next. Out of the way, but so worth the drive. Owners are super friendly and had great service. Phenomenal quality of ingredients. Check it out.Someone mentioned that this place doesn't look like much from the outside and boy, are they right. The plaza it is located in looks so old and deserted it made me question for a hot second whether to get out of the car. Luckily, Lao Thai is located in the corner of the building closest to the street and had a big sign advertising their lunch special for $7.95 so we marched on. The inside of the place is the complete opposite of the exterior - it's done up nicely with lots of tables and a spacious feel. There were many other lunchers there but not overly crowded to the point of uncomfortable. 

The variety of lunch specials available was a nice surprise but the hubs and I ordered our typical Thai faves: HIM-pad thai; ME: yellow curry. The food was brought to us fairly quickly, was decent in flavor and good on price. We splurged a bit and treated ourselves to their coconut ice cream for dessert - a great choice for the taste buds but my hips will surely regret it later. 

I noticed some reviews mention spotty service but we didn't experience any of that today. The girls working the cash register, taking our order and serving the food were all super pleasant and sweet. We thought service was pretty darn quick and we were both starving (almost to the point of grumpiness) by the time we arrived so that's saying something. I don't know if it's different at dinnertime or what but the lunch service today was really good. 

Overall, a good lunch spot considering the price so don't let the deserted plaza deter you if you feel like some decent thai food that's friendly on your wallet.Food, service, ambiance... if you add them up, the barrymore comes out to a perfect 5.  

My wedding hairstylist recommended the Barrymore to me.  Her husband is a chef, as is mine.  We were getting married in Vegas and wanted the night after the wedding to be an intimate date, away from the 100 loved ones who flew out to celebrate our nuptials....  so the barrymore it was!

Initially, it was going to be just my fussy chef of a groom and me... alas, one of his chef friends and his girlfriend were still in town, and looked longfully at us as we described our plans of eating things I don't normally eat... so a party of five it was.

The place is amazing.  I don't understand why people have negative things to say about the Royal Resort.  Sure, it's not the Four Seasons or the Wynn, but it's the height of re-done art deco miami coziness.  I loved the lobby, the lighting and the mirrors strung artfully on the wall.  What a great space!  I would totally stay there.

The restaurant is as folks described - classy, sexy, a beautiful version of what we dream old Vegas was.

Our waiter was nice and helpful.  We ordered cocktails.  We all enjoyed them.  And then.... the food!  We ordered so much... Octopus (the first time I enjoyed octopus!) was tender not chewy, perfectly seasoned... yum.  Watermelon and heirloom tomato salad was a hit - we loved the candied rind.  Veal sweetbreads?  I will ignore what they are and savor each delicious bite.  The pastry with the foie gras was a bit sweet for me, but as a combination, it was amazing!  the vegetarian pasta dish was delicate and understated.  The clams were a bit chewy, but the pepper sauce was great.  The vegetable cous cous dish was probably the only dish that we didn't like too much - it was a bit boring.  While everything else was special and unique, this was ordinary.  Next up were the two entrees that we shared.... were we still hungry?  Not at all.  Does that stop chefs from tasting everything?  Not at all.  We shared the duck two ways and the short rib.  The duck was good, the short rib was EXCELLENT.  Perhaps the best I've ever eaten.  I want another one!

We were too full for dessert, but our fabulous waiter brought us a celebratory creme brulee.  Tasty.

While we like to try different restaurants when in Vegas, we have found one that we'll be back to again and again.What can I say?  Cozumel has it going on!  From taste to service, Cozumel has it all.  Even on the busiest nights (Friday & Saturday), Cozumel delivers excellent food and service at a low price.  You won't miss the game either because they have several TVs for your viewing pleasure.

This is the best Mexican food I've had in Cleveland and I've eaten at almost all the Mexican restaurants around here, including Nuevo Acapulco, Momocho, Don Ramon, and others.  I've eaten at the Broadview Rd. Cozumel, the Brunswick Cozumel and the Brookpark Cozumel, but the Broadview Rd. location is by far the best in service and ambiance.

My favorite dish is the Fajitas Cozumel along with a grande frozen margarita.  Their frozen margarita grande is huge and is the best margarita I've ever had.  They have kids' dishes as well.

Consistently, the food arrives within 10 minutes.  I have a running joke: after I place my order, I time them to see how long it takes to bring the food out.  Sometimes, the food arrives in four to five minutes!  The nachos and salsa are great, but I recommend the melted cheese that you can order on the side for the nachos, yum!

The servers are all but sprinting to get your food and drinks delivered quickly.  The average time between ordering food and receiving food is about seven minutes.  The food and service are always consistent as I've eaten here about 30 times over eight years.  I like the speedy service, but it may not be for everyone.

I've been trying other menu items like Huevos Rancheros and Pollo Con Crema and they were just okay, and very good, respectively.

http:\/\/cozumelrestaurante.com\/This take-out place (with limited outdoor seating in warm weather) is good for what it is -- a quick take-out Shawarma and Falafal place for under 10 bucks that serves fast and fresh food. 

We usually get the falafel sandwich -- the falafels are freshly made (I've been to places that pre-fry them and let them sit around!!), the salads are decent. I hear the chicken shawarma is good from my brother-in-law, but not had it myself (we are vegetarians). Even my 2 year old likes the food!

While the staff is not the friendliest (just efficient), Habeebe's has location going for it. It is across the way from the harbourfront, so, even though there is no formal seating, just cross the street and enjoy your food by the lake.Best burgers in Mississauga .. Philly steak sandwich simply amazing. Amazing variety of toppings .. place too small is the only drawback, otherwise they know their burgers very well.Closed. Been here 100's of times but they do have a severe management issue. Such a prime location, such prime premises, so sad it's managed to the bottom. 

Tried going there today as it's on our way to the marina we keep our boat, but again closed down. 

Somebody really need to get this place up and running, boaters from the whole region is ready to go there once it's managed properly.Had the pho n pad Thai, both wasn't too good the pho broth was white looking but I guess it was fast foodTucky's was some of the best BBQ I have ever had! The smell from the smoker hits you before you even hit the door. The brisket was juicy and flavorful. The burnt ends and rib tips are perfection. Everything just melted. As for the sides, it is all personal preference. The coleslaw was vingager based. My husband loved that. The beans were sweet, which I like. Potato salad is red potatoes and it was good. The service was great. Since it was our first time they helped us make selections and told us their personal favorites. 
We have not been able to stop talking about Tucky's. We have told everyone how great our experience was. We will definitely be back!My favorite Mexican restaurant in the Lorain County and vicinity area. I have gone for a girls' night out and a family outing. Either way the chips and cheese are great and my quesadilla is always delicious. Try the strawberry margaritas and daiquiris. They are yummy!I was in Vegas for a bachelorette party and we decided to do a nice dinner here before heading out on the town.  loved the ambiance and the staff were so incredibly nice. our table of six girls made up about 90% of the female clientele in the restaurant since many of the other tables looked like they were full of business men and guys out for their bachelor party. since we were planning on a long night out we didn't want to cut it short by eating ourselves into a food stupor. the staff were so nice and accommodating about us sharing our food since they said they usually serve family style.  Here's the food breakdown:

Oysters on the half shell: fresh, crisp, tasted like they were straight from the ocean.  No complaints there.

Frisee Salad: Basic salad. good nothing amazing, but I enjoyed it. 

Porterhouse (shared 3 ways): Meat was definitely high quality and delicious! I like my meat cooked rare, but since I was sharing with 2 other people we went medium rare so the meat was a bit more done than I care for.  The meat was still flavorful and super juicy. We actually didn't even finish the porterhouse even among 3 girls with very healthy appetites!

Sides: We ordered asparagus, yukon gold puree, and hen of the woods mushrooms.  At a steakhouse I'm really all about the meat so quality of the sides are important, but not my main focus. I enjoyed the asparagus and the yukon gold puree.  I usually enjoy any and all foods, but I have to admit the hen of the woods mushrooms were new to me and definitely had a taste that I found peculiar and just didn't work for me, but everyone else seemed to enjoy them. 

Dessert:  Table of 7 girls shared a chocolate souffle. IT WAS AMAZING.  Enough said... I'm not that big on chocolate but that souffle made me feel some feelings. ;)  

Overall, food was consistently good and the offerings were fairly basic steakhouse fare. Staff was wonderfully attentive and nice. I would have appreciated a better $50-$75\/bottle selection of wines.  I know it's a finer dining experience, but after dropping all that money on food a decent affordable bottle of wine would have made it that much better. :)I thought I would never find a slightly upscale restaurant that delivers great Cajun flavors other than the super-casual Battiste & Dupree.  Well, ta-da, insert Russo's.  The Jambalaya was so freaking good.  Nice heat, lots of flavor.  The side salads with dinner, although served on a chilled plate, weren't that great. They are missing something.  The hubby ordered the filet which seriously was tender and quite arguably the best value on the menu at $17.99 when ravioli is $22.99.  Roasted garlic was on point and the broccoli appetizer was great. Nice wine selection. Service was attentive but definitely felt rushed at times. The open kitchen makes you appreciate the blood, sweat and tears that go into making awesome food.  Definitely make a reservation because you will need it.  Great dinner experience.  Now...time to polish off my Jambalaya leftovers!Don't bother.

$6.49 for 5 wings, and terrible service.

I waited at the register for 10 minutes......and was ignored the entire time.  So I went somewhere else.My wife and I visited this establishment prior to a concert at Chandler Center for the Arts because it was within walking distance.  It was just a bonus that it was happy hour and we got to sample more of their cocktails. The mixologist happens to have a flair for taking classic cocktails and infusing new and exciting flavors.  For instance, the "Delicious Sour" is their take on the classic Whiskey Sour.  This drink is far less "sour" and more complex than the standard classic and adds hints of cinnamon and meringue.  It is fantastic!  My wife had something that was named something similar to "Pineapple Pimm's Cup".  I'm leery of drinks based on pineapple juice, as they tend to be too sweet.  This drink was sweet, but not over the top.  The sweetness only lured you in to the honey and lemon flavors waiting just below the surface.
We had another round of different drinks with more unexpected and delightful flavors, but I'll leave it to you to explore the "Custom" cocktails...
I want to touch on the happy hour food, which was on par with the spectacular drinks!  No really... the "Mushroom Swiss Bricks" are similar to sliders, but are real, honest to goodness, beef patties with amazing sauteed mushrooms and Swiss cheese.  They even threw in some shoestring French fries!  In short, yum!  We also tried the "Loaded Fingerlings".  Let's just say that we will absolutely be back for more of those...  We were almost done when the couple next to us ordered fish tacos.  The smell was like heaven and they were presented so beautifully that we had to order them to see if it was a fluke!  Our attentive waitress brought them to the table and - WOW!  You will not believe the flavor this place packs into those little tortillas!  I mean, who puts Bok Choy on fish tacos?  Well, let me tell you, it's these guys!
What a great experience.  This place is super cool with the industrial vibe the decor presents.  The staff is accommodating and eager to give suggestions based on your preferences.  And, as an aside, the bartender is extremely entertaining and engaging.  You can tell that he loves his job and takes pride in every drink he makes.  You've got to try this place for yourself.  You will not be disappointed.If you've read more than a handful of Yelp reviews, you've probably run across at least one review that starts out with " I really wanted to like this place more".  Fear not gentle reader, this is not one of those reviews.  In fact, it's just the opposite.  I like this place more than I feel I should.  Despite being housed in a west side strip mall, despite no information on the sourcing of their ingredients, despite the bizarre fusion of wine bar and sports bar elements, I keep coming back.  Why, you ask?  They offer creative food with exceptional service in an intimate setting  Every time I've visited, my wife and I have left content.  And there are very few places in Madison that I can say that about.

Things I like:
 * Want to feel like a rock star? The attentive service at Eno Vino will make you feel like one.  The entire staff really seems focused on creating the best possible experience for the patrons.  More than anything else, this is keeps drawing me back.

 * I adore the humble simplicity of the Charred Hot House Tomato Soup.  It may be the lowest priced item on the menu, but this dish never fails to amaze.  Intense tomato flavor that is perfectly complimented by a mini grilled cheese sandwich.  Highly recommended!
 
* A wine list that's twelve freakin' pages long.  It has a great mix of varietals and regions.  If you feel overwhelmed by all the choices, the servers and bartenders have offered some great recommendations.  I also recommend utilizing the wine flights as a way to sample some out of the ordinary.

 *  I appreciate the wide variety of menu choices.  Usually I get nervous when I see a wide variety of cuisines represented on the menu.  But kitchen at Eno Vno does a pretty decent job of representing the various cuisines of Asia, Europe and the Americas. When I have a disappointing dish, it's more the result of poor execution than of poor concept.  

 * Overall, I enjoy the ambiance.  Once I enter, I immediately forget that I'm in a strip mall.  Romantic lighting levels, the fireplace by the bar, the warm color palette of the decor make it a great date night location.  While others have complained about the noise level, I've never experienced that problem when seated at the the chef's table or the bar area. 


Things I don't like:
 * Black hole, meet wallet.  A couple glasses of wine, several appetizers and a dessert will likely set you back $100.  Eno Vino adheres to a quality over quantity philosophy, which you'll noticed when it comes time to pay the bill.

 * For a restaurant that focuses on food quality, I'm surprised they don't indicate where they are sourcing their ingredients.  They may adhere to a farm-to-table philosophy like many of the other finer, local dining establishments, but the menu or the website does not shed any insights.  When I go to Graze, I know exactly where the items on the cheese board came from, not so at Eno Vino.

 * For the love of god, ditch the TVs in the bar area.  Do you really think showing SportsCenter adds to the ambiance?  I didn't think so.

 * I'm surprised there haven't been more road rage incidents in the parking lot as the strip mall patrons race each other to find an open parking spot.  Be prepared to spend time hunting for a parking spot.

Despite these imperfections, I still am a huge fan of Eno Vino.Recently tried this restaurant for lunch.  The Lamb Korma was spot on with just the right amount of spiciness!  YUM!  Repeat customer here!!The salsa and food was amazing. It was very flavorful. It's one of the few restaurants that i've gone to several times (moved to Phoenix recently). I grew up with my parents cooking amazing food, so it's nice to find a place that has chicken that is juicy and has flavor. Many places have big pieces of chicken in their burritos that are just dry. 
Highly recommend this restaurant.One of the best breakfasts I've ever had! Get the Hog and Chick and the chocolate milk. The thick cut bacon is awesome... My only negative is the wait is about 20 minutes at 9:00 and gets longer as the morning goes.What an experience... 
The service was truly awful. I will not lie, they did try their best to be accommodating, but failed miserably. I waited over half an hour for my salmon soba, where there were four employees in total who could not get to it. The whole waiting time consisted of each employee mentioning the words salmon soba on average of 4x PER PERSON. It was interesting to see how other people who came in after myself, retrieved their orders quickly. I also ordered the scallion pancake which came out in a timely manner. I enjoyed eating this while waiting for my entree to come out. After my salmon soba arrived, one of the cooks asked if I wanted sauce for my scallion pancake which I was already finishing up. He apologized, but at that point and time there was nothing that could be done. I have no idea as to why it took so long for my bubble tea to be made, another employee waited until the last minute to make me one which only took her two minutes to make. I had the strawberry bubble tea, which I did not enjoy (but I am particular about my bubble tea). 
Other notes: seating is rough as they're are two long tables available with one small circle table by the restroom, so for those not comfortable with sitting next to a stranger, maybe this place is not for you. Water is self-serving and available (no ice, just water). They also ran out of chopsticks.. 
I would only come back for the scallion pancake, I did really enjoy that.Very much enjoyed the burrito with beans and rice. It was comparble to something like Qdoba although with less variety on the menu but similar quality. The salsa was great as was the guacamole, next time I will try it with sour cream. The only thing I would say is for the salad get some darker greens rather than the iceberg. Seating is pretty limited, outside on a nice day - you better grab your table quick!The day had come where I could finally sit out and enjoy Charbar's patio! 

Who wouldn't love a day sitting in the sun, enjoying some eats and dope beats? 
(Well, some fuddy duddies didn't like Ludacris blasting on the speakers and asked to turn down the music because it was "too loud" *eye roll*)

Nevertheless, we had a great lunch and I found a new fave place for guac! I have no idea what seasoning they had on their chips but it made them super addicting, we couldn't get enough!

Our pizza and burger were ok, nothing spectacular. So if you're looking to go for appies (GET THE GUAC) and drinks this summer, hit up Charbar's patio!Terrible, slow service in a nearly empty restaurant-nonevent night. I cannot imagine how they handle any kind of crowd here. 

Servers lack all attention to detail, and seem to have the attitude of "why get it right the first or second time when you can apologize after you screw up?" Manager apologized, too but still charged me full price.Hands down. this is the place to go. 

My drunk group of friends and I ventured down to Fremont to come here, since there was no coverage and it was free rollerblading on a Wednesday night. How can you turn down that offer? Seriously. 

When you walk in theres a big dance floor, gaming section, bar, couches, and good vibes. When you walk out to the back, MORE games, like jenga, teeter ball, gigantic beer pong and a freaking roller blading rink! did I say LIT?! If not let me say it one more time. LIT. I guarantee you'll have a great time at this place as my friends and me did. It was awesome watching each other bust our asses on the rink. The music was very chill as well and created a dancing environment. So drunk roller blading + good music = a great Wednesday night for us. 

I highly recommend coming to this place if you are visiting Downtown Las Vegas. It'll be an awesome experience for you and your friends.Total disappointment. A few weeks ago I went here with my cousin thought the service and food were great. Tonight I went for Cinco de Mayo at 8:30 it was packed like a mad house and my husband and I wanted to sit outside. We were willing to wait and understood that they were busy. My husband and I sat at the bar to wait. It took 15 minutes before someone finally served us. My husband asked for the tab and it took another 15 minutes before they tabbed us out because we were being seated. We waited almost 40 minutes to be seated, again busy, so we understood. What I am most upset about is how after we got seated 5 minutes went by, 10 minutes went by, 15 minutes go by no one had come up to our table to provide chips or asked us if we had been helped. To offer points we had plenty of servers look at us and walk by. I mean I could have said excuse me to one of them, but it shouldn't be the customers job to ask for service at a restaurant. Super disappointed, so we left without any service or food.What can I say that has not already been said!  This will be my buffet of choice from now on!  Good small portions but the food is by far the best buffet, hey small portions just means you can try different food!  Went for breakfast but I need to go back one day for dinner!  I might not leave!I find the the art of making sushi rolls is lost of the chefs that work here.  The first example is the how overcooked the rice is.  It's like going to an Italian place and it not being al dente.  It's inexcusable.  Maybe management should at least get one good Japanese sushis chefs to run the Mexican worker line of sushi chefs, because it seems they can make what looks like sushi but can't deliver on the essential elements that separates sushi from just being rice, fish and seaweed. 

Their all you could eat deal would be fantastic if you felt like eating the sushi.  Yuck! 

Many of the reviewers must be from Las Vegas and have no idea what fresh fish or good sushi is supposed to be. Fail! 

Everyone was nice and friendly or i would have rated this place a 1 star.It's good food. Service is slow, friendly, people, nice amphisphere. Good taco Salad they really feed you well. Nachos are constitent refill nachosGreat food! But I would love to enjoy that food without the waitress in the corner doing nothing but "trying to pickup a rich guy to support her daughter" that's all I'm listening to right now. Its like a live soap opera, interesting but ANNOYING. She's working at the wrong restaurant. Our waitress was  nice and food was good.This bakery had a lot of different choices - pastries, muffins, cakes, bars, sandwiches, donuts, coffee, tea, etc. all at reasonable prices. We got the almond croissant, Portuguese sausage bread, and two custard tarts and our total came out to around $7.50
The almond croissant was very soft, and the inside was a sort of egg custard filling. The worker said this was one of the most popular sellers.
The Portuguese sausage bread had two layers of thinly sliced sausages inside, but was a lot more bready than it was meaty. The custard tarts were our favorite - they were pretty small, but packed with so much custard, and the shell was very flaky and buttery.The hostesses are rude. 

The food is absolutely fantastic. Taste and presentation are on point. 

The cocktail and wine selection are great. Order the cocktail sorbet, can't remember the name, but the presentation is wonderful. 

The atmosphere is eccentric. 

Service is ok. You always have that feeling that they are judging you for not spending more, even tho our bill was $600.....

I watched the waiter roll his eyes when he showed another server the bottle of wine we ordered--even tho we ordered two. 

Considering the crappy renovation of the SLS I can't imagine they get too many million dollar players to have this kind of attitude.Wednesday evening 02\/05\/14, stopped for dinner after golf and very disappointed. Sat in the bar area for over 15 minutes, 2 bartenders, numerous waitresses walked by and not one person acknowledged we were there. Got up and left. Will not be back. Very poor customer service!Service was good and food was awesome. I got the steak Tacos with rice and beans.  The tacos were great and it was a 
lot of food. I would recommend it if your in the area.The Andrew person below is insanely out of his mind, Jamie is the worse and extremely rude. Maybe it helps if you're a dude and she can send you a Facebook friend request and try to holla. This place recently switched ownership to 'One Coffee Co' a do am hoping for significant changes, or I still won't be returning, and I know this holds the same for the majority of the people in my office that are also done with 'the deli'To make this short, great interior, wait time to be served was awful, waitress knew her menu.  We got our appetizer with the complementary bread and cheese.  Great? Not really.   I order the main filet mignon mid rare ($45) and the , she ordered the certified Angus beef.   Filet mignon was bland, not enough seasoning, small.  Potatoe was way too hot and mushy inside.  The Angus beef had way more flavor and it had some type of crunchy tortilla underneath.  In total the price for the food does not overcome the taste.  I wouldn't recommended it to anyone. Way too expensive for the mediocre service and food.Decently priced and taste for Mexican fast food. Its not everyone's favorite but their are very few 24 hr restaurants open. This is one of them. Tacos are larger then most which explain why they are over 2 bucks. They also do a TACO Wednesday which I find weird. In California its Taco Tuesday for specials. I do love there Taquitos tho.We came here for the Super Bowl: did some research before hand and decided $100 a person for open bar and a guaranteed seat was a good deal. Spoke to many staff members before hand, including a manager, and determined you didn't need to purchase this package to sit and watch the game. We made a reservation (again, $100 a person) for three of us to get a wristband. Close to halfway through the game, my mom, who wasn't planning on ordering more than one drink, came to sit with us and hang out (again, we had confirmed this was ok). The waitress came by, and my mom asked to order a drink, but she said you must spend $75 if you didn't have a "reservation". Fine, no problem, she'll just sit and hang out. Then about 5 minutes after that, our waitress came back with her manager and told my mom she needed to leave because she wasn't going to spend the $75. No warning, no nothing, had clearly just gone and told on us to her manager. It was never communicated to us that spending this $75 was mandatory, more so just seemed like something that needed to be done if you were going to order something without having purchasing a wristband. *Not to mention, there were tons of open tables in this place, and the three of us with wristbands were sitting at a 4 person table, so her sitting with us was not losing this place any money* When we asked a manger about it, they kept saying "the company makes us do it" ( the company mind you, was not present and would have no idea she was sitting with us). Overall, there was just horrible communication and no common sense amongst the staff, and for people paying $300+, we should've been treated better. Basically, we should've had the 4 of us just show up and meet the $75 minimum per person, instead of having 3 of us paying $100. It would've come out to the same total price, and we could've all sat together instead of having my mom rudely kicked out. I get that it's Vegas and they want to make money, but this option was never suggested to us. They weren't willing to work with us at all, and honestly made our Super Bowl more unpleasant than it needed to be. Not to mention their TVs went out in the middle of the game so we couldn't even watch the whole thing. And they turned the sound off during the halftime show to conduct a raffle, so we missed a large portion of that as well. I'm typically not a complainer, and to be honest the food and drinks were good, I just feel like all of these issues could've been completely avoided.I went here after an event last weekend. The service was friendly and the food was plentiful. I gave it three stars, because there's nothing exciting to rave. I'll go back again the next time I am in Town Square, since it's consistently delivers.La bouffe est bonne, mais ce n'est pas suffisant pour sauver la mise (de toute façon, la bouffe est bonne dans la plupart des buffets indiens). Le restaurant se trouve dans un sous-sol, ce qui fait que l'atmosphère, en partant, n'est pas ce qu'il y a de mieux. Le personnel a l'air aussi heureux qu'un groupe de prisonniers à vie à Guantanamo. Pas souriants, peu engageants, brusques, incapables de parler français, même presque agressifs, à la limite, quand on essaie de se faire servir dans cette langue, bref, les employés d'Allo Inde semblent être autant à l'aise avec le public qu'un obèse dans un wagon de métro de Tokyo. Un pêu dommage.Friendly Staff, good food, quick service and decent prices.  

I recommend, 
Pizzas, Buffalo and regular chicken Ceasar salad.  Italian Sodas!unbelievable food and good prices! I was pleasantly surprised at the food here at Pho Metro, granted I was looking for a different Pho place and was redirected here! the apps we got were amazing, the rice dish was so tasty and the pho itself was bomb! I personally can't finish a pho myself but this was just so good! The Vietnamese iced coffee was great too!I love the food here and the atmosphere. But I ordered the chicken sliders and I got like a pea sized dot of the ranch dressing that's supposed to be on there. Also, she brought an extra ice tea and she said don't worry about it. Which led me to believe it'd be taken off our bill but it wasn't. Also had to ask for lemons for the calamari. I didn't see any peppers with that like the menu mentioned. Do they run out of stuff and just pass it off as complete?I had the best of time the name means something like in  French: habitational name from Le Mont in Vosges or possibly other minor places so named from Old French mont 'mountain'.
This restaurant is located on top of Mount Washington with a good view of Pittsburgh. The food is excellent. Service is very good as well.  there for special occasions.  
These folks made my visit memorable I am not one to live in the past, so I am going back I my  people were from France before the 30 years war would realize how far we have come to eat at such a find establishment. Food or the lack of it was such a big deal in the old country. 

I just can not say enough good about the team running Le Mont  I told the folks at work about it the next day. The gorgeous painting and the chandeliers were so beautiful the view of the city was impressive .Thanks again for having meMy friend recently clarified for me, there are two Bhan Mi restaurants right beside eachother. One is better than the other....

I went to the less tasty Bhan Mi my first time (green sign). My tofu Bhan Mi was so bland. I was stuck having not eaten all day and starving, so I stuffed it down. Blah, just so darn bland...

I mentioned to my friend my tasteless Bhan Mi experience. She explained there are two right beside eachother, and to head to Bhan Mi Nguyen Huong (yellow sign!) next time.

She was indeed correct. My lemongrass tofu sub at Nuguyen was excellent!!! I will return for more tasty subs. At only $2 a sub, its a deal.

They also have fresh rolls, noodles and other meal options at incredibly affordable prices.Had a lunch here. Definte asian fusion sandwich. Food was really good. Only minus is place is really busy and packed. Well, it shows they make some good food.Wow. The most incredible food\/overall dining experience I could have asked for. Or waiter, David, was amazing. Super knowledgeable, great personality, super attentive. 

The menu was hard to read so we basically let David recommend dishes for us. We started out with smoked meat croquettes and a meat\/mackerel spread on toast. It was all just great. 

For dinner, I ordered the roast duck with fois gras. It exceeded all expectations (which were very high) cooked perfectly and full of flavor. The roasted apples and potatoes were a nice touch. Hands down the best thing I ate in Montréal. My boyfriend had a steak (can't remember which) and French fries. All great! Steak was medium rare to rare which was wonderful. 

We ordered a delicious peach sorbet with shortbread for dessert which was fabulous. Overall, the best dining experience. Be sure to book reservations MONTHS in advance-it's worth it! No complaints whatsoever.Not a bad place to eat but there is literally no view, it's a little dark and the food has a bit too much salt in it.  But, it has excellent portions, an extensive wine list and very good service.

I was happy with my roasted duck and would recommend it to people looking for a place to grab a quick bite after work in a sit-down setting.First off the food was awesome.  I got the garlic knots and a calzone with a side salad. Service was great as well. The only reason not a 5 star? Its a pizza joint...if I could I would've given 4.5 *s. My only complaint isn't against the establishment,  but to the parents who allow their children to run around in public like deranged banshees. Seriously!  If I EVER thought to act that way in public I wouldn't jave been able to sit for a week! But overall I'm sure I'll be back...just not order soo much food.Really good! I have allergies to peanuts, so I called ahead and they said they don't use peanuts in cooking anything, BUT they have peanut options you can add (peanut sauces, chopped peanuts). So, there is a CHANCE of contamination, but the food is SO GOOD.

If you're getting a drink, get it WITH your food, or else it'll be $1 more expensive on its own.Typical Korean food in Chinatown. There is a large selection on their menu - noodles, appetizers, soups, stews, rice, etc. The prices are definitely very reasonable\/cheap. I got a bowl of soup with rice cake, wontons, and beef slices for $9.99. Food was seasoned well - not too salty. If you aren't a fan of spicy food, do be forewarned that around 80% of the menu is spicy! Good range of  "appetizer" dishes with cucumber, radishes, bean sprouts, kimchi and more. Service was good overall, and the environment was nice, apart from the fact that the TV's were always playing live music concerts of Korean artists, so there wasn't much to see there.

Our table of 4 went for dinner on a Thursday night, and at any given point in the night, there were at most 5 tables there, so it should be relatively easy to find a spot there weeknights. They do only take cash and debit for transactions over $20.As a Malaysian, I really enjoyed this place. Reminds me of my home country. The food is great. 
The people are friendly. It is my go-to place when I crave some Malaysian food. 
I recommend the Laksa, Nasi Lemak, Cha Qeuy Teau, Ice Kacang, well....everything....haha. 

Oh yea...the roti canai. 

Bring the Satey!!!best 锅贴 of my life so juicy so fried so big so yummy literally highlight of my day 

I would come here again!!! 锅贴 for lifeWhile attending to some pre-xmas meat-buying errands, I passed Babe's and decided to stop in for lunch on my way home.  Tucked in to a tiny hole in the wall next to a mini mart on W117 is exactly the sort of pedigree one looks for in a soul food restaurant so I was excited to pop in and see what they had to offer.

Chicken and waffles?  Check!
Macaroni and Cheese? Check!
BBQ Pig's Feet?  Check! 

The list goes on.

While i was really happy to find a source for fried chicken closer to home, I will definitely be making the slightly longer trip to Babe's in the future when the urge strikes.  Everything I tried (fried chicken, yams, mac and cheese, greens, pigs feet) on this trip was excellent, and they were super friendly despite being swamped with xmas catering orders.  

Stumbling across Babe's was an awesome surprise.We stopped in after a concert down the street. It's hard to find something that is still serving food at 11PM but they were so we gave them a try. They only serve pizza at that hour but it was delicious. It's a little on the high end side but not stuffy (we were in concert tees and jeans and didn't feel out of place) and for as fancy as the pizza is it's not overly pricey.

We got the Pittsburgh pizza with potato and onions on it and could not have been happier. My wife got a Moscow Mule and said it was perfect.

The staff was attentive and very nice. I'd gladly come back.We came to TopGolf for the Colors R&b event and we weren't sure what to except but we ended up having a great time. The atmosphere was great and even though it was freezing outside we were still pretty warm because there were plenty of the outdoor heaters. I ordered the burger and my sister ordered the shrimp and both were great. Our server was very nice and we had a nice night. I should have purchased a bay to golf though. Next time for sure.My first review ever! Love edamame sauce!!! Amazing! I love it so much I put it on everything I ordered-- I was even trying to think if I can patent this and sell it to sriracha. Any way I have tried a little bit of the mac n cheese which also amazing and I think this sauce would make the Mac n cheese the best in the world- this idea sounds so good that I would be willing to take a whole bottle of lactose intolerant pills to eat it.Order here two times a week usually. Their pad thai is amazing, and I just discovered the thai yellow chicken curry which is now my new go to. Crab Rangoon is a bit chewy and not the best in town but still good. Delivery is always quick and hot. Definitely try this place if you like thai food!Found this place as we were driving by wondering what we felt like for lunch. Glad we stopped because this place is a keeper. The staff is legit, service is decent considering how busy it was during the lunch rush and the food is just amazing. 

We had our usual fare at any Thai place. The dishes we use to measure our fondness for the place. Yellow curry and pad thai. The lunch portions are good for a good price. The yellow curry had tons of chicken in it and was delicious. The pad thai was tasty and peanutty...just how I like it. 

I'd like to go back and try their Tom kha Kai - the coconut milk soup and I wanted to try their dessert - mango with sticky rice - but I was already too full to handle it. That's okay, another reason to go back.Good place for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

Over the past 2 months my husband and I have visited Times Square 4 separate times.  We first went for Breakfast, rather surprised that an Italian restaurant served breakfast - we figured we would give it a try.  Service was timely and friendly.  Breakfast was reasonably priced and tasty.  

We have had dinner twice tasting a variety of pasta dishes.  The mozzarella appetizer is excellent.  I would pass on the Lemon-butter Parpardelle with 3 jumbo shrimp.  The shrimp still had the shell on them...that is super annoying.  Nothing like digging through your pasta with your fingers to prep the food.  The sauce was super bland.

We last visited for lunch and enjoyed a pizza.  The crust was crunchy and did not fall apart.  It was not greasy and the toppings tasted fresh.  

Heidi is an excellent server, we will definitely ask for her again when we go back.I hate to give this place a bad review since, I love the owners Mark, Donnie and Paul, but I cannot give it a good one. I took my mom, and daughter for lunch on Friday. Restaurant seemed very crowded, but we got a seat quickly. Our waiter was ok, but the food was not. I would call it very, very expensive fast food. My mom got a burger with mushrooms and cheese. My daughter and I got the patty melt. We split and order of fries and onion rings. My mom's burger came out without mushrooms, and when she told the waiter, instead of remaking it, he brought her out a little plastic cup with cold ugly looking mushrooms in it. She just put it off to the side and did not put it on her burger. The patty melts were good, but very greasy. The fries which are sold separate were in a small cup for $3.50, not worth the price and the onion rings were not edible. They use red onions cut very thin which is fine, but they were very cold, soggy and they had absolutely no color, they had raw flour coating them. There are too many burger joints out there that is 100x better than this. I will not be back.This may as well be our kitchen, we seem to eat more here than we do at home:)   The staff is always awesome, the food is really good and the price is just right.  Really like the ability to get restaurant quality food, with complementary chips and salsa, without a server.  WE LOVE SOMEBURROS!Don't even. My friend picked a room for us to stay at somewhere near the convention center. Biggest mistake either. Just mentioning this place to a stranger and they pucker, so there's definitely a reputation. Upon entry and drop off by Uber, you have to take a mile long hike to the reception counter. Taxis, are no problem. They sell the upgrade upon check in to the tower. Why that sounds amazing so why not spend an extra $7 per night. I think that's a racket because you have to walk yet another mile to the room, oh and transfer elevators and get easily lost. In fact, if you're not good with general directions, this is just not the place for you. I was asked for directions multiple times. We saw an empty wine glass sit next to the elevators for at least 3 days. Upon closer inspection along the baseboards on any of the hallways, look at the baseboard. There is a distinct layer of dust that hasn't been vacuumed in years. Even near the elevators you'll note the same thing. We haven't even got to the rooms yet. The rooms are sparse. Motel like really. No real amenities, but if you like creepy crawly friends, they have those. Flicked on the light to the bathroom and a roach scurried along. They offered to move us, but where there's one, there are many and we chose to take the higher route. My friend even has the video as proof. They ended up giving us a small credit, but if you don't want to take friends home or make friends while in your room, I'd suggest finding another place altogether.Postino is great! I was in with my boyfriend for brunch today. He had the French toast and I had the granola. Both were very reasonably priced and so good! Our server was attentive and everything was brought correctly and quickly to us. I've been to this postino and others several times before for panini, bruschetta, and wine. Always a lovely experience! Postino is one of my favorites. Well priced and well worth it.Great service, delicious taste, good portion and affordable price. 

They take credit\/debit and cash but no Amex.  

Yelp Check In offer: 1 free ice cream per yelp check in (black sesame or green tea)

A small little place across from Le Baron on Woodbine south of Hwy 7.

They offer take out where they have separate containers for the noodles and the soup.

Pricing start at around  $11 for Ramen. They have $5 beef tendon donburi which is very soft and satisfying.

They have a page for sake and beer ($6 sapporo and $4.50 sleeman) but they do not have it yet.

They charge for tea and pop. Water is complimentary though.

It's a little squishy when seated because of how close the seats are to each other. Their noodles are at perfect texture but a bit different from the usual places such as Kinton and Sensotei. 

They have a broth that's anchovies based. A bit fishy but interesting.  

When leaving they bid their farewells in Japanese. Nice little place to try.Great exhaust system, thoroughly enjoyed ms Lee preparing the meat and cooking for us.Altogether a pleasant experience. A bit noisy though, good for family and friendsI had never heard of this place before but my friend recommended it and I am glad she did. However, the experience at first wasn't great as the hostess informed us (on a Saturday night) that we may need to wait for 2.5 hours.

1.5 hours later we ended up calling them (they do take your name and cell phone number so they can text you) and luckily most of the people ahead of us did not want to wait. 

I have never heard of seafood boil before and it was definitely a new experience. The food came fairly quickly and the staff were quite efficient despite having many clients. 

Tried 2 flavours of shrimp, crawfish, Cajun fries and mussels. The crawfish and mussels are my top 2 so far that I have tried. 

RecommendedThis place is a gem, hands down!  The watermelon Sangria is amazing!  We had Halibut, Short Ribs, Del Patron and Camarones a la Diabla family style.  We couldn't decide what was the best entree!  In our indecision, we ate the most fabulous dessert, the bread pudding.  Chef Oscar, from Columbia, visited with us.  So down to earth and nice!  This is a must in Vegas!The view alone deserves an excellent review. This restaurant is located inside the Hyatt Regency hotel... a circular shaped building that spins (yes, spins) to give you a rotating view of the entire city. It's absolutely beautiful and the ambiance is incredibly romantic. 

I ordered the Double Cut Lamb Rack and he ordered the Angus Ribeye. The meat was cooked exactly the way we requested... we both prefer medium and the chef figured out the perfect balance of not to bring it out bloody - but not overcooked either. We finished off with the Creme Brulee Cheesecake, some fancy chocolate cake and a red wine our server recommended. I definitely LOVED the dessert more... SO much so that he had to remind me how many hours we would be in the gym tomorrow. Talk about a sugar buzz kill...

The wait staff are friendly and consistently check on you. We didn't have to wait for water refills or the bill to come out. I was definitely impressed.

It is, however, a pricey restaurant (prepare to spend about $150 for two people) but I think it was well worth it.Cheap, fast, whole in the wall with quality food and service. Three times so far and have no complaints. Their "fresh ginger" is delicious with chicken. Their spicy chicken wings are really good as well. Tried their chicken satay, very good. Papaya salad was ok bit on the strong side. Calamari was different, big pieces, but very good. Crab fries rice also good but not all of the crab was shelled good enough so sometimes really hard shell pieces.. This place is all around good though, specially if you don't make a reservation at Lotus of Siam, don't want to want but still want yummy Thai food.Abuelo's has always been kind of a mixed bag.  

I really like the variety of salsas they provide with their chips, most notably, the green pineapple. If they don't give it to you with your order of chips, I'm pretty sure you can still request it.

I'm a huge fan of their signature papas con chile and consider it an essential side for whatever you order. It's a great deviation from the usual rice and beans you get at pretty much every sit-down Mexican restaurant in existence.  

As for the entrees themselves, I've had their chimichanga and found it to be acceptable. I've also had their Del Rio, which is a combination platter that has an enchilada, taco, and tamale. For some reason, none of them really seemed to pop in flavor. I requested a side of chili con queso, which I was told would cost extra. It ended up being almost four dollars extra. Seriously? It wasn't worth it, as I've had better elsewhere.

For dessert, the only thing we've ever had is their tres leches, which isn't the best I've ever had, but is decent enough by the standards of a chain.

They emphasize that all of their food is made from scratch and is completely fresh. Some stuff? Probably. But virtually everything? Eh. They're probably cutting some corners back there somewhere - as the food really tastes no better than all of the other "Americanized" Mexican chains in Phoenix.

I'm not a big fan of the tablets at the table. I don't even want to imagine the amount of germs built-up on these things. I'm sure it makes things easier on the servers, as well as customers that don't want to wait around to pay their bill, but there's just something about the concept that declassifies the restaurant (a la Olive Garden), despite having very beautiful décor.

There's a few other things I want to try on their menu (namely their fajitas), so I'm sure we'll swing by here every once in awhile. Personally, I'd be content if they served me a giant bowl of papas con chile and nothing else.  

Go in with realistic expectations and you'll be fine.We used to be semi-regular take out and delivery customers. No more! 

Last two times were terrible. Meat in bento boxes ($15) is poor quality and very overcooked. Beef looked like shoe leather. No vegetables only a lot of rice and bland over cooked meat. Salad is a couple of pieces of iceberg lettuce (somehow the only part of the head they have to offer is the chunky white interior because that's all anyone in my family ever gets).

They even skimped on the fruit -- the two pieces of orange I got put together was half a slice.  

Tempura is good and sushi is OK ( defined as not horrible). 

Seriously, Leasiders why are you eating there, there are better Japanese places nearby!I had lunch there today and quite liked my meal. I had a basic all you can eat meal with sushi and kitchen items. The food presentation was a step up compared to 168 Sushi, Tokyo Maki and 520 Sushi. The fish was fresh. The IPad menu was easy to use. I appreciated the real chop sticks rather than wooden ones with slivers. Prices were lower than the prices at the Mississauga sushi restaurants that I have been frequenting lately. In other words, my 
lunch was very good value.

This restaurant is better than the two previous (Hockey Sushi and 88 Sushi) restaurants in that location.I highly recommend this restaurant if you are in Vegad, the food is very good, and the customer service is awesome.Worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant. First, I ordered a side of French Fries, sent them back since they were freezing, and was provided a new side of fries. Second, got our bill, and was double charged for the fries. Good thing I look at watch I'm being charged for, bill was corrected.  Lastly, went to pay for the bill with a Visa Gift Card and was told they do not accept gift cards, only Zipp's gifts cards.  What?!?!  It is a Visa Gift Card, same as cash!!  If a family of 4 went there and ordered dinner relying on their Visa gift card, and had no other means of paying for their dinner, what would they do?!?!  No where do they have it displayed that they do not accept gift cards.  Probably should be plastered all over the front door, on every table, and at the bar.  Setting people up for severe failure.  I will never return for the sake of myself and others.  And I will let all others know for the sake of not being screwed over.  Absolutely ridiculous!!A different take on the standard Thai food we've all come to love. Northern Thai is an appropriate description as there is certainly crossover with Burmese cuisine. Saw some veggies go to another table- so we asked for the same. Marigold. Nice crunch and nice to have veggies with all the carbs we've been eating lately. Coconut water was fresh. Didn't have any of the mixed fruity drinks, but they certainly looked delicious if you are in the mood for that. The place has a fun tropical dive bar atmosphere - good for happy hour or a night out!I have eaten at my fair share of sandwich places, and am typically a JMikes kind of girl.  However, after eating at this place several times over the past few months, they are by far my new fave!!

So first off, the value that you get for your money here just blows me away.  Basically, you're paying the same prices as Subway but getting a MUCH MUUUUUCH better gourmet legit sandwich.  I love that they're super accommodating, and will customize any sandwich for you, toast it, do different bread--- whatever you want!

My favorite is the pressed TCB (with the original toppings + black olives), but the Reuben, the ham\/cappicola\/chz, and the Italian are all awesome too.  

During the course of us eating here, I've actually gotten pregnant, and I LOVE the fact that they toast my sandwiches up to the proper temp so I can still eat them :).  That's a big deal when you're having serious sandwich cravings that most places can't accommodate lol.  They have this special toaster thing that makes them all melty and yummy without being soggy.

Definitely worth a try, you won't be disappointed.We came here on New Years Eve with some old friends - looking forward to some great Italian food. We left a little disappointed.

We started with some appetizers - the calamari was awesome, and the kids liked the mozzarella sticks. The hot antipasti for two was good, with the exception of the mussels (maybe just a preference of mine). We ordered two platters for seven of us and it was more than enough. 
Dinner is where the struggles came.

Special tonight - lobster tail with scallops in a scampi sauce over linguini - who could resist it? We ordered two of them. Also ordered chicken parm, shrimp scampi, osco buco, chicken francaise (not on the menu but they said they make it) and a side of linguini and clams. 

I'll start by saying our food came out before they started clearing our appetizers and salad, and there was stuff everywhere, stacked and ready to tip over. 

The chicken parm did not disappoint, the guys loved it and the portions were very large. And the Osco buco was so tender and flavorful. Really special. 
The lobster tails were so over cooked and tough that we could not get the meat out of the shell. And two of us ordered the same meal, one of us got five scallops and the other one (me) got 3.  We told our waiter  when he came back about the lobster and he said either give me your whole plate and order something else, or keep it. He did say it wasn't him it was his manager, but "say what"? We said can't we just keep the plate and you bring new lobster tails. He came back and said all he could do was take $10 off each plate. Ok we said. So much for lobster tonight. 
The chicken francaise was COVERED in mushrooms. If you like them, that's awesome. If you don't, and don't expect them, it kind of ruins the meal. When we asked, the waiter said they always serve mushrooms with their francaise (never seen that before but ok) so my daughter took them off. She ordered gnocchi on the side but it was a bit doughy. 
The pizza we ordered for our 3 year old came our about ten minutes after our food, we can only assume the forgot the first time around. 
Drink refills were slow, again I assume because it was busy. 
All in all we will go back, but thought the review was fair.I have to start by admitting that I am generally an all-you-can-eat fan. I like sushi in all forms, but my usual mood is "give me everything you have until I want to die because I am so full of fish." These places, I am aware, offer more food of less quantity. Bocho sushi is the opposite; you may not get a ton of food, but the quality is excellent! This spot does not offer all you can eat. I came here for dinner with a friend because we had a $25 off coupon. Due to my normal stance on sushi restaurants, I was pretty sure this would be my one and only time eating here, and I was absolutely wrong! I really enjoyed my meal, and I will definitely be back. 

First off, the atmosphere is a small, hip place with an upstairs loft and downstairs sushi bar. We sat at the bar, but we did walk up to look at the loft - it was enticing, but I wanted some of that real sunshine the downstairs area provided. When you sit at the sushi bar, you can see everything they are doing, which is cool. Unfortunately, when I was there it did not look very organized compared to other sushi bars I have sat at. Also, my waiter did not refill my water for almost half an hour, and it was not a busy day\/time. This led to what might be called a funny mistake, as a random man walked up to us and asked us if the food was up to par. I assumed he was the manager and replied that it was, but I have not gotten any water since we sat down, and he looked very confused! It turned out he was just some creep talking to us. He came by a few more times and asked us about our food, even though he was just a customer, as we were. It was weird, to say the least, but a good story to laugh about! 

THAT FISH THOUGH!! I tried yellowtail first, and I was hooked. Every piece was so buttery and smooth. All together I ordered a Screaming Orgasm, some edamame, two orders of sushi, and a Rainbow Roll. Together it came out to almost double the price I pay for eight times the amount of food at my regular spot. However, this food was at least twice as fresh and amazing, so I'm not mad about it! I ordered the Rainbow Roll specifically because after trying the yellowtail I knew I needed something with a lot of fish on it, minus some of the extreme toppings on other rolls that cover the flavor. I probably won't be a regular, but I will come back for a quick fix when I am craving some buttery amazing sushi\/rolls or maybe on a special occasion when I am looking to up my sushi game. 

Quick Summary: Relatively expensive, but the food is bomb.Super breakfast in a real institution.   Great cheese steak omelet, wife loved eggs Benedict,  kids loved the French toast.   Cash only.   Walking around the strip district is interesting as well.   Parked for $5 down the road in a gravel lot ( car full of luggage).Sat us at a 2 person table and then voluntarily upgraded us to a freshly clean booth.  Food came quick and was delicious. Customer service was fantastic.Love Love this Little Place...the cuisine is just wonderful so delicious the food presentation is beautiful as well! The staff is very friendly, restaurant is very nice and CLEAN and very accommodating, we have been here 3 times to dine in and have ordered takeout, they are consistent with their dishes. Delicious!! A MUST GO TO!!Although the waitstaff was good, the food was underwhelming. I had the classic burger with onion rings. The onion rings were greasy and the burger was nothing special.Great atmosphere, very cool vibes. Service was subpar. VERY slow server... not busy at all. Seemed like we waited twenty minutes just to get our checks. Pork I got was dry, still had a good flavor. Willing to come back... but never if I'm in a hurry.I really just had to eat here. I've seen this place so many times from the drive from California to Texas. On my visit to Arizona I made it a must try before I headed home to CA. It's a diner of course with truck drivers that eat here. The waffles here are excellent! The only place that make it better would be Roscoe's in CA. They were made to perfection here. I coulda ate just that. I also got eggs, sausages, toast ,and hashbrowns with country gravy. Everything was typical sort of like Denny's. The waffles though were like WOW. 

Recommendation: WAFFLES!God has blessed us with such a magnificent place!! I wish they would open one closer to Phoenix! I always get the sale with sweet potatoes and steak with balsamic dressing! The Line is always quick and convenient, the staff is usually friendly! I will
Definitely come back here when I want a salad that will truly fill you up!If you make chai tea lattes, they will come! At the very least, I'd show up for sure, lol!

This location is small, has some indoor seating and outdoor seating. 

Service is friendly, but they always seem to be training new batistas when I visit of late & the wait time to get my drink (not order) seems to be higher than in most other locations. 

The drinks are as great, as always :)We always stop by here on the way out of town, got the breakfast special,a great deal- under $15 for 2 with drink, service was good and restrooms clean and tidy.coffe was hot and tasty. We will be back!Some of the best original tasting New York style pizza you'll find in Las Vegas. I personally prefer the meat calzone, and my husband prefers just the plain pie. Of course, we always have to get birch beer when we go, or just wouldn't be like New York.
The staff definitely has a New York 'hard edge' to their service, mannerisms, but hey, I figure that adds to the experience that so similar to New York and New Jersey!I really really really want to give this place more than 3 stars...but I can't. I think this place has the potential to be 5-Stars, and the owners are SO NICE, but it's just not there yet.

The decor is great! Sort of feels like part museum and part restaurant. I loved having all of the animals around. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Kind of had a down-home feel to the service that contrasted with the slightly upscale ambiance. I guess I was expecting more from the food though.

The only 2 standouts for the whole meal were the Bread Rolls and the Pork & Beef Chili that they served for soup tonight. The rest was underwhelming. We ordered the Meat Loaf with Mashed Potatoes, Spinach Salad, 8oz Filet Mignon with Baked Potato, side of Fries. None of it was really bad...just not outstanding either. But the Spinach Salad was overdressed to the point of sogginess. And the Filet Mignon seemed a bit tough...especially for one that was cooked Medium Rare.

Anyway, I'd really love for this place do well. The owners are very nice, and the decor is cool. Hopefully the food will catch up soon. I may be back to give it another shot, but I think I'll wait a little while.Excellent service! 

Had my favorite Peruvian dish (Saltado de Pollo y Lomo); Tasted great! 
Make sure to ask for mixed-in fries if that's what you like (i will next time).

Best Peruvian food in AZ!Worst Mexican restaurant ever, roaches crawling in the bathroom, employees poorly treated by management\/owners and constantly closing between business hours. I STRONGLY DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!I like 5 Guys' burgers.  They make them to order.  The fries are a bit over rated.  They tend to get soggy if you don't eat them right away, like right when you get them and  before you eat your burger.  Mostly I think people rave about these fries because you get so many.  I'd recommend the burgers, but pass on the fries unless you're planning on sharing them and eating them fast.When my man and I are in the mood for Chinese take-out, we call up Food Express and drive over since they don't do take out. It's so worth it, more than the luxury of delivery. Movie nights would be complete if they would.

I urge you to try the jellyfish appetizer! spiced and slightly pickled, its REAL GOOD.
Our other favorite is the Honey Shrimp. It's like candy.
The only thing we didn't like so far was the Duck tongue in xo sauce. The bone inside made it really awkward to eat.

So glad to find knockout Chinese in vegas. SCORE.Some of the food is cheaply priced, but that's because it's cheap. The cheese sandwiches are made from processed cheese, and the meat in the Western sandwich was so gross it made me feel nauseous, and I couldn't finish it. The coffee is decent and cheap. My main qualm with the restaurant is that the last time I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich, the owner (is his name Tom?) took my money, rinsed his hands for a max of 2 seconds without soap, and then flipped my sandwich with the help of one hand. Ugh... no. The other reviews describe the typical clientele, which represents atmosphere of the place.I didn't get to go to the patisserie myself, but my husband went to get a cake for his sister's birthday and he brought home a mini cannoli to try. It was delicious and filled with fresh creamy filling. My husband thought it was the best cannoli he's ever had. He's not Italian, but has had a fair share of cannolis. He said the cannoli was made to order so it was really fresh. The cake was just made too.

Can't wait to try this beautiful cake, which my husband grabbed before they put it on display

Should have taken a picture of the cannoli. We will surely be back and try other goodies.So......how fat I wanted to get during my vacation?

Hm....let me think about this.....lol

I'm just like all American's, loving the French Fries + salt and pepper, then I went to Outback Steak House and discovered the Cheese Fries, and the Beacon Chess Fries, and..... now travel to Montreal I discovered they're more......to it, much much more...... lol 

We was just walking around the old Montreal and my friend told me about Poutine, so I used my yelp apps and search what close by and this little restaurants popped up. 

Great location, a train stop on the other side, I'm thinking approx .05 mile walking distance, you can check with the hotel concierge, the train there is very easy to take, it only cost $8.00 CAD for a whole day pass, you can ride as many times as you like all day. 

So now back to the location, this little restaurant located in a good area, they're many shops walking distance

My friend and I decided to try out the Montreal Poutine since they're famous for that

The place set up like a little school cafeteria with cheap chairs and table that you can easily knock it down 

The place is small, they're a small outdoor in the back
They serve alcohol as well

I ordered the smoked meat Poutine and my friend ordered the Italian Poutine. I never had a Poutine before, and I thought it was pretty good, but the only problem is, I guess I hardly eat anything this greasy, so my stomach did not agree with me, and.... you know the rest. lol 

If I travel to the area, I will stop by again for sure, but I will probably order 1 and share with my friends. 

So make sure if you are travel to Montreal, go try out the famous POUTINE!! lolUsed to be great, now there's a new owner. He smokes inside the store. Menu the same, but the portions are smaller. Sad, I won't go back.Came here for dinner 2 weeks ago. Absolutely amazing! Great service, modern beautiful dining room. 
The food was delicious. The tasting menu is paced perfectly, and dishes were all delicious. Chef Levine is very creative with not only flavors, but presentation as well. Wine parings were also spot-on as well and I recommend getting them. 
It is located in Scottsdale Art walk area. Great for a stroll after dinner or people watching while eating.

If you were miss Binkley's in Cave Creek since it closed, come here. You wont miss it any more I assure you. Were truly fortunate to have a place this wonderful,  in this city.I wish I could give 10 stars in a review, because clearly 5 is not enough. 
This place is unreal. I probably had the most amazing vegetarian meal of my life. Let me start by saying that I am not a vegetarian at all  as I do consume some meats, but I truly enjoy good quality vegetarian meals. Buddha Chay delivers exceptional food that makes a non vegetarian consider becoming vegetarian. We had excellent service and tried a few different dishes and simply loved each of them.
Buddha Chay will be a place I will visit on a regular basis now, and I encourage you to give it a try.The service was horrible...I've been to this restaurant before and I truly enjoyed it but when I came back for fathers days brunch it just seems like  the staff didn't care..we couldn't get a refill and everything took forever and the waiter had an attitude when I ask for helped cause the one assigned to us disappeared...I probably won't be back and rather go to Texas de Brazil instead same price but better service.Came here with a group of 8. We were the only people here for the most part. At some point 2 other people sat.
 The food was not good. Every dish was overcooked. The "special " steak was awful. The salmon was so cooked and dry that we asked for lemons to wet it down. 
 The service was not good either. We were lacking in silverware and drinks the whole time. 
The ladies room had nothing to dry your hands with while every employee sat at the bar and chatted.


I will not be back for sure.My husband and I have been frequently been coming to this establishment since it opened. The last 2 times we have been there it hasn't been a good experience. The first time it was on president day, the person that was working at the time ( whom I have never met or seen there before) her name is Elizabeth. There was not that many people in the pub. There was 2 guys at the bar that she was having conversation with and did not come over to us for awhile. It took so long that I was the only one that ordered then we left. The second time was today march 3. We came in and it was her again. There was only a couple at the bar but she worked on the sign behind the bar for awhile. She finally came over and we ordered drinks and food but we didn't get our food for a good half hour. She had disappeared in the back for awhile. In that time a family of 4 came in and then they left because of no service and then 2 more people came in then they left she was still in the back. Then she finally comes out with a bottle of champagne and that took awhile. Finally the food came out and at that point it was not good we ate some of it but not very good. Another couple came in and they ordered and got their food in a timely matter. The cook brought their food out for them, I don't understand why that could not have happened for us. Needless to say if I go back I will not stay if she is working there.Love this. Best Mexican. Food is tasty and healthy. Very generous portion of food. Great if you're in a hurry. All locations same yummy food.This is my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. It's consistently fantastic. I've had just about everything on their menu at this point and nothing is less than delicious. It's a staple for us on New Years Eve and they never let us down. 

The owner\/Hostess is the perfect Host and all of the wait staff are extremely professional. Environment is good for a romantic dinner or a family outing. 

For the record and being from New York originally, I'm a bit of a food snob and pretty hard to please.....not lying to you here when I say, you will not be let down by this restaurant.Extremely poor service there are Or employees then the guest in the place, and still there is more than an hour wait to get food. Nobody seems to care. Nobody came and apologized.I visited the Wynn buffet at the end of September and was pleasantly surprised.  Out of all of the buffets I've been to of all the times I've been to Las Vegas, Bacchanal was an epic fail, Wicked Spoon had great desserts and some good savory dishes, but Wynn had the best savory food section.  The roasted meats section was meh overall (I thought the prime rib was tasteless and the lamb chops were tough and hard to chew through), but the sausages?  Party in the mouth!  And what was that?  Truffle mashed potatoes?  Whaaa?? DELICIOUS.  Majority of the other dishes in the hot food section were very tasty and satisfying.

However.  HOWEVER, the desserts were a huge and epic fail.  We literally tried almost one of each kind of dessert only to take a bite and not want anymore.  Had to go back up to get more of the hot foods as to not ruin the taste in our mouths. If Wicked Spoon had the best desserts, Wynn probably had the best hot\/entree foods.  Please just join forces to create a super buffet!The worst Asian food in the area. We had soba, udon and sushi. The soba was over cooked, the seafood in my soup was over cooked. My husband had udon, but it was spaghetti. Then sushi was ugly and warm. We are not coming back again.The falafel was moist!! The hummus was very smooth and tasty. The house dressing is also good! My only comment would be to tzaziki with the falafels! Everything was delicious! I also had the Buffalo chicken dip! Very good!!The Harry Buffalo in Elyria is pretty good for the most part. The food has always been pretty good and the restaurant itself is nice. The wait staff could use some improvement (asked for another minute to look over the menu and them not returning for 10-15 minutes or more and stuff like forgetting that you are even there after being first sat at a table). Overall a good restaurant and I plan on eating there again.It's a good place to go for some authentic mexican food. The workers were nice and the atmosphere was inviting. It's small on the inside but not cramped. I got the tamale with rice and beans on the side. The brand were really good. The tamale was good but could have used a little bit more flavor. You get big portions. I would recommend for anyone in the area.When I came in, I ate in the bar area. The atmosphere and food were fantastic. Anthony, Joe, and Miguel were the bartenders working. There service was excellent and there recommendations were also great. Overall, it was a great experience and I will definitely recommend it to everyone coming to the Vegas area!I waited 30 minutes for their "Best of Phoenix" Grilled Cheese and Herb Parmesan fries. Both were plain and were not savory at all, and I still can't believe it was $16. For a cafe to be attached to the Phoenix Art Museum, I expect better quality. There are much better places within a mile radius making amazing food for half that price. I suggest eating elsewhere if you want to get a bite to eat before or after the museum.First time visit with our two boys and they did not disappoint. Our server McKenley made our experience special. He made great suggestions on beer and brought out samples until we were sold on our favorites. The service was great! We had the bacon and beer cheese fries which were filling and really hit the spot. The burgers are flavorful with the most amazing bun I've ever tasted. 
We will definitely return and we'll be requesting McKenley for sure. His personality and his knowledge of the menu made our first time experience perfect!Where do I start?!

I love this place!!!  

This place serves both vietnamese and thai food - two of my favourite cuisines!  

I have visited this restaurant several times and also had the pleasure of tasting my friends' dishes as well.

First off, they serve the best Bun Bo Hue I have ever tasted in a restaurant.  Every time I visit a vietnamese restaurant, I order the Bun Bo Hue and 99% of the time, I am disappointed.  Fortunately, the Bun Bo Hue at Tuong Lai is FABULOUS!!!!

Other favourites include:  shrimp tempura, grilled chicken, yellow chicken curry (VERY YUM), and red shrimp curry.

The restaurant is beautifully decorated with really flattering lighting - making it a great "date" restaurant.

Service was excellent.  Waitress was attentive, efficient, and really cute.The staff are super friendly! The food is excellent! I usually order the chicken quesadilla.The staff here is extremely polite and courteous. I haven't been to a Einstein bagels in years I completely forgot how delightful the food is here. I ordered two bagels which only took about 3 minutes to make. If your looking for some fast service I definitely would recommend this place.Mediocre food with extremely horrible service. The staff was not only rude to the customers, but were fighting with each other. The guy who took our order had a chip on his shoulder and treated us as if we were annoying him. He didn't listen to my order and when I told him he messed up, he told me that he already placed my food in the oven...kinda a "oh-well" to it. The baked goods were not good enough for me to come back and deal with all of the negativity that was in that place tonight. I'm sorry Amelie's but you have lost yet another paying customer.I liked the style of this place. The menu, though a bit confusing at first, draws you into the whole apothecary feeling with glossy white bar, clean decor and drinks with small spoons in them solidifying it.  I had a raspberry vodka with li-chi juice and it was tasty and fairly inexpensive - $7. 

The crowd - I'd say half-and-half.  There were a couple of groups "hunting" but there were some cool artsy types as well..Great food and atmosphere! We enjoyed the all enjoyed Bloody Mary's and Mimosas (Pineapple and Grapefruit) and the below...

Boring Beni- Amazing
Chicken & Waffle - Amazing 
Chicken Beni- Amazing 
Salmon Beni - Awesome but would probably do the Chicken Beni versus Salmon 

Can't wait to go back!I thought this place was getting better as I've been there a couple times and service seemed to be good. Today proved to me once again wrong. The drive-through people were cocky and unattentative and really could've cared less. Got home my order was incorrect once again I'm done!!!!  I have to give one star else it would be zeroAny time I think of a place that is in "Toringdon", I sort of dread it - is it on the left (difficult to get into because of exiting off of 485)? Is it on the right (who knows how to get in there, because of all the people going to Earth Fare)? How will I know? When will I know? Once I find it, how in the world will I get back? Regardless, they do have some decent options, so I keep trying out places, and likely will continue to do so.

In the case of Tsuki, it was reasonable, but I have to say it may not have been worth all the effort. If I lived nearby, then I would likely give them some other chances. Or if I was staying in the hotel across the street, I would perhaps risk my life by scampering across the street to check it out (note: the smallish street to cross near Earth Fare - no way would I scamper across Johnston on foot, I barely do that in a car). 

Service was friendly enough, it just wasn't particularly memorable beyond that, and as a result, it goes back to the bottom of the list in case I'm looking for something different - but there are plenty of other options, even in Toringdon, so I suspect it won't be near the top for a good while.Best Spanish food in Cleveland. 
All the menu is great, but I die for octopus and paella. 
Very nice service. 
And the sangria is really good.We have dined at this establishment 4 times in the past.  The service and food quality has always been interestingly delicious and the service has always been 4 star worthy. Tonight the three of us showed up and decided to sit st the bar so we could watch the penguin game on their tiny tv's. We were pleasantly surprised that they had a r&b singer as entertainment. He and his surprise guest were absolutely AWSOME.  Our steaks were Ditka quality and our bartender Casey , made this pricey Sunday dinner worth it.  We will be back, just not very often.Our first stop in the way to work
an event at the expo center. Easy to get to from the highway.

Went with the server's recommendations, chicken & dumplings. Way better than the bland PA Dutchy version! (I live there, I can say that) filling with a side of collards.

Dan liked the blackened salmon special, not too spicy for him. Served  with a dollop of avocado mash.

Didn't stick around for dessert.

They have a bar area. All their side are prepared vegetarian and they have a bunch of veg options for main dishes. I'd like to try the spicy veg loaf. 

Everything served with deviled eggs. Is that a Southern thing?I ate here for the first time today with some co-workers. Yum-meeeeee!!! The small dining room stays busy was customers coming in and out to order the delicious food. Many of the customers looked like regulars. The staff seemed to have a great relationship with the customers as they filtered in and out of the restaurant. Friendly staff that made you feel at home. I'll be going back to this place for sure!The sandwiches are amazing and the customer service as well. Raymond and Steve were super friendly and recommended the thanksgiving sandwich for the next time I come in!The only reasons this place did not get a five star rating from me is due to the server bringing my table egg roles and won tons that we did not order then coming back and taking them away from the table to then take them to the correct table.  Most restaurants would have said "our error" but not this place, they reprocessed the items and gave to the poor Senior Citizens. 

I then asked for a additional gravy for my beef and peppers and was told it would be an extra $1.00. However...the food was really good! I was not happy with the extra charges they wanted to charge for little things like extra gravy and removing peas and carrots from the fried rice.I read about the mocha here and had to try it, being a lover of hot chocolatey coffee beverages anywhere. 

So this place is great! They have one of those molten chocolate machines keeping thick melted chocolate ready to go at all times. 

And you can get it for less than $5 Canadian. 

Nom nom nom.This was the worst pizza I have ever had. First I didn't get everything that was suppose to be on it. While waiting they burnt a pizza and tried to cut the charcoal pieces off and was actually going to serve it to a customer. Thanks but no thanks.So happy this place exists. Its cozy and accommodating, the staff is very warm and always makes you feel welcome. Whether I need a table to work for an afternoon, have a quick drink or to celebrate birthday dinner, I've done all at this wonderful place. This versatility, along with great food and drink, is what makes Boxermans so special.So, I was one of the first 100 people in line for this joint. That means that I won a free burger a week for a year. A pretty good deal for waiting outside overnight. Unfortunately, each time I go to this place, there is one more thing to complain about. 

The first time we went was great! The burger tasted good, although that may have been because of staying up all night with only small snacks to munch on periodically. Regardless! Our order was taken, the staff was friendly, and we received our food promptly and hot. 

The second time, we got our food a little bit slower. I ended up upgrading my free burger to the Salmon burger. I did not care for it. At all. It wasn't cooked badly, it just had a weird combination of ingredients. Capers and teriyaki sauce do NOT go together. Plus, the fish was abnormally fishy. Also, the milkshake we ordered took an unnecessary amount of time to get to our table. My boyfriend had to go up and ask for it and he was the one who ended up bringing it back. 

Tonight was the most recent time we visited Ribs & Burgers. We arrived slightly later than we wanted to and got there at 8:30, which should be fine considering they close at 9. Well, it was a problem. They refused to serve us despite the restaurant being full of individuals eating their meals. Apparently, closing at 9 means they stop serving people at 8:30, which is ridiculous for a restaurant. We traveled all the way to Downtown Summerlin just to eat at Ribs & Burgers and ended up leaving empty handed. Very unprofessional. 

Obviously, we'll be back because of our free burger card, but I probably wouldn't be back here except on occasion for the milkshakes. Can't pass up a milkshake.

UPDATE: Been back a few more times and service is getting progressively better. A friend of mine works here and said they had some communication problems at the beginning but they're getting better each day. I think he's right because my food has been getting to me a lot faster and a waitress I had the other day was very prompt. Moving my stars up from 2 to 3. Let's hope they had a bad case of New Restaurant Blues and they keep improving from here on out.I recommend this place for happy hours 4-6pm $6 drinks and great menu items. The restaurant was very clean and I was super happy how great the staff treated us. Make sure you try the shrimp dynamite tacos!!  Not on happy hour but you will not regret it!! I love everything about this place and was surprised to
Find it in green valley ranch casino. I do recommend you go here for happy hour 4-6 and walk to the district for paint and sip at 7pm! That's what we did for my birthday and I loved every minute of it!! I will be back very soon!!!Our first time here and the food is amazing. My son loves the camp fire s'mores waffles and the fresh fruit smoothies. The ultimate steak and eggs was so flavorful.Filipino food isn't the healthiest thing you could eat but is it good? Yes! I'm half-Filipino so, I think I have the right to be a Filipino food snob. My mom, lola (grandma), and my titas (aunties by blood or my mom's friends) were all cooking machines with an arsenal of fresh ingredients, serving Pinoy dishes at the rate of 5 dishes per minute. Their main goal in life is to feed everyone...all the time! We have family in Manila that frown upon karaoke which is why you won't hear me on the Magic Mic - not that you would want to anyway! LOL.

If I'll have heart disease\/ diabetes (which are common among Filipinos), it better be worth it. They have lechon kawali, crispy pata, kare-kare, lumpia, lumpiang Shanghai, garlic rice, adobo, halo-halo, different kinds of pancit, laing, toci\/tapsi\/longsi-log, etc. People have complained about the lack of circulation and the heat in this place - something I cannot relate to since my family gets me food to-go for me. 

Lechon Kawali:
Fried pork belly. It's a bit confusing how they have "tonkatsu (fried pork belly)" on their menu - this might have been a lost in translation moment. The skin is crisp and simply delicious. I didn't like the sauce it came with which I think is made in house. I prefer Mang Tomas. 3.5\/5

Lumpiang Shanghai:
Fried egg roll with meat and veggies. This is one of the Filipino party staples. You dip  it in sweet and sour sauce and hear the crunch as you chomp on lumpia. Their version is not greasy at all which is an absolutely good thing. 4.5\/5

Chicken Adobo:
I can only eat my mom's adobo. She's the only one who makes it the way I like it. People get butthurt when I don't like their version but oh, well...
We ordered this for my friend who does not eat pork. However, they gave us pork adobo. My friend was left hangry and bad times were had by all. 1\/5Like sweet? Get anything Berry Bliss-style (best pancakes ever). Feeling savory? They've got that covered too - try the Eggs Verde, which resembles an inside-out, breakfast quesadilla, just don't forget the chorizo!

Real, fresh-squeezed juices are a must out on the sunny patio. Outstanding.OK place for the kids birthday parties or group treats.  A little loud for just a family outing but as long as you're aware, which you should be at a place like this then no problem.  

My main reason for taking off two stars is the check out process for redeeming tickets from games.  You get your receipt and pick out what want, problem is you redeem at the same place you are picking allowing indecisive, and sometimes inconsiderate, people to stand there for ever deciding what they want while the person behind them may just redeeming 30-40 tickets and know what they want but they are struck waiting on these people.  Simple solution would be to allow people to see the items not at the same place you redeem the tickets so they can jot down what they want and a separate station to redeem them.  That would seem much more efficient and keep tensions at bay between patrons.

Also had to edit this review and take away another star because my 5 year old's jacket and mine were stolen, yes really.  I also understand a scarf from another lady in our party was taken.  Sad this is what we have come to where people steel from kids at a child oriented restaurant.  

Don't think we'll be returning, if we do we'll be sure to lock up any items and not have anything that needs to be set down.Smoked meat and cocktails are always good, but rarely exceptional. Atmosphere is vibrant, youthful, energetic and lively. Extended wait list are common and front patio has sun 2.5 months of the year. Rear patio is not really a patio - but more of a semi-covered room in which to get rowdy. At one point in the evening, at what seemed to be a family establishment, a young man clad in lumberjack plaid whipped his cock out and danced to the Macarena.This place is the best BBQ place we have found out here! My husband and I both had the #4 combo plates so we could try their brisket, chicken and pork.  All of their meat was moist and just fell apart and melted in your mouth.  My husband had the cheese fries and I had the sweat potato fried...excellent! 

The little restaurant was clean and open, not crammed with tables and chairs taking up walking space.  They had a nice set up out side for seating as well. 

The girls working there were smiling, fun and helpful.  They actually seemed to enjoy their job (which I don't seem to run into much out here).

Bottom line we will become regulars for sure and we will be taking our friends and family there often!Incredible skillet, eggs made just right.  The potatoes were delicious and cheese melted just right. Highly recommended!This place is horribly good...Went here a few weeks ago, got the spicy, came home and had a few bloody marys with this greasy chicken.  I hardly ever eat fried chicken but this place most likely will change my mind.  i can appreciate other reviews about this place but i think that if a place is running out of stuff, i would think that its because it's so good, right? Workers there worked hard and were super nice.Delicious Veggie Lasanga accompanied by fresh seasoned Italian bread! It's hard to find good Italian food in Phoenix, but this spot just reminds me of my mom's pasta back in NY! Everything I've tried has been yummy: Roasted vegetable salad, Roasted vegetable sandwich, even their garden salad is always very fresh tasting and the balsamic dressing is premium. The servers and cooks are super nice too! I highly recommend you give this place a try & make returns because I have yet to try anything that wasn't spot on delicious.We gave this place 3 chances to hit a home run and they didn't even swing at the ball! Terrible service, bland food and the place was empty. We asked for a drink and the waitress acted annoyed! We will never go back.
I guess we have to travel all the way to Mesa for decent Chinese food.  Too bad.Love this joint! Very fresh and has gotten better every time! Huge pieces of poke and the kalbi too!! Very good prices too! Just a gem of a place... They could work on their customer service skills tho... And actually refill my drinks once or twice.. But overall very delicious food....Great food,  they have lot of varieties for lunch buffet and the cost is also very reasonable.Slow service. Esp after we stopped ordering drinks. Go to the hooters in the palms if you want to hit one up in vegas....

Food was warm and typical hooters food. Waitress didn't seem to care. 

Also do not stay at the hotel ...ever. it really is terrible!Food was great!  Price was great! Will return... it is missing one star because the waitress barely came to our table, we had to look for her.One of the best new places in Gilbert! The decor is sleek, clean, and modern looking. I've only tried one item here because I'm so in love with this dish but according to my family there are other delicious things too. My favorite thing is the chipotle BBQ brisket sandwich. It's delicious every time! 

My only criticism would be that the prices are a little too high. It's stopped us from going here on more than one occasion. But when we do decide it's worth it, we always have a great experience.Just had another amazing meal. Michael prepares wonderful combinations!! We celebrated my dad's birthday tonight and they made the evening extra special. If you want a special meal, Rusconi's is the place to go. Thank you Michael!!Had the Mista Salad & Bufala Dop pizza.  Excellent, fresh salad lightly dressed.  Was told cheese is made in house daily & used on Bufala Dop pizza which was light, favorful & creamy.  Excellent choice paired with wine.  Great evening.The food is super yummy, and the associates are very friendly. I will be back for sure!CFA is now in the same state where we reside--woohoo!
I know there are people who don't understand the long lines and the adoration, but that's alright.  We all have our favorite places to eat and, for me, Chick-Fil-A has a special place in my heart.  Growing up in Southern California, CFA was everywhere and it's easy to take it for granted until you move to a state that doesn't have one.  I just love the nuggets here because they're fresh and I can get a nice dose of protein at the same time.  Dip them into one or more of the sauces available and don't forget the waffle fries.  Customer service at any location we've visited has always been extremely friendly and this one is no exception.  You never have to leave your table for refills or throw away your trash because the staff is constantly walking around and checking on you.
We stopped by last night around 7:15pm (Thursday) and the lines for the drive-thru were long, but we were eating in.  Parking wasn't that difficult to find and the b\/f used the mobile app to place our order.  This was much faster as the line was out the door for those who were placing their orders inside.  We got our food in about ten minutes and were seated eating our food while others were still in line.  Moral of this story:  use the app to save time and EatMoreChikin faster.  
Welcome to Henderson, CFA!Typical diner atmosphere but food was very good! Service was great and speedy! It is cash only.I am SO SO SO happy this placed finally opened!!! I wasn't so sure about the Vig here, since I'll be honest and say I'm not a huge fan of the Arcadia one. But they have really exceeded my best expectations!  So much, that this has become my new fav Sunday spot! I casually went in a few Sundays back because I wanted to watch a World Cup game somewhere. I sat at the bar and was so impressed, I have found myself going back every Sunday since & will still continue, now that the games are over!  

I'll start with the service - I was actually surprised to see some negative reviews below on service, bc that's the main reason I keep returning.  But maybe I keep lucking out bc the same two female bartenders have worked each Sunday I've been.  I know I'm going to mutilate the spelling of their names on here, but Im going to go for it in hopes that others patrons that had bad experiences can look out for these 2 gems! Their names are Elyse & Malease (haha, simple to remember since they rhyme...just not so easy to spell lol). Anyway, they have given me superior service! I have a number of food allergies and Malease was not only pleasant & patient w\/me, but offered some great suggestions.  No matter how busy they are, they always keep an eye on our drinks & we never have to wait on refills.  They are also attentive with our meals, making sure everything comes out properly, we have all utensils & condiments, and simply just making sure we are completely satisfied. Malease even noted possible allergens in condiments for me!!! Unless you have allergies, you never really realize how valuable that is to someone.  And whenever things slowed a bit, they weren't your typical bartenders who ignore you and played on their phones, these ladies came over and were both so personal, sweet, and hilarious!  I think they do a really great job at reading people...when I wanted to focus on the games, they saw that and wouldn't interrupt. But if they saw my eyes wander or get bored, they were there to make me smile.  So kudos to this tag team!  They've made a regular outta me!

Ok, now the food - being that we have come for the past few Sundays, my bf and I have prob tasted at least half of the menu so far and I can't name one thing I haven't liked as of yet! Some of our favs so far are the corned beef & French toast for brunch and the fish tacos, salads, & the hot chick for lunch. If you have allergies, like me, let the staff know and they were more than happy to accommodate, which is rare.  And as for booze, you can't go wrong w\/bottomless Mimosas and they use Tito's (a fav) for their bloody bar! Delicious. 

So I absolutely recommend this place to everyone!  It's got it all...good food, great service, and perfect atmosphere!  And for those who had a bad experience, I saw give it another go...I'm sure they had some kinks in the beginning, which is totally normal. They def seem to have their rhythm down now...well, at least at the bar. I've never sat at a table, so I can't voice any suggestions towards that.Highlights\/lowlights

1) great\/authentic food
2) friendly service
3) more of a lunch place than a dinner place

El Poblano is a great place for a quick lunch! The food is very authentic, Mexican food. Friendly service, great salsa, and a Mexican bakery make this place great! 

The atmosphere is very casual, definitely more of a lunch stop than a dinner place. Free chips and salsa are provided and the servers are quick to refill chips when you run out! You can get a "Mexican Coke" in a glass bottle - delicious. The service is nice. Although it took awhile for someone to come over to us initially with the menus, once the servers knew we were there they were very friendly. Menu items include enchiladas, tacos, chile relleno etc. The food is great, really reasonably priced and the portions are generous.

Definitely consider EL Poblano if you are looking for a quick, authentic Mexican lunch!Famous Portuguese chicken done right.  The spices and sauce give the chicken a distinctive flavor and the fries are also delicious.  There's also some interesting (international) bottled beverages to choose from (whether cola or juices).  This place can get busy and often has a line but I think it's worth it for the rich flavorful chicken for a cheap and quick meal.My friends and I always meet up here when I am visiting from out of town. The service is usually mediocre but last night was absolutely terrible. One of my friends got there first and a soon a he sat down at the table in the bar area he was presented by the blonde female bartender with a $150.00 tab. He politely told the girl this wasn't his tab and she proceeded to literally scream at him and fly off the handle.  Luckily the tab owners had just stepped outside for a moment, but from that moment on we had the most terrible service from her. I ordered a margarita and it was disgusting with nothing but mixer and a few cubes of ice. The guys were ordering beers and they literally had to approach the bartender at the bar for two different rounds of beer because the bartender would not return to service our table like she was servicing the rest of them. We had to ask for menus because we were not offered any and anytime we attempted to speak with or get the bar tender's attention she just glared and smirked and acted like everything was just a big inconvenience to her. She was literally snatching money out of out hands while we were paying. Ridiculous.Absolutely amazing food and drinks. The best sangria I have ever had. However the service is a hit or miss depending if you go on a week day versus the weekend.We have gone here for years, and make the trip even after we moved further away.  The staff and food are great!   They make us Sesame Beef even though it is not on the menu - yum!I love Dim Sum! I consider my self a dim sum master! And this place is a dim sum equivalent of fireworks. This place was so fresh tasting, nothing was over steamed or I've cooked. The pork bun and shrimp dumplings were probably eh best inhale ever tasted. The sticky rice was light fluffy and delicious.  The chicken noodle garlic soup was probably the best soup I have ever tasted. Easy five star reco!!!About the same as other locations.  You get what you expect.  it is fast food but good.  The do have a value menu and there are coupons in the entertainment books.  The fries and the frosty are good.Absolutely loved this place! Adjacent to the Wigwam resort. Super convenient, walked about 50 paces out of our room and was there at restaurant. My Son, who's a bean aficionado loved the beans and salsa. I had the Carne Asada burrito and was very satisfied. My only regret was we didn't discover this place till the last day of our vacation.This place is awesome! I had great service and the food was wonderful.  Their wok dishes are to die for. David and Vegas were great. They gudied me through the menu and had great suggestions.  I would definitely come back and recommend this place to all my friends!Pull everyone forward in the drive through and make them wait on their food.  Sitting here with three cats right now and non other vehicles in the drive thru.  I'm guessing to keep their stats up? Or avoid people passing by when they see a long line.  They have no business in the store leaving me to wonder what takes so long for them to fill orders.  Poorly run.Very very impressed. Small plate menu, but they offer coursed out meals, that the chef will create for you. We had an amazing experience. make sure you save room for the bread pudding. We'll definitely be back.Always great, come here a few times a year and never sorry.  Prices are low and quality is there.  Come here.Terrible experience here. Vegetarian options were limited & the restaurant said they could not accommodate us much. The bread also had eggs. Due to the poor service, we walked out. I expect much better care and service at a high end restaurant, and this restaurant failed.Hadn't been to Outback Steakhouse in a few years. Tonight was the worst dining experience we've had in a while.  The steaks (both 6 oz filets) were ordered medium rare and delivered well done (no pink).  The tortilla soup was delivered with no cheese and NO tortillas. They did bring a replacement soup and did provide a $10 credit on a return visit (which someone can have because we won't be back). Final note, the service was very slow.The Chicken Tikka Platter at lunch is delicious!  I've eaten here several times for lunch and am never disappointed.  The flavors from every dish are amazing!  The staff is very nice although service can be slow when busy.  Definitely give Sahara a try!This time I went by the drive thru and always AAA in customer service. Trinity, took our order in such a pleasant way you feel welcomed to go again and again.Only bad thing, It was nighttime and the menu boards at the drive thru had no lights and it was difficult to read the menu and the whole place in the back is dark. They need lighting in the drive thru for security. Food is always great.I was SOOOOOOO disappointed to see Max Brenner-Caesar's had closed. By far, the BEST chocolate martini EVER. I'd been talking it up since my last visit, with pictures!!!!! Sad to see you go. :-(Ate here with my girlfriends. The servers were very accommodating. The dynamite sushi was great because they had big pieces of scallops. The calamari were slightly bigger in size than what we anticipated which was great. The drinks weren't that spectacular unfortunately. But overall it was a good experience.The best Shawarma in Ontario. affordable prices, clean, friendly and delicious.3.75\/5

I had the Cracked Catfish and grits. I really enjoyed them both. Was a good batter on the fish and the grits were creamy and went well with the fish.

My wife had a shrimp po'boy. While it wasn't as good as New Orleans, it's hard to find a po'boy in Toronto.

We also had sweet potato fries that seemed a bit under done.

Our meal came with 3 sauces: a tartar sauce, ginger remoulade, and a spicy mayo. All pretty good.I'm still angry that they moved further away from me and now that they are in the mall it's too crowded.  Aside from this, I do like chompies' bagels and cookies.  Actually, I love their cookies.  They are soooo yummy.  If you are in the mall and just want dessert, order some cookies and take them out somewhere to sit in the mall.  I don't have patience to sit in a overly crowded mall resteraunt so they lost my sit down and eat business with their location change.Great place for burritos, quesadillas or salad. Go here instead of Chipotle. Staff is always very friendly and hard working. I eat here at least once per week. My only beef is paying $7 for a cheese quesadillas but it is delicious so worth the price.Yum!  I have been here a few times for take-out and have been happy with my meal every time.  So far, I have tried the Thai Tofu, the Spicy Tofu and the Honey Tofu.  This is my new favorite Chinese take-out joint.The food was delish with a great atmosphere.  I like the rustic look and try the cucumber mint refresher, amazingSeeing that there is always lines on the weekends for a decent breakfast place, I am surprised more businesses don't fill that need. I was thrilled when Biscuits Café opened as a close by option for weekend breakfast. I really like the staff. The servers and hostess have always been welcoming and helpful. The only thing that needs improvement is the cooks. Even the servers got frustrated with them and said they kept making the same mistakes over and over again. Despite that, the food is good, they give lots of it, too much actually, and I like the ambience.During a 4-day stint in Vegas my friends and I found ourselves here EVERY night, lol. Why? Well, it's got good cheap eats, cheap gambling, and free karaoke--are you sensing a pattern here? I ate two meals here and both were solid: chicken fried steak on one occasion and the fish & chips on another. VERY generous portions and stick-to-your ribs good. Another good option if you get before before midnight is the pizza; as with everything else in this place, it's cheap and good. And the $2 beer! It's the kind of Vegas value you don't see very often anymore. I'm definitely a fan and I believe it'll have to be a stop every time I find myself in Vegas. Apparently they take the Ellis Island motto of "Give Me Your Tired, Your Poor, Your Huddled Masses" to heart!I'd read some reviews of Stephano's before but never really had it on my list. I was going to cruise up Eastern to Silverado Ranch or Richmar for lunch today, but since I was in the very immediate vicinity of this place, I popped inside to look at the menu. Noting that the various pita wraps are mostly priced at $6.95, I went for the beef and lamb gyro on a wheat pita and used the Yelp check-in for a free baklava (normally $0.99).

The wheat is perhaps the first thing you'll notice when you take a bite. It's a bit of a sweet taste and different from a regular pita, and it has a pre-made feel. Some may not like it, but I didn't mind too much. Then you'll realize that there's a very generous amount of meat, up to six slices of not-so-thin gyro meat in my wrap. I was pleased since I honestly didn't expect that much meat. The tzatziki sauce isn't as special, but it's vital for the creaminess and bit of sourness. Tomatoes and onions complete the experience with some texture and acidity. I thought that the overall flavor profile was balanced and tasty, but not especially daring with the spices. It's a safe gyro choice and a solid lunch portion.

The baklava is a fairly small triangle. It's a very honey-ful pastry of phyllo layers with pistachio, and it's advertised as being made from scratch daily. Perhaps that's what gave it the softness that I don't normally get from baklava. I'd say that the baklava is definitely above average as far as these things go.

I probably won't be drawn back here very often due to its remoteness from me, along with the presence of other Greek places nearer to my neighborhood, but I think it's worth a shot if you're in the area. Grab a couple of wraps or a plate-sized portion of whatever appeals to you.Ordered a meatball sub and a pepperoni pizza. Both were really good. I specially enjoyed the meatball sub the sauce was spicy but not hot or too sweet.Don't get me wrong I actually enjoy the Subway franchise, but recently I went here for a sub and a few hours after I ate and had gone to bed, I woke up and started violently vomiting. Turns out I got food poisoning. Now let me tell you why I think it was Subway, I hadn't had anything else besides a bagel earlier that day for breakfast and I ate there at 2am, which is another thing the food had probably been sitting out for a few hours and silly me HAD to get double meat. I find it kind of humorous that Subway's slogan is "Eat Fresh", and this particular Subway obviously doesn't represent that slogan in a very positive light.Really great service, nice clean restaurant.  The food was well prepared and came out in a timely manner.  Portions were smaller than I expected but the flavor was good!I've been here about 5 times already.They're customer service is really great. The blonde girl who works in the front is very sweet. They obviously have potential so I keep coming back for more they disappoint me every time. The food is okay but sometimes terrible. Their falafel is extremely dry, I've ordered it three times. Their wraps are never the same and always lacking. I just ordered a hummus veggie pita and their are no cucumbers and pretty much no toppings just the hummus. I ordered 2 and both were different proportions. The falafel pita from Mike's Kitchen is way better and is actually full of food.Another tucked away little secret located in the Campus Commons building. 

As a regular to both Kaba Curry and Wing King i've asked several times about the 'mexican joint' as we call it as well as the 'italian joint' next to Jefe's. Usually i miss both of them as i tend to come in the late afternoon and early evenings and they pack up after the lunch crowds. So when i decided to stop by early for once Jefe's was open and i got a chance to try it out.

The daily special sounded good. 3 home made pork tamales and home made horchata as a drink. What sat at a table near by their spot was this
http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/lOmt6Edj6A4OZBUIUwtI8Q?select=5AdeMTWWFlH3GUyC0qLRPg#d468-qcU6StyNYsLehx24Q

I was pretty damn impressed with what i saw and the horchata was HUGE.

First bite was the best. The end piece was crispy and really hard but the cheese melted and hardened and all the flavors concentrated. After a few more chews i realized that holy crap this is the best tamale i've ever had thanks to the end pieces. The owner came out to ask how everything was and i asked him about it. They fried up the tamales on the griddle or something to warm them up and a result of it is the crispy ends. 

Aside from the lovely end pieces the tamales were very good quite possibly the best i've had, then again i havent had a lot of tamales and i prefer enchiladas. What ever...moving on. 

Good seasonings, perfect balance of meat and cheese and the sauce and mayo they added on top create a harmony of flavors.

They plan on staying open later starting in a few weeks so hopefully i found a replacement for Roberto's.Definitely not an authentic dim sum restaurant but it's in the casino and it's convenient. The food was ok. Not bad. Not great. On the pricier side since its in the casino.  The basic fried dim sum dishes were good. The roti with curry wasn't great. Spicy fried rice wasn't very good and the Chinese veggies were overcooked.  The service was on the slow side but polite and the decor was nice.Lenny's Sub Shop is a clone of Jersey Mike's.  So if you like Jersey Mike's, you'll probably like Lenny's.  In my opinion their subs are better because the meat is sliced fresh.  The staff here is very friendly and they aim to please.  The price is the same as most other sub shops.Good airport food. Chicken wraps are good a little to much onion. Kobe sliders very good.I would recommend this place we honestly keep going back. I like the birria and carne asada tacos as well as the carne asada fries.mmmmmmmmmmmmm.  Small.  Always lined up and for good reason.  Great food.  Great prices.  I need say no more.Friendly service. Staff did not rush me to order as I waited for my boyfriend to show up (and he was laaaaaate) even though the restaurant was getting packed. Both drinks ordered cojo and something else were delicious. Also tried the Thai fried rice and beef noodles soup. Very flavourful and generous portions. Would come back another time and try their other items.I'm giving it 2 stars and that is only because of the food. The food is honestly awesome. I have had burritos, the americano style tacos, and more. All tasted great. The service on the other hand is very poor. I have beem here 3 times in the past 8 months and every time my wife and I have received horrible service. Last night was my most recent trip and the gentleman working the register was rude just like everyone else I've encountered. My favorite part is the delicious salsa bar they offer, but if you request one of the larger tubs from stack of 100 behind the counter. Every person we've asked acts like we are asking for golden covered little bowls from heaven. I even had one employee tell me, after I just spent $50 on food for my entire 6 person family, which included 2 large orders of chips. That we could only have one salsa container. So again and in short, great food horrible service. It's to bad because I work in a customer service and hold it to high standards. So for this reason, after last night, we will never return.Not sure if we would go back. It was ok...not great but not bad. Cute place, fun tables, chairs and decorations. 
Food: I had the 3 taco plate Al Pastor with rice and beans.
My man had 3 different tacos, carne asada, brisket and the taco guara (sp). It was a taco in a flour shell. 
We shared the Carne Asada fries.
The soda machine was out so we had mexican cokes which I LOVE. 
The fries were delicious, but the Carne Asada was extremely seasoned...a little too much, overwhelming flavor. 
My al pastor tacos were good, not great.  The rice was delicious and the beans were not fully cooked.  
My man's tacos were ok he said...when he says ok I know he's not happy. Although the brisket one he really liked!
I just don't know if we would go back!I've never had so much sushi in one bowl and so many options! This is my new favorite place I love itHas won "Best of the west" multiple times. Most of the staff has been here a long time so there is a "neighborhood" feel to Mojos that you don't often get at the chain places. Most of the staff know exactly what the regulars like whether it is to make their coffee extra hot or maybe a tad less hot or when making a sandwich knowing exactly how the customer likes them to make it.  They also have a rewards (frequent coffee drinker) program so if you are new make sure to ask for a card.Excellent fresh and well presented well also. Friendly and caring owners that are will to go the extra mile in giving you an outstanding experience.It's nice to have a more upscale casino in the city that caters to locals.  Very clean place with a good buffet.  Throw in a bowling alley, multiple dining options, and decent slots, and it's a hit.  As with every casino in the city, the amount of smoke is ridiculous.i love this place, the girls always remember my smoothie and are always pleasant they ran out of splenda today and i left and walked next door and bought them a big ass thing of splenda so they wouldn't run into that problem for the day, they were so kind and grateful, my fav place :)This hotel is one of the better lower end hotels on the Strip.  For the price you can potentially pay (really cheap with plenty of online offers), it's well worth it.

Driving up and down the strip can be quite a nightmare, luckily the parking lot for TI is right off the 15.  There is no need to deal with any of that annoying car and foot traffic.  Furthermore, you can side street it to any of the hotels on the west side of the Strip again with no traffic or hassle at all via Industrial and Frank Sinatra (easily accessible roads from the TI parking lot).

The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful.  They were even helpful over the phone when I had to call down to have the free wifi fixed for our room.

The hotel itself is in good condition.  Still very clean and looks well kept.  It doesn't have the dingy looking carpet or cracked paint on the walls that you might see at other hotels.  But of course it doesn't even look nearly as nice as the Cosmopolitan or Bellagio either.  Elevators, hallways, rooms, all clean and very well decorated.  Did not have any issues with the room at all; open space in the room and a very large bathroom.  There are also floor to ceiling windows that give you an amazing view of the strip.

Gaming is typical, decent amount of tables and ample slot machines.  Guiley's pit which is new I guess even has some of the scantily clad females of the Guiley's bar that act as dealers.  

Overall, I very much enjoyed my stay at TI.  I've been to the hotel on several occasions and never really have any complaints.  I still have yet to see the Sirens show out front though!  Maybe next time...This rates as a hidden treasure.  I love the big windows, the vintage fixtures, marble bar, and mottled paint and plaster walls.  I almost always go for whatever breakfast pizza is being offered.  The cappuccino is excellent as well.  I hope this place lasts forever.After reading the reviews, went to Reyna today to check out the fabled tacos.  The were all that was promised and more.  Everything was super fresh, and the cilantro and lime make it special.  Really a treat.We absolutely love this concept. Having been to their location at Tatum and Cactus several times we decided to try this one out last night for dinner. The bruschetta was as great as always and the barbecue chicken pizza was fantastic. What was truly memorable though was the service, topnotch in a pizza joint. You don't find that every day.Found this place on yelp.  It has a hip vibe and was very crowded at 1 pm on a Saturday afternoon.  Music was annoyingly loud, but we were among the older patrons.  

Following our server's advice, I ordered the pork adobada and carne Asada tacos.  DH ordered those two plus the crispy fish taco.  It took an extremely long time for our plates to arrive.  No employee bothered to tell us our food would eventually arrive.  They give you chips and salsa as soon as you sit.  Salsa looked good but was boring with no distinct flavor.  DH said his meal was perfect.

Unfortunately mine was not. I was given the Adobada and another taco. I asked my husband if the second taco looked like his fish taco and he said no.  I am super careful because I can get anaphylaxsis from cod or snapper.  

I looked for a server, any server, but could not get anyone's attention for a few minutes.   After staring at it I finally bit into a tiny corner of the taco.  It was definitely fish. No anaphylaxis, but a slight itchy allergic reaction.

It took a few more minutes of waving my arm to attract the attention of a server who took the dish away. Finally, our server came over since I had no food.  We  told her I was given a fish taco. She knew I ordered the pork and beef tacos.  She said she would check on my replacement plate

The new plate came with no apology and the tacos were great. They each had a unique flavor with a nice balanced, yet interesting mix of spices. 

It's very sad that neither server expressed concern over the mix up.  People who do not have serious allergies often do not understand that they can kill someone by serving the wrong food.  I stop breathing if I eat certain fish or peanuts.

No offer to do anything except bring me what I ordered after my husband finished his tacos.  Also, the menu said one free side order if you order three tacos.  The server did not mention that to DH.

Then, when the waitress brought our change she shortchanged my husband. He tipped her, but maybe should have skipped the tip so she might realize the service was very poor.

No stars for service and 5 stars for food. If I lived in Phoenix I would probably eat here because the food is that good.  I think they probably have other servers who care more about doing a good job.  However, I haven't tried other Phoenix restaurants of this genre so maybe there are better ones.Went last weekend and really enjoyed it. I had the breakfast pizza and was not let down. I also had the salad with blue cheese and walnuts. I will say that the salad was incredible.  I will get that every time I go.
The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that the crust is a little thin for my taste and the wine list was a little small....me just being picky. Will return for sure!Very salty and seemed as if it was prepared from a crockpot.  Never see any smoke come from the place - how do you BBQ in a strip mall?   Hmmm.Purchased a Groupon to try them out. We didn't know what to order. The employees were super nice and even gave us a couple of extra treats to try out. The cinnamon rolls were great. Nice selection of fresh things to put on top. The best part- We didn't feel all heavy and stuffed after only eating half. We will be back.Pretty good spot to grab a bite if you're up in the Downtown Summerlin mall area!

Like Wolfgang's other places, this restaurant is consistent and also offers of good selection of tasty delights.  

For my drink, I had the daily healthy fresh pressed juice.  Today's special was spinach, kale, celery, ginger, orange, and apple.  It's not bad combo and tasted alright.

For the appetizer we had the calamari, roasted vegetable pizza, and a side of french fries.  The calamari was awesome, two sauces for you to dip your calamari and some battered veggies as well.  The roasted pizza was very good as well, the broccolini added a nice texture to the pizza.  Normally I like a meaty type of pizza, but for a change I decided to try the roasted vegetable pizza and I'm glad I did.  Nothing special about the fries, skinny type fries, but the nice thing is the side of fries is a nice hearty portion and great for sharing.

For dinner we had the mushroom pasta and a side of broccolini.  The mushroom pasta had great flavor, but the one thing I wasn't a fan of was some of the pasta had clumps of salt which made it really salty for some bites.  The brocolini stir fry side was a nice compliment to the meal, a little subtle spicy kick to it.  

As for dessert, we had the apple crotada.  Basically, a fresh baked open faced apple pastry with a side of vanilla ice cream.  Since it's fresh baked, it takes a few minutes longer.  This was really good, the pastry was very flaky and warm right out of the oven.  The apples weren't too sweet and a little tart which I like.  Definitely a dessert I'd get again.

Service at the table was pretty good.  The odd thing is with the hostess, we got there and had to sit at the community table since we didn't make a reservation per the hostess even though 80% of the restaurant wasn't full at that time.  Even after we were done with our meal, paid and got up to leave the main dining area they had about 40% of the main dining area open not counting the outside patio dining area that no one really sat at since it's cold outside.  It seemed odd to push people to the community table to sit next to each other when it wasn't super busy.  Maybe the hostess was still training, but I'd recommend making a reservation given our experience if you and your party want a more private dining experience.Would not eat here again! 

I came here at the recommendation of a friend who said this place was better than Messini's. Boy was she wrong! 

This place does look much cleaner than Messini's but the food was awful. I wouldn't even eat here if I was completely wasted, starving, and nothing else was open. 

The food was crap. The service was crap. The prices seemed higher than Messini's as well. 

The only reason why I give it a 1 star is because they have a little patio. 

If you are hungry stick to Messini's--although the customer service sucks at Messini's, the food is reliable and good.After reading all the reviews on here I was very excited to give Pomo a try.  So, last night, my wife and I and another couple went at about 7pm.  The place was pretty packed so it was a good thing we had a reservation.  The decor is pretty hip and had a good vibe to it.  The place's crowd seemed to be the stereotypical older Scottsdale folk.  I was expecting a younger crowd for some reason though as it is a pizza joint.

I can't understand all the hype about this place.  Especially all the 5 start reviews on here.  Maybe this place deserves 5 stars for having authentically made pizzas.  However, being authentic doesn't automatically translate into "the best pizza in AZ".  I'm not going to argue with the throngs of Yelpers on here who know good Italian pizza, but I've been to Naples and don't remember a single pizza that I ate being soggy.  Pomo's pizza is pretty good with the crust having a good flavor to it, not too crunchy and not too chewy - BUT it was soggy (especially towards the middle).  Also, I won't argue that the ingredients and toppings are all of the highest quality and flown in daily from the far reaches of the earth - but I believe that for the most part a tomato is a tomato and cheese is cheese.  It is all how you combine and prepare the ingredients that makes something really special.  $15 for a small pizza I would expect a more generous helping of toppings (if only the crust could support it) and not have 1 or 2 slices with absolutely nothing on them but sauce.

Anyway, we ordered the Margherita, Pomo and the Donna Rosa pizzas.  They came out relatively quickly and weren't scalding hot which was good.  The 3 pizzas was more than enough for 4 people to share so that was also good.  The Pomo was my favorite.  I loved the toppings.  I just wish the sauce had more flavor and the crust was a bit more sturdy.  All I can say is that their pizzas are pretty good but nothing special.

The salads didn't fare much better in my opinion.  The Caesar and the Pollo were only ok and pretty small.  I was expecting a bigger, more shareable salad for 10 bucks.  The tiramisu, however, was homemade and excellent.  It was a big enough piece for 4 of us to share.  I would definitely order it again.

This place has TONS of waiters, waitresses, bussers, servers, etc. bustling around and they all looked pretty friendly and attentive as was the case with our waitress.  She was very friendly, fast and helpful.

Pro Tip #1 - Get a $40 certificate for $20 on Local Dines, http:\/\/bit.ly\/dfR4eQ, no restrictions and works just like a normal gift certificate.

Pro Tip #2 - Make a reservation.  This seems to be a hot spot for now so make a reservation or be prepared to wait during peak times.Awful!!! 
Kitchen is very dirty,owner is Chinese and French I think he has the worst attitude I have ever see.
Coffee was super cold and probably made 5 hours ago,the OWNER TOUCH THE FOOD WITH HIS HANDS!!!! Where is the health dep??!!!!
And also I asked him what's the code for the wifi he gets mad and says no code no internet!! 
Chocolate  croissant was similar to starbucks (when they had it) nothing really authentic here!!Ah, yes! So glad we took up the opportunity to try this place again. They didn't disappoint and the philly special was delicious!! We will definitely be back.Items Selected:

Having recently returned from a Lone Star State tour of smoked meat Meccas ranging from Black's and Snow's to Pecan Lodge and Franklin it was with modest expectations but high hopes that I approached Rollin Smoke, a space many locals and critics have hailed as the best barbeque in Las Vegas, and opting to explore the menu through a generous $24.99 all-you-can eat program I must say I walked away a (very full) believer.  Located on South Highland where outdoor smokers and burning hickory alert the senses to something more than industrial surroundings Rollin Smoke is as small and homey as many a' Texas or Kansas City 'cue spots and staffed by Razorback pitmaster Trey Holland plus a dedicated team of enthusiasts the service is every bit on par with that down south - a true love of the art noted in lengthy answers to questions about woods, temperatures, and process while simultaneously making sure every guest is content.  Featuring a diverse menu with spices and rubs harkening the style of BBQ found across the south but a bit more aggressively sweet than that in Texas it was with a trio of smoked meats, two must-order sides, and buttery cornbread that I began and although brisket was a bit drier than I'd prefer the smoke was prominent and flavor was on point - a trend extending to fatty ribs and supple pulled pork that lacked not for juices, the latter falling just short of KC's Oklahoma Joe's reference standard.  Still nibbling at the creamy corn nuggets as plate two arrived it was here that I sampled Holland's two most raved items and with a blackened caramelized crust overlying tender flesh and melted collagen the beef rib wowed just as much as the signature meatloaf, absolutely rife with hickory notes and light heat amidst a delicately packed beef.  Ignoring decent but mundane chicken and mac n' cheese I found inedibly bland compared to the rich potatoes and previous fried sides it was with a duo of desserts that I rounded out the tasting and suffice it to say that while banana pudding tastes straight from a box the focus should instead be directed to the cobbler, a bubbling bowl of soft peaches with buttery pie crust crowned with Texas' own Blue Bell vanilla - a perfect end to a pretty damned good meal by any standard.I had the classic cheeseburger and it was amazing, probably one of the best cheeseburgers I've ever had. I could tell the meat was fresh and it had a lot of flavor. The bun is so soft and buttery. The fries were great too and I loved the dipping sauce, not sure what it is, but maybe Ozzy's sauce. My only complaints are they forgot the pickles (one of the key items for me) and they advertise a $7.99 combo on a board outside. It doesn't say Monday-Friday, just 11am to 6pm, but apparently that doesn't apply at 3pm on a Saturday. Anyway I'll definitely be back for more burgers.This is the Best Chinese food in Vegas. Every time I go I am amazed at how often take it is. They don't speak a lot of English but their food is fantastic.Best burger ever!!!!! Best frozen custard ever! Best shake ever!!!!! 
If you didn't get the gist of where I was headed, I loved this burger joint!!!!! I highly recommend checking this place out. The burgers were very fresh and non-greasy. It was oozing with goodness and plenty of flavor. It's easily visible that the beef is quality. The fries left me wanting more since I didn't need a napkin to wipe off excess grease or oil. The frozen custard was a happy ending to a wonderful meal. The texture was smooth and creamy. I had the flavor of the week which was the salted caramel. My fav!!!!! 
Burger lovers check this place out!henry's is a beautiful restaurant with very attentive staff.  We had a reservation for 8.  When we got their the table ahead of us was running late.  We had a drink at the bar and soon we were seated.  Our waiter, Ed, was able to get them to go to the bar so we could get our table.  Ed was very helpful, as I am not an expert in southern low-country cuisine.  My husband went with the Kobe beef- the sweet potatoes that came on the side were delicious.  I had shellfish boil  with rice,  sausage  peppars and onions that was cooked to perfection and a cup of crab soup that had a nice kick to it!~
Everything looked and tasted devine!
It is hard to see off of Detroit road, unless you know what you are looking for.The flights are really fun since they have such an awesome selection of beers!  The decor fits the place great.  Knowledgeable bartenders can give you advice on beer selections and the food was delicious too.Ok, so it's a Mexican restaurant next to a gentlemen's club. How can that be wrong? Food is great, service is good. Only quibble would be the ambiance. Room is too dark to a fault, making it difficult to see your dinner guests.If this place could be described in four words, they would be:

Angry, Sweaty, Dive-y, and DELICIOUS

This place is a Pittsburgh classic. Don't go here if your looking for some hip and trendy seafood joint. I'm pretty sure the decor hasn't changed in the past 50 years, but that's part of what makes it awesome.

The cashiers and cooks are angry, and slightly scary looking, but not in a bad way (if that makes any sense whatsoever). Their no-nonsense, "soup-nazi" style fits with the classic blue-collar Pittsburgh motif this place is still holding on to. If you go in knowing what you want, you'll be fine.

Bottom line, and most importantly, the food. Pretty much everything is fried, but it's all good. Never too greasy, and only lightly breaded. When lent rolls around, you always see every restaurant in town with signs boasting, "Voted Best Fish in Town." I'm not sure who's voting, and how EVERY restaurant seems to have the best. Don't be fooled, Oyster House IS the best fried fish in town.The food was ok. The service was terrible and the food was not served in the order you would expect.,Had to ask for silverware, water,  and rice Do you enjoy eating from dishes that are chipped-not just one but most of them.  How unsanitary!! Asked for unchipped dishes and were told they didn't have any.
The food might be good but not that much better so will not go there again. Terribly disappointed!Great atmosphere, great music, and good food. Live band preforming salsa music and dancefloor open for salsa dancingThis place has some of the worst service you will ever encounter. The very first time I went to this place I was told to take a seat anywhere I would like and they would be right with me. I sat down and waited for 20 minutes to not even being given a menu. I walked out and told myself I would never go again. Well, yesterday a friend of mine told me to go here with him and I have them a second chance. When I got there the waitress sat us down didn't have the order I wanted so I ordered another order and then waited 40 minutes for my food while there was only 3 other people sitting down. Here is the worst part though. The waitress that served me couldn't feel my water up because she was too busy at the bar sitting down talking to a bartender rather then helping customers. After eating it took us so long to even get a check that I got up to ask a cook if I can just pay him. Around the corner comes two of the employees who were sitting at a table talking to each other to finally come around and give me my check. This place is the most unprofessional resteraunt in all of Las Vegas. I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy! If you like terrible service and mediocre food then this is your place!This is the best DD ever!!!  I come in here before I head over to work sometimes and the staff is sooooooo friendly!!  I bought a small coffee, and the worker gave me an ice water to-go along with the coffee; I didn't even have to ask him for water!  The manager even spoke with me briefly before I left.  Some places rush their customers out, but the workers will talk to you and treat you well here!  Thanks for treating your customers like royalty, DD!  :)No one took care of guests who were standing in the waiting line for 10 min. at midnight. 3 guests including my group gave up waiting and left. The most insulting part was the waiters made no attempt to seat us even though they saw us.Although I love the Bagels,bread,pastries,etc. I also go here for sandwiches. Initially I was stuck on the "Jacked-up Turkey " which is delicious! Chicken parm is great as well. Today I got the Cheesesteak, I didn't know what to applaud more the baguette or the steak! Since the bread is already famous,let's talk about the beef! The steak was lean,tender & well-flavored. My only gripe was the size,but the taste and affordable price made up for it.Best delivery pizza I've had! Great customer service, and food shows up quickly. Always great quality, hot, fresh and so flavorful. It's definitely not your average greasy, bland, soggy delivery pizza. 10\/10The food was mediocre. I got the Portabella mushroom burger which was pretty good as well as the BBQ Bacon burger which wasn't bad but also wasn't satisfying. The food wasn't bad but it also didn't leave an impression on me afterwards whatsoever. I got the tempura green beans to go and when I got home I had to put my own seasoning on them because they were very bland. Worth the stop if you are passing by, however not a place I would go out of my way for.5 years ago when I lived in this area I love the Montana Meat Company.  Sadly, that has changed.  I have dined there twice within the last month and it seems everything has gone south.  Food quality, food portions, service, speed, friendliness... all have grossly deteriorated.  Montana Meat Company is now on my personal list of "never again's", which is not an easy task to accomplish.  If you are in the area and looking for a decent steak there are few options, other than Giuseppe's on the weekends or the Summerlin venues which are a bit further of a drive.The meat was descent I actually enjoyed the beef. The chicken not so much. Didnt like how they had the sides layed out upon arrival n didnt pick them up when they seen we put it to the side n didnt touch it.Food came out fast..No line which I thought it would be at 10pm on a Saturday night. $20 for all you eat, not bad. Great place for a date. The place is lit up nice. You should try it for yourself.My boyfriend loves coming here. I'm not personally a curry fan but I love the atmosphere and my hunny and son love the food. So I come along for sit down. Always clean and always so kind. Love coming here. Hides restaurant is beautiful.For a really basic hotel, this place was great. I'm surprised by all the bad reviews. Everything was clean, functional, and the front desk staff was friendly and helpful. I don't expect a lot renting a room in Vegas, usually they all smell like smoke and feel dingy. But the Royal was surprisingly clean and quite comfortable.

I would definitely stay here again.I don't know how this place is more expensive than the Bellagio. The Bellagio is the standard the standard for buffets around the world this place has no flavor they had oysters that they were running water on top of taking all the juices from the oysters the juice from the oysters were just being washed away by the water. Tiny cocktail shrimp not even one bits worth and for $56 a person to eat in this place I don't know how they get away with it when the Bellagio is only $40 a person don't waste your money don't waste your time complete failure waste of a hundred-million-dollar renovation. And this is after I gave them a second chance the first time was exactly the same but I didn't see them running the oysters underwater or I would have never stayed the first timeVery much enjoyed this place, quick and friendly service. I ordered the veal and eggplant godfather sandwich. It's huge and a total happy place for carb loving foodies. Choose how spicy you want it and if you want onions. 
Many other options I want to try next time, the chicken looked good too. 
This is a large lunch in one sandwich.I made a reservation on a Monday evening and was seated very quickly upon arrival. 

My friend and I got seated in a dark corner, and the table was wobbly. But we didn't want to let that affect our meal. 

Started off with a fresh baguette with a radish spread, which was pretty good. We both ordered the hanger steak medium rare. My friend's steak wasn't cooked correctly on some parts of the steak, however, mine was great. It came with pomme frites. It was a different type of fries...reminded me of fritos but less crunchy and more potato-y. 

Overall, I felt that I was very satisfied with my meal and the price of the meal.seriously overpriced IMO but there was enough takers for the dinner meal to cause a 45 minute wait on a Wednesday. quality of food was very good but for the price paid I would expect more of a selection.Absolutely scrumptious! One of my co-worker recommended this place to me several months ago.. and I finally got around to dining here! I love the atmosphere- family photos adorn the walls, fine, white clothes and tableware set the tables. The wine barrel semi-wall is really neat. The restaurant is segregated into various areas, such as the pizza bar with someone stretching and throwing dough in front of you, high tables, low tables and a wine cellar area. 

Now to the food- 
I started with the fresh mozzarella, tomatoes and basil- fresh and delicious. 
Pasta Primavera with cream sauce- angel hair pasta with fresh veggies cooked to perfection and tenderness with nicely seasoned creamy sauce. Oh my goodness, I will be returning! So worth it. 
I believe my friend ordered the Penne Alla Vodka, which wasn't anything spectacular. We tried each other's entrees and she loved mine. 

Next time I visit, i'll try and save room for dessert. 

Staff was welcoming and friendly.My absolute favorite thing about this place is the menu. Every item is named after something movie related. Movie lines, characters, etc. I love it.

The location is a little confusing. It is on the back side of the building on 715 Providence. So if you park out front (where you'll see Toccare and Stagioni), walk around to the back of the building. You'll see the big patio and also a parking lot there. 

So, let's start with that big 'ole patio. I cannot wait until it warms up outside. It looks like a great place to hang out and to have drinks.

This is not one of those restaurants where you sit down and a server automatically brings you chips and salsa. If you want them, you have to order and pay for them. Instead of salsa, I order the Billy Ray Valentine. It's like cheese dip on steroids.... a queso with chorizo, corn relish and pico. I usually get two tacos and a side of the creamy white beans. Tacos range from $3.50-$4 and you can add a side for $2. So if you go the taco route, you'll spend about $10 for your meal. So far I've had: "I'll Have What She's Having" (grilled mahi-mahi), "Uncle Buck" (fried oysters) and "Fat Guy In A Little Coat" (grilled skirt steak). I've liked them all so far. 

I haven't had anything from the cocktail list yet. I'm excited to try their version of a spicy margarita. Last night, they had $5 white sangria on special. I'm not the biggest sangria person, but hey when in Rome right? Or should I say Mexico?

The staff have all been nice. Service has been a little hit or miss. I think they're still feeling things out since they are fairly new.Ok Habit Burger makes a unique Tasty Burger so Simply put ....it's difficult to Compare to In and out ...Quick note you must tell them to put Onion on Burger....I just said with everything and no Onion was result....Fries are fresh and crispy....burgers are charbroiled which adds a smokey flavor quite different from In N out....Overall good QualityI don't normally post rants.... but this place is f***ing filthy.  FILTH.  EVERYWHERE.  It seriously looks like someone had a food fight in here, and I'm not sure they should even be serving food legally.  Every piece of upholstery is torn, every table is dirty, and there's trash everywhere.  Hey owner... how about you take at least 2% responsibility for your establishment?  Maybe it's Popeye's fault, but you should probably hold yourself to a higher standard than Popeye's.Reported by several customers one including March 30, 2018 that they re-serve left over side dishes!This little bar\/pub was amazing!! I went with my sister for a birthday lunch and she is quite a picky person when it comes to food and experience. We had an amazing experience throughout our entire time there. So if she had a great time, then it was good!! The food was soooo good! I had the mushroom burger and the beef and mushrooms were seasoned to perfection! A MUST TRY IS THE TRUFFLE FRIES!!!! Their regular fries are amazing as well, but the truffle fries were that extra mile! When it comes to fries, I am all about the texture and these were the best I've ever had! We went in around 1pm on a Tuesday and were the only patrons. The waitress said that it gets busier during the evening so if you want to avoid the crowd, I suggest going during a late afternoon. Also we tried their smoke wood old fashioned and it was great. You can still smell the delicious smoke in he drink. I also had their rosé which was very good as well. Overall, despite it being on the strip, it was an excellent choice for lunch. We will definitely return! The inside dining is very small with one table able to accommodate a small group (5-7), but they have patio seating as well with regular sized tables. The staff is very kind and will interact with you to make you feel comfortable and relaxed! Definitely give this place a try!Monday is Margherita pizza day!!  $5!!!  The pizza is absolutely incredible. Today we paired it with a panzanella salad. It was fresh and crisp. The service is delightful!A delicious, reasonably priced brunch spot.  The menu is on the small side, and every item looks like a hit.My experience with this store has been pleasant and filling. I wish they were cheaper but I dont mind paying more for a more flavorful experience. They could use a little bit of remodeling though.  

I ordered the bobby and the girl made it really fast Within 5 mins i was in and out Cant beat that!! A delicious Quality sandwich made fresh for me :D.

Thank you for your hard work and for making me feel like a valued customer.I love the food! I just wish the staff was happier to be there. I don't understand the 'toods folks. I'm a regular friendly customer who loves Piada, but I don't love the unfriendliness off the the employees. They rush you through and act like its a difficult chore to add anything to your bowl. Makes me not want to frequent Piada anymore.Very good food and a great price. The beef fried rice is some of the best I ever had. The staff is friendly and they cook everything fresh.Great late-night pizza joint with booze and billiards.
I had a simple cheese pizza and a Jack and Coke. The pizza crust was great - not too thick\/thin and cooked well. Easy pizza to eat. I like how they cut it in square pieces.
Thank you for being open late (2am) for us night owls!
I'll visit this place again.

They offer a gluten-free crust (10.5in) but I haven't tried it yet. I'll update this post when I do.If Dagwood Bumstead was Mexican, the Torta Del Rey would be his sandwich of choice. It has ham, cheese, pork sirloin, milanesa, sausage, chorizo, eggs, avocado, jalapenos, onions and tomato (hold for me). Whew! All of that comes on a soft telera with a side of fries, plus chips and salsa for around $9. Sound like a deal? It gets better because it's enough for two meals. I ate the first half for lunch at the restaurant and the second half for dinner at my hotel in El Paso, some 430 miles later. The second time around was even better - the sandwich ingredients had all that time to intermingle, kind of like a day old burrito. Yum.

And be sure to get extra tomatillo salsa. It's the one that comes with the torta, not the salsa they serve with the chips. One taste and you'll want to drink the stuff straight from the bowl!Mr. K has been standing long at their corner for what seems to be generations. Charlotte's Southend has gentrified nicely to incorporate a younger crowd as we all as more contemporary, hipster small businesses. 

Mr. K shows that if you do a few things extraordinary, your business won't be pushed out from gentrification. I did not get the southern comfort foods of burgers, fries or onion rings, but instead I got the chocolate dipped ice cream cone. It was delicious from beginning to end. It also has a little plastic drip cup thingy to prevent excess ice cream from dripping over onto your hands. I haven't had an ice cream such as this in a long time. 

If I am ever around, I will have to stop by and try the mouth water hamburgers and fries. This place is old fashioned, but it does what it does extremely well.My new favorite sushi spot! Great prices, lunch is $21.95 and dinner is 26.95 all you can eat! Staff is really friendly! I am seriously loving this place! Everyone needs to come and try it. It reminds me of a hole in the wall kind of place. In the smiths parking lot by LvAc, kind of hidden but great place!Honestly the WORST EXPERIENCE I've ever encountered on a vacation. This hotel and their poor management are the sole reason that I will never go back to Vegas. Our group got evicted from the hotel after getting stuck in the elevator because they believed it to be our fault. It was either the eviction from our $450 room or paying $1,000 for having the maintenance guys from OTIS come and let us out after being trapped in there for an hour. If I could give this hotel 0 or negative stars, I wouldn't second guess it.Oh My God!! Best food in Cleveland! James a genius chef!! The food is fresh LOCALLY farmed. (Which I love) The menu is different every day. Mickey the bartender makes the best Bees Knees! Yum yum!  You won't regret trying this amazing place!!The sushi is so good, it makes you realize that soy sauce can be completely superfluous. And the service is so genuinely welcoming, it makes you feel like they've been waiting for you to arrive. Can't wait to return!I've been here twice now. I was skeptical on my first visit. Celebrity chef restaurants are usually expensive and fussy, but not always that good.

It was a nice surprise to find that the service and the food are great.

Service is efficient and attentive without being fussy and annoying. 

Be sure to have the tuna nachos. Sushi style maguro chopped into a tartare and drizzled with amazing habanero and herb sauces served with house made corn and flour tortilla chips.
It's truly awesome.

Our entrees were excellent as well. 

A nice experience in Vegas.The food was excellent and interior decoration was gorgeous.  Also, there was a pianist present.

However, our waitress was very rude and inattentive.  Other wait staff was kind enough to assist us.  The manager also came by from time to time when we looked helpless.Would not recommend this restaurant.  We had ordered a delmonico and tasted like it was boiled, not seared like a steak should be.with what barely resembled blue cheese on top.  Also ordered a seafood dish which was not cooked well either.Weve been coming to Sunrise for at least 7 years and it never dissapoints. It is quite busy all the time, so be prepared to wait at least 5 minutes for a table and up to 15 during peak times (most of the time during weekends). However, once you're seated you won't regret it as the servers are always attentive, your drinks will always be full and the fresh squeezed orange juice is one of the most delicious things on the menu! In addition, the omelettes (my favorite) are always made with the freshest ingredients and cooked to perfection. 

All in all, In the many years we've been coming here everything has always been good and consistent, which is why we continue to choose Sunrise regardless of what trendy spot opens. If you want healthy options, friendly smiles and a homey atmosphere regardless of how crowded it is, this is the place to be.Pizza is delicious and a slice or two for lunch is so affordable. You must try the buffalo chicken pizza! Unfortunately, the last time I was in there, there was some inner-company tension going on with an argument in front of paying customers. It was definitely uncomfortable so i hope they can work on customer service.I have been here a few times. The burgers are huge. I had fish tacos the last time I went and they were gross. go figure. They have an amazingly cheap breakfast that is pretty good. The service is amazing. What I like most is the beer selection. Anything from Lost Coast is good w me.Another consistent visit to Harrisburg Family. This time I had the Philly Cheesesteak sandwich with fries and it was way more than one could eat and flavorful too. Maybe not the best one I have ever had, but definitely good. Our waitress was super friendly and didnt mind us hanging out to chat since the supper crowd was dwindling. Great choice for homestyle cooking in the Burg!I almost didn't want to leave a review because I wanna keep this amazing spot to myself. But this is definitely a little hole in the wall that leads to Mama's kitchen! Plus I've never been anywhere with $5 full size lunch specials! Honey walnut shrimp is $8 or $9 and most Chinese places charge a few bucks more. Only down side is that it's super small, 5 tables total. It seats 4, 4, 2, 2, and maybe 5-6 on the bigger table. It wasn't busy when we went so I'm not sure if this place ever gets packed or not. But this was definitely a great find that I'll be returning to.LOCATION IS CLOSED!  CLOSED! CLOSED!

Business available for sale (Hand written sign on the door). 
I was on a bagel fix for the past two days, figure I'd give it a shot but the establishment was closed and apparently for sale.  All lights were out at 9:30am on Sunday and missing some tables\/chairs.Stumbled upon this place on a Thursday night after a long day of driving\/ walking. Saw a sign outside their restaurant for reverse happy hour (10pm- close) for a $10 pizza. I waited a little under an hour for 10 to roll around and while they don't take orders over the phone, I sat at the bar and they took my order. Also, if you check in on Yelp you can get a free order of cheesy bread! $10 FOR A PIZZA AND CHEESY BREAD?! Heck yeah!! Service was quick and the staff was super friendly! Took my food back to my hotel (except I had to have at least a slice in the Uber). It was DELICIOUS! I ordered all pepperoni and the cheese just melts in your mouth. The pizza comes cut in four large slices and the cheesy bread was so good! Pizza+ breadsticks in our hotel suite was the perfect way to end the first night of my Vegas getaway!!! Will definitely return when I'm back in Vegas!All I can say is YUMMMM! We wondered in here with not to many expectations... but the service was awesome, food was great, and prices very reasonable. We will be back!I've been here numerous times thinking the next time it will be better.... It's not! Sushi is plain at best. You can sit down when it's not busy and wait so long for your drink order, you can have your drink, appetizer & sushi selected before the waiter is even there to greet. My wife was seated under a heater that midway thru dinner started dripping on her. Your saki bomb glass is a thin glass you would expect for a vodka soda & did I mention the sushi is nothing to brag about. Biltmore is in dire need of a new sushi restaurant. Stingray is a disgrace.I came here about 15 minutes before they closed, I figured they would hate me coming in late, but I was welcomed and treated perfectly. Ordered the Cuban sandwich. It was not your typical Cuban, it was better. It was so good I can't imagine ordering anything else. Had the chocolate chip cookie and a Moreo (a giant homemade Oreo) both great cookies.  I ordered an iced tea for my beverage, it cost $2.50 which I think is a lot for tea, but I understand drinks are a high profit item for small stores like this. I did have a real problem when they wanted to charge me 50 cents for a refill of iced tea. Told the guy no thanks, u can just keep the glass. 
The moral of the story is 50 cents cost these guys one star in my review. But the sandwich, cookies, and service were excellent.There are sooo many choices in Vegas and we were standing right in front of the buffet at the Wynn. Although probably a great choice we were looking for something more specific and to be honest a little lighter on the pocket. We happen to ask the sweetest lady named Martha Mejia. Let me tell you about service! She not only gave us a great recommendation (Allegro), she went out of her way, called the manager and made sure there was availability, walked us to the restaurant, AND make sure we got a reservation right away! She was quite exceptional and man we were impressed! The food was delicious, great recommendations Martha, thank you!So I came back here after a while so I had to update my reviews. Just because it's still so good. Simple, fresh, cheap, great service (really). What else can you want? It's the only Vietnamese restaurant where they proposed me the "galettes de riz". Those are so, so, soooo delicious. It's basically some rice paste filled with grounded pork and Asian mushrooms served with Vietnamese sausage and an upgraded fish sauce. Just note that it is not in the menu and only offered during the weekends...plus it goes fast so it's best to go for lunch.  The Pho is great and they have many other typical soups on their menu. For those you like to keep it safe and conventional I heard the fried rice and the general Tao is pretty good. It's a BYOW in top of that. Maybe not a place to take someone on a first date....But if your date is anything like me she'll enjoy going there on a week night.There's always a wait but its definitely worth it!! 
Food comes out almost immediately after you order.
Service is okay, the servers really don't stop by
but the food is "WOW" !!My new Fried Chicken FAVORITE!

OK so my hubby and I came into the strip on Saturday night and had parked at Bally's (note: it's not free parking-we paid $7 for a few hours)

Anywhoo with no intention of going out to eat, we saw this shop on the way down the escalators and thought why not as we'd heard great thing about it from the Yelp Elite crew that went (I missed out)

And I'm so glad we did! 

We weren't starving - so I ordered the 1 wing and hubby got the thigh or was it breast... whatever it was he loved it. Thick and juicy - lol!

I love love the seasoning and my wing was perfect and moist too! 

With it I ordered the Moscato and Modelo 24oz can and we were set! 

Food was FABULOUS!
Service was SENSATIONAL!

Staff were spot on service and you weren't standing around guessing. They were all very cool! 

Thank you! We'll be back for sure!I became a little sad when I pulled up the Crumb & Spigot - I didn't even notice that Western Reserve had been closed and renovated into this place! Dang... I loved that bread place... No matter, I still went in for a night of drinks and dessert with two friends. It was pretttttttttty empty on a Thursday. Two people at the bar, and two tables finishing up their meals.

The host at the front was very friendly and offered to change thermostat when I offhandedly said it was cold. How nice! Our server was friendly as well. He chatted with my friend about fantasy football. We were feeling cider-y that night and ordeerd the pear ciders on the menu. They were just eh. Then, a different server took our dessert order and she put in two brownie desserts instead of the dessert special I ordered. No big deal, though I did kinda want that apple upside down dessert.... Makes me wonder what deliciousness COULD have been bad. 

Definitely worth coming back if and when I save up some money to try a dinner there. I've personally heard mixed reviews of their food quality and associated cost, so I am a little apprehensive though. So, going for dessert\/drinks was me playing it safe. Solid three stars with potential.I'd say 4.5\/5 overall because as they say on annual employee evals, "there's always room for improvement." Additionally, 2 of the 3 times I've called in my order, I've been placed on hold for over 5 minutes. The second time resulted in me arriving in the parking lot prior to them taking my order.

Food is easily 5\/5 though. Everything I've tried has been delicious. The gyros and Greek fries are the best I've had, not that I am a gyro or Greek fry aficionado or anything though. So, YMMV, but I don't think most people would be disappointed.My favorite deli in all of the Vegas\/Henderson area. Food comes out quick, fresh, delicious every time. Gets very busy, so expect a wait most of the time. I've been coming here for years and it never disappoints. Amazingly it's still one of the best kept secrets in town. Strongly suggest the cabbage soup, matzo ball soup, turkey Reuben, and macaroni salad. Grab a chocolate covered Halvah on the way out.I've been to this Corleone's two or three times now and I'm done with it. The food tastes ok, but if you're a diehard Philly fan, it probably won't be. On a typical $10 order, it seems overpriced by about $2-3. And even worse, it doesn't fill you up! But where it totally fails is the food pickup process.

This last time, I went in on a busy Friday lunch hour and it was packed. And here's where it got annoying. All of the customers were crowded near the takeout counter while the staff was serving orders on the other side. I noticed that people also stood in front of the soda machines which is probably the WORST place one could be at. It's basically a huge mess of a dozen people in this tiny area waiting for their food. To make matters worse, the staff announces the order numbers without a mic. It gets so loud inside you can barely hear the numbers. An announcer mic playing through the overhead speakers would help immensely. Or just give everyone a number card to put at their table and have a server on-hand to deliver the food, similar to what Culver's does in their drive-through.

I tried the pizza for the first time, and wow, it was terrible. Why is it so hard for Phoenix shops to make a pizza with flavor? I was slinging better stuff when I was in high school working for a convenience store. I got an ounce of orange grease with two slices of cheese. It was crazy, and two napkins couldn't contain this BP gusher on my plate. My coworker had the cheese steak and told me later that he blew up the bathroom an hour after.As a fan of French cuisine, I decided to stop here for Sunday brunch. There was a short wait so I ordered a Bellini from the bar. When we were seated I got a hibiscus mimosa. 
We ordered salmon faume, chilled cantaloupe soup, a pastry plate, and beignets. The salmon came out first and it was perfect for sharing. It was served deconstructed so we got to put everything on the baguette ourselves making sure we got just the right amount of cream cheese. 
The cantaloupe soup was delicious, it was cold and had a grilled cantaloupe slice as garnish.
The beignets were THE BEST. They came out hot and covered in powdered sugar served with caramel and chocolate sauce on the side. They were melt in your mouth good. I couldn't believe it. 
The pastry plate came out with a croissant, cheese Danish, a cinnamon roll, and blueberry muffin. The croissant was the best croissant I've ever had as well as the cheese Danish. 
It's a beautiful location and some of the best pastries I've ever eaten. Definitely check this out when you're in the area!Sandwich was good, service was helpful, will come back for sure.Such a cute and delicious place for dinner in the town of Waxhaw. The servers were very friendly and helpful, food tasted great! I had the New Orleans pasta and was very pleased. The fried green tomatoes had a great crust on them.  I would not consider "child friendly" but great for adults wanting a nice evening meal.Excellent traditional Mayan cuisine! We found this place on Yelp and loved it!! We will definitely come back. The cochinita pibil enchiladas were delicious!!Surprised that every time I come here, the price for the customize meal changed. This time was at the range of $11.50, compared to I first came here at the range of about $8 (few years ago). But I understand the inflation as everything costs more nowadays. Therefore, I chose whatever on the laminated menu instead for the time ever! 

Service was both slow and fast- slow at finding a waitress to take your oder, and fast at getting your food.The Strip District is one of my favorite neighborhoods in Pittsburgh. Lots of restaurants and markets, bursting with local flavor. Authentic Pittsburgh goodness. I had brunch at Marty's Market with Christine on a sunny Saturday morning. It was the perfect place for a long overdue catch up session. Everything about Marty's market, from the seasonal menu to the modern market space is right up my alley. 

I have a special love for brunch and a weakness for poached eggs. They also have a number of vegetarian options. Obviously, I couldn't turn down the Eggs Florentine ($8). Poached organic eggs, spinach, and hollandaise sauce on an English muffin. I've never seen such pale hollandaise, but it was still flavorful and creamy. I satisfied my craving for freshly squeezed orange juice. 

I also ordered a side of their house vegan sausage ($3.50). The "sausage" patties were nicely browned and very meaty. I don't know what all the ingredients are, but the fennel definitely makes a big difference. I took one patty to go so John could try it too.Tired. The place seems tired.

I always thought of it a step above Denny's.

I had spinach Benedict . Poached eggs were severely undercooked, muffin was burned. Waitress came by three times. Once for order, once for food and once for check. I got charged 3 bucks for each small glass of watered down orange juice. Potatoes were hurried, meaning burned on outside and cold inside. Couple next to meet moved due to all the kitchen noise with Mostly empty restaurant.

Manager seemed nice but could not make up for a bad meal and mediocre service.Went here last night ordered the salmon over cooked, rude server!  Sent the salmon back ordered something else.  Took forever to get my meal husband was done eating still was charged for meal.  Gave me a 2.50 off my bill.  What a joke!  Won't be coming back here anytime soon.The first time I ate at Panago I was very skeptical, I was under the impression it was just another run of the semolina mill pizza joint, and I was wrong!

I was blown away by my first Panago experience which left me wanting more after I finished my S-10'' pizza and was comfortably bloated. 

Panagopoulos has a neat history: Firstly it's Canadian! And was born in BC. Now they boast nearly 200 location across Canada, surely they must be doing something right. A few years back they also stepped up their game by introducing Panago Cucina, a take-home product line featuring balsamic vinegar, EVOO, various sauces and salts.

The one pizza I swear by at Panago is the New York Deli because I'm a raging carnivore, slaying everything from Ostrich to Pterodactyls. The NYD features Italian tomato sauce, pepperoni, Genoa salami, bacon, Canadian ham, spicy Italian sausage, mozzarella + cheddar. Just a beloved gongshow of salty goodness. The dough was nice and fluffy, (a nice change from all the napoli style thin crust I am used to devouring), and the sauce was rich and everything was seasoned well. Panago is up there for my favourite fast food pizzas without a doubt. 

Yes the price may appear to be somewhat high @ $11.50 for a S-10", but it's worth every penny. This is not a pizza you would eat every day, and truthfully if you're very hungry the 10' will do you proper. 

Thumbs up no doubt.A very good mesquite burger. The fries are lightly coated, hot and fresh. Service was prompt and friendly. We would definitely come back.  The restaurant was clean with severa condiments available at the table. 

Side note: there was a young man in the restaurant who was not a customer but seemed like he may have been on something? The (I presume) manager came out  and handled it very professionally. He was polite and kind, inquiring how the young man was doing. He didn't kick him out but said to let him know if he needed anything. The guy left soon after.I went there for lunch with 8 other people.  Getting a reservation was not a problem.

Their Wednesday lunch buffet for $12.99 has gone downhill.  On the menu was just regular rice (not even coconut rice), chicken wings, chicken stir fry, beef stir fry, pork stir fry and seafood & veggie stir fry...... uh... No pad thai?  No dessert?  The selection was not worth the $12.99.

To top it all off, at the end of the meal the server comes and asks if we wanted separate bills.  We asked for separate bills, then she says the gratuity would be tacked on automatically if we chose separate bills. Huh?  That's never happened before, where a restaurant tacks on a 15% gratuity if we ask for separate bills.  Let alone a buffet where we had to serve ourselves.

I wasn't happy and it will take quite a bit of persuasion to go back there.

P.S.  I had a really bad case of the upset stomach after eating there.  A few others did as well.Great atmosphere  loved being able to have a beer and watch the panthers.  

The fried chicken is really worth coming here. I will come when I have a hankering for fried chicken again. I was disappointed in the cheesy grits - very bland. I had to ad extra extra salt and pepper to add flavor.   

The bar selection was ok. I'm on the lookout for locals and had a couple nice ones. 

Server was friendly and ok.second visit here within the past year.  i had excellent bibimbap both times, others had various jigae.  the mark of a decent korean place is the panchon (side dishes) imho.  gangnam's are just right, including odeng, my favorite.  very clean (hard to do in a bbq place).  friendly\/informative staff.  i lived in korea for five years and gangnam is a great go-to spot.7.10.17 5pm Lauren is the only one who can get anything right & especially tonight.  I met a friend of mine who wanted to sit in the dining area instead of at the bar where I'd rather sit w\/ Lauren, who made my cocktail perfectly.  We sat in Diane's section & she was great.  It's the chef who screwed up.  The people who sat down before us were served their dinner, after we finished our meal.  The manager was apologizing all over the place.  Their steak was suppose to be medium rare, but was totally rare.  

My friend ordered a Grilled Chicken sandwich w\/ only tomato & lettuce, no mayo... the bread was soggy from how much Mayo was on it & the other half of the chicken was hard & difficult to cut.  My Grilled Veggie Salad was horrible.  The avocado, feta & tomato were so delish.  The zucchini, spinach & red bell peppers was soggy & mushy.  There were only a few pieces of corn & the asparagus was cut up branches of it.  Not good & very disappointing.

I usually come for breakfast, same bartenders & I love their breakfast.  Other than that, I am looking forward to the Tuna Salad Sandwich here again.  I'll have to make sure it's the right person making the tuna salad.I decided to stop in for take out after driving past it several times.  The lunch menu featured many options for the right price.  I believe I paid less then $7 dollars for my selection.  I was very surprised to see that the lunch portion was large enough to be considered dinner size.  Hot tea is available as you wait .  The dining area is very spacious .I'm a low key kinda guy and that makes this one of my favorite casinos in Vegas. A couple friends and I partook in some special sandwiches and then made the trip over here to check out their well known diner. They say it's one of the few places left in Vegas where you can get a great steak for under $10. We didn't have the steak but we did order a few beers (they brew their own) and an appetizer sampler. The food here is roughly 1990 prices. If you lived in Vegas and didn't gamble, this city would have the lowest cost of living in the country.

The casino wasn't half bad either. It's close to the strip but not on it, which means $10 tables are available. I won a couple hundred bucks here. Can't say I'm unhappy about that.

Will definitely make a return trip here. It's a nice little getaway from all the razzle and dazzle of the strip.We have always been super into Food Network shows and just food shows in general.  Being a long time fan of the show Iron Chef and seeing some of the cool things Michael Symon has done, and also seeing his famous brussels sprouts on numerous "best thing i ever had" and "unique eats" we told ourselves one of his restaurants is a must try.  

The Tremont area in Cleveland is different.  Driving up to the restaurant after getting off the freeway I thought we were in the wrong neighborhood.  I guess Cleveland is just like that.  We parked a couple streets down and I thought to myself.. "why would an iron chef open a restaurant in this area?"  I guess it's just part of the charm.  We walked in and waited for close to 5 minutes before anyone acknowledged us.  I realize they were busy and at the tail end of HH, but we had made eye contact with the bartender and he did nothing to get the hostess.  
The restaurant decor is really cool, pretty flooring, a mix of old and industrial.  Even the restrooms were super cute!   Music was super loud, don't come here for a romantic dinner as you'll have to scream across the table for conversation. 

I was so excited when I read the cocktail menu.  Ever since I had the best cocktail at Nellcote in Chicago, I've been on the hunt for something to top it.  I got the Bela - the ginger infused vodka lured me in.  The cocktail was so sad.  Not only was it small - in a miniature highball glass, there was no taste of ginger, or vodka as a matter of fact.  It tasted like soda water with some lime juice squeezed in it. Needless to say, my hunt for the best cocktail continues and I stuck with wine for the rest of the evening. 

We weren't that hungry so we chose to split a couple smaller items.  We had the brussels sprouts, bone marrow, and chicken livers.  Let me tell you, we were soo excited for the brussels sprouts.  They way other celebrity chefs and TV food personnel had described them was just intriguing.  But oh man, were we let down.  The brussels sprouts tasted burnt, soggy but under cooked at the same time, there were no capers and the walnuts seemed to have been tossed onto the dish as an afterthought.  What happened to the sweet, tangy, and crunchy deliciousness I thought we would be served up?  I suppose that only happens on TV.  I thought the bone marrow was good even though the bf thought they were just ok.  Too much bread for the delicate marrow.  The accompaniments were good on it.  The crispy chicken livers was a dish that could have been great but again was just ok.  The pieces of liver were so big I had to cut them up otherwise I would've only gotten a mouthful of liver and none of the polenta.  Maybe this is the way the chef intended for it to be eaten, but wouldn't it have been nice if the livers were smaller and fried perfectly all around? That way, I could have had a perfect little bite of liver with some creamy polenta along with it instead of having to chop everything up!

I wanted to try some desserts but because our small dishes were so lacking, we chose to skip.  I'm not from the Cleveland area and haven't had the opportunity to try many other restaurants, but if this is supposed to be on of the better restaurants, man, I have to say that Cleveland has a LOT of opportunity for up and coming chefs.  

I want to be an Iron Chef too - they get to open restaurants with so-so food but people will go in hoards anyway just because of the name.  (ok, I can't say this about all celebrity chefs, e by Jose Andres in Vegas was pretty amazing)I like the Cochinita Pibil the best. Not a fan of the other tacos and I could do without the rice and beans. The horchata is something to write about. I have never had horchata with fresh ingredients...Very Tasty. The server was nice and quick. You have to get your own salsa so stock up. Would love to stop by again!If you want to see how to ruin a steak,  this is the place to go. 

THE GOOD, BAD and UGLY.  Good - the wine, beet salad and calamari.  Bad - cocktails in a water glass with 90% ice AND serving a steak raw on the inside burnt on the outside.  If you don't know how to cook a steak don't put it on the menu, if you can't tell it is raw when you pick it up and put it on a cold plate don't serve it up. Ugly - after sending it back you bring back the same steak cut in half put on TWO COLD PLATES with the same mash potatoes and wilted asparagus then tell me their is a fine line between rare and medium rare. 

I walked out, after looking at the attached pictures you would too.  Steak tasted like blood, see the red mash potatoes.Good buffet. Pleasant customer service.  Was crowded which is a good sign. I would definitely add this to my list of places to eat.Friendly service and good gelato. I had the rose water gelato and it was quite good! Ambiance was very relaxing and there were plenty of spaces for groups. I'm down for coming back again if I'm in the area.Cauliflower Tacos: yes ! Tasty, especially if you are a cauliflower lover.
Potato Tacos: Skip, mine was dry and plain. The potato is basically chopped up french fries...with a few drops of lime dressing.
Garbanzo\/Potato Burger: I'd suggest a different burger, this one was underwhelming, my husband ordered it with and it looked like a plate of carbs.
I'm determined to try this place again though for the other items or more cauli-tacos!Will not be coming here anymore. Shows how they don't care of the reviews you leave. After coming here the food now is not that good anymore.Only the best pizza. The gourmet veggie and buffalo chicken is my favorite. Dont forget the cheesy garlic bread.Worst service in Midwood!!  It was like pulling teeth to get anything from the staff.  No silverware, no plates, and waiting 20 minutes for a drink refill.  Sad because the location is great and food was good.  They somehow forgot they work in the service industry!!!Although I have been to the Bay St location, I thought I knew what to expect, but this time it was with a large group, and Mercatto (Toronto St.) exceeded my expectations.

Perhaps a large group is the way to come, because you get to sample so many varieties of food. The lovely young ladies that served us were as friendly as they were lovely; any requests were provided immediately.
 
Highly recommended.This place is cool. Walking thru a pawn shop into a speakeasy setting was a first. Inside was great and the small plates were too. Really good place for a group of friends to share dishes. Expect to spend $50pp since you'll be ordering multiple dishes.I live very close to this restaurant and I've seen the change of ownership of this place several times over the years.   I decided to give it a try last week and found the atmosphere, service and the food was very good.  

I found the place wasn't big, maybe they have 15 to 20 tables.  But we were sitting very comfortable.  Not like some small restaurants where they try to put as many tables as they can in a tiny space they have.  All tables have table clothes, no plastic sheets over them.
After we placed our food order, the waitress brought over a small dish of appetizer.  It was sour cabbage, like kimchi.  Next came our complimentary soup, which I find sometimes it's not being offered in some chinese restaurant nowadays.  Two free dishes so far...bonus.

We ordered the oysters with ginger and green onions,  free-range chicken, seafood with Chinese broccoli and spicy tender pork.  All dishes were a generous portion.  There were eight pieces of oysters and it was my favorite dish.  They were tasty and not oily at all.  

We were given a 10% discount.  I think it's because they just reopened recently.  The total was $42 with taxes so the price was very reasonable.  We liked it so much we've made reservation for Chinese New Year.
.Great service but unfortunately the food was not on par with the service. Ordered 3 scrambled eggs that looked like 2 also being overcooked, freshly squeezed orange juice was Tropicana of sort(rip off), overcooked omelette, dry potatoes and overall the food is pretty bland.Ok, this is a food court resto so straight up I'm not expecting fine dining, but it should at least be edible. I had no idea that a spring roll could taste that bad?! It was also hard as a rock. Bad start. My ginger chicken soup was also not very hot but the flavours were good, if not a bit bland. I added a packet of hot sauce and that improved it. Other than that, it was Ok - plenty of chicken, ramen noodles were hot and the veggies were fresh. Given it was only warm to begin with, it was stone cold before I could finish it. What a waste.I'm giving 4 stars as a resident who remembers the previous establishments that occupied this building, going back to 2006.  Given that metric, PATRIOT adequately fills the needs of a neighborhood family restaurant\/taphouse.

On a recent outing, the food was well prepared (standard bar fare with a few interesting twists, like the pimento cheeseburger) and the microbrew menu was quite impressive.

Thumbs up to the improved decor, as well.

Here's hoping they can handle the weekend crowds with ease.I have never had a better cup of coffee. I went in with my boyfriend expecting to maybe get a cold drink or some tea, then there on on the menu "ALMOND MOCHA". I was like, eh why not try something new. It was amazing. SO GOOD. I would highly recommend getting your coffee from this place and try the Almond Mocha. It will not disappoint you!!I've ordered from here a lot. The most recent time I noticed my portion of noodles was a lot smaller than usual - about 60% what it usually is! I called the restaurant and they said portion sizes have gone down due to their costs. They were unwilling to do anything for me despite being a frequent customer. Also, the guy who delivers is super sullen and once got pissed off at me for ordering via JustEat. I'll take my money elsewhere from now on.Customer service here is the absolute worst! Management seriously needs to get some people with some personality and regard for customers who are patronizing. Smoothies are almost always inconsistent. Let's not even begin to talk about the sandwiches. They have no care in the world how your food comes out. Lettuce is ALWAYS old, bread is always cut wrong and put on the sandwich backwards. I believe if they were to be a customer in their own establishment, they would be just as irritated and upset as patrons. Worst possible location to visit. I'll happily drive 15 minutes pass this location (which is near my home) for better customer service and beverages.Place is cozy... Food was delish!!! But what I liked the most was the dessert fried banana with coconut ice cream! Yum yumReminds me of the best Chinese food I've eaten in New York and San Francisco.  Cumin spiced lamb and the ma po tofu are special favorites of mine.The ice cream sandwiches were AMAZING and so affordable!!  The only suggestion I can possibly make is to ensure the tables and chairs are cleaned more often.  Our table had ice cream on top and two chairs looked as if someone had danced in them.  The owner was super nice and  I LOVED the ice cream treats.  We will be ordering the giant cookie for my daughter's birthday in March.  We will be back soon and often!!Freaking love This place!!!!! Been here 5-6 times over the last few years and it never disappoints. Love the buffalo wings, big wac, soynamis, donuts, breakfast burritos... like I said, never been disappointed!We visited on a Saturday evening dining room was half-full, very disappointed in the fact that the complementary bread and olive oil didn't come till after the food arrived! Food was mediocre, OK nothing to write home about! Was excited to try some homemade meatballs but they were fair and marinara sauce was very heavy and the chicken piccata was thick versus ultra thin cutlet like it should be. Waitress was fair not overly friendly or helpful. I was indecisive between two entrées and looking for some guidance but she was just silent so I ended up going with the chicken. The dining room was ultracold to the point it was uncomfortable. With so many other local Italian restaurant probably will not be visiting again!Honestly I was hesitant going to this restaurant because of the reviews. However, I'm glad I did because my husband and I really enjoyed the food. 

We had the chili cheese fries appetizer and it was yummy! I had the beef brisket dinner and my husband had the half rack. The meat from the ribs fell off the bone and my brisket was no where near dry, it was tender. I asked for BBQ sauce and that was good too - tangy and just the right amount of sweetness. (In my opinion, they should keep their BBQ sauce available on the tables.) 

We were both satisfied and stuffed at the end of our dinner. My only small complaint was that the baked beans and mashed potatoes came out a little cold. Besides that, they were both good. Portions are huge, service was good and waitress was attentive. We will be going back again.I love steak and shake but this one is franchised not a corporate location and things are a bit different, and of course casino locations don't often honor things. This location does not honor free kids meals but does do the half price shakes from 2 to 4. 
Today we all went, 13 of us and instead of putting us together they seated us at 3 different tables. One by the door, one about midway and one over on far wall. What the hell? Who seats people like that? Our waiter was nice at first but after taking orders we never saw him again until much much later. Our table of 4 had eaten, all our drinks were empty, our shakes had still not come and the other 2 tables we were with had finished their meals and shakes long before our food or shakes came out. We finally got our waiters attention and he asked if anybody had brought our shakes, ummmm no, they have not. He brought them a few minutes later in to go cups stating they were out of regular glasses but to us the cups looked smaller,  they said they weren't but they appeared to be. I've had the garlic burger at other locations but here they fix it differently. When I've had it it arrives with a glaze on the bun and has the white garlic sauce on it but at the Vegas location it arrived with meat and bun and nothing else. The bun looked nothing like the picture,  there was no sauce or anything. When I inquired I was told this was how they do it at this location and told they have don't put anything on it but they did offer to bring me some garlic mayonnaise. I have no idea why a garlic burger does not come with the garlic mayo on it to begin with, odd that. I'll go back to a regular location but not this one.Not a bad spot to watch a sporting event and indulge in some major eye candy... the uniforms the waitresses wear are totally degrading, trashy, slutty, skimpy and totally awesome.... But let's get back to the restaurant shall we?  

I had the American cheese burger with fries, pretty much the most boring basic burger that you can get here (however, it was delish), they also have lamb, veggie and even chicken burgers I believe.  3 variety of french fries is nice, waffle, steak and standard. 

Our real reason we went here was to watch the Lakers v. Nuggets b-ball game.  There's a couple giant screen TVs (over 100 inches) and then the place is surrounded by HD flat screens.  They also serve 100 ounce 30 dollar beers (not sure what flavors) and the bring them out in these really cool bong looking containers, not to mention 4-7 happy hour with 2 for 1s.  The only draw back to that is that you have to go up to bar to be able to get the drink special, kind of lame....

Big, juicy burgers, and a hot-naughty wait staff, lots of TVs, 2 for 1s... if there's a game you're looking for, come and check out this place, it's great for the 'typical guy guy'.Good. Not great. Probably don't ever need to go again. Cool experience but food wasn't amazing.This was the worst breakfast place I have ever been to. I went there with my boyfriend. They asked for tip up front. My boyfriend ordered green tea. They were out of green tea, so the associate offered a different tea instead of making more green tea. I ordered coffee and was not even pointed to the coffee bar to get cream. Our food took forever to be delivered to our table. My soup was cold! Avoid this place like the plague. The restaurant looks like a gutter and the service was horrible.I can't tell everyone how many times I've complained to corporate and upper management about this location. I've told managers about them closing early I've told the managers about the assistant managers sitting down talking, counting money while there's a long line of customers more importantly the food gets put away early and they don't wanna make more for you. Today, I ordered the honey walnut chicken like I always do and there was maybe 5 pieces left small she gave them to me she says what else you? I said is that a full order of honey walnut she said 7 pieces is a full order you sure you want to wait 4 minutes for 2 more pieces? I looked at my bill and realized their charging everyone a quarter extra yet to quarter but check your bill from now on the 2 item color combo is $7.50 and the honey chicken is a $1.25 up charge so that's $8.75 she charges $9 I hate this location but it's near my house I used to love panda and eat weekly but because of this location and the people and they're disgusting food I hate panda!
 People say they like this place cause there's no line you know why there's no line because nobody wants to eat here they're sick of it. They've lost a lot of business. I can't wait till they close down because they don't know how to run a business you need new managers here and new people working here they only speak Spanish and if you speak English they have nothing to say to you sorry but I'm speaking the truth go there and find out for yourself and for upper management shame on you for not responding the 1st 2 times that I complained to you about what everybody is saying on here!I'll start off by saying the staff is so sweet and very attentive and the views are spectacular. My boyfriend and I came here for happy hour at around 3:45 and ordered each a Cadillac Margarita. Drinks were okay nothing spectacular, but what really set off the vibe was the absurd drunk woman talking so loud and screaming at times next to us. People all around the restaurant seemed to be annoyed by her. It bothered us so much that we just ended up leaving. I wish management would have said something to her to at least kept her voice down because it ruined our first experience here.100% Satisfaction !!! This establishment is AMAZING. Every time my friends and I dine here the crew is friendly, courteous, and on point!!  The restaurant is clean and the food makes me always get two plates !! they really know how to guest guests!!What a fun place. I loved the vibe, music, and food. I am not usually a fan of German food but I enjoyed my Original Brat meal. The potatoes are awesome! My server was fine but he really lacked personality. The gal on the way out made up for it. She talked to me about the history of the restaurant and was most gracious! I have to say, and my friends will laugh at this comment, I enjoyed the Accordion player. He is quite good!McDonalds has burgers with more flavor then this place...  Literally no taste to it... And the "bacon" looked more like bits of vomit... Graphic yes but that's all that could come to mind after attempting to eat this thing. Just say no.... Trust me your off going to McDonalds, Burger King... Or Wendy's and Ordering from the $1 menu.Went to the pub during the World Cup.

It was great!  It was probably the largest gathering of soccer fans in the area.  It felt great to take in the beautiful game with those who appreciate it and watch it religiously.  The food definitely had a flare to it, and it will be my number one stop for the upcoming UEFA Championships.Quick spot to get lunch during the Conf Cobb salad with MargaritaAttention yelp losers. I know most of you never get out of the house because you live in Madison but if you do give breakwater a try. Great craft beers, great food and a lot of fun. Great happy hour for adults. If you want to go down to State Street and hang out with pimple face kids that's fine but no one's down there for happy hour.  So sick of people reviewing places and saying  they couldn't find  a spot to park, two stars, have you ever been to New York. You can park at Breakwater. On the water fantastic views see you there. Be on TV or Watch it on your couch. It's 5 o'clock somewhere ;)It's a bit pricey and ala cart so be advised but this place serves some great food. I had the lamb chops with corn chowder and popcorn grits. The food was delicious and really well plated. The servers were so friendly and helpful. The entire dinner was enjoyable and relaxing. The atmosphere is rustic and it is a bit noisy but it's workable. This is a great place for an elegant meal in a relaxed setting. Enjoy. We did.I live on the west coast and look forward to stopping at QSL every time I am in town. Quick, reliable and priced fairlyI finally found the courage to try Salim's baba ganoush. I only wish I had done so sooner! The man knows his eggplants. I think it is safe to say he has the best ganoush in PittsburghThis place is very family oriented. I went on Father's Day.
 they really pay attention to you but not just with water refills or a good fathers day greeting or a gift for your father at the end of the meal. it's just that instead of home they share at a restaurant and that is a special thing. The meal was great. salad looks like you wouldn't eat it but i ate it, the dressing was making it like the salad was a million bucks. i got  the french dip if  you don't like too much au jus  then you really dont need that dish because if you dont like it shhhhhhhhhhh keep it a secret , cause otherwise you'll be wasting your parent's money.
go there today.I won't be going back to the Friendly Thai, at least not for the pad thai. I've never had a pad thai so sickly sweet and watery. There was a wide array of veggies which was a plus, but that could not save this dish. I wouldn't have eaten as much as I did, if I wasn't starving. I tried a bite of a friend's curry pad thai, which had a good savoury curry flavour. This might bring me back there, if I had no other Thai place to go to.Not your typical gelato flavors, but trust me, they are fantastic! The lineup of flavors is making everybody's taste buds go wild! Pear & Gorgonzola, Rosemary & Evo, Rose and a Salmon flavored gelato???  Wow! The flavor combinations taste amazingly good and are right on! 

This shop is located right under the shadows of the Strat. You are bound to run into a friend at any given time. It's a happenin area especially among Yelpers with the arepas place next door and the Goodwich across the way. 

Owner and genius Desyree is daring and not afraid to get creative. It is what makes Desy stand out and sets her gelato apart from other dessert places.  Her gelato is so popular, other restaurants are carrying it.  Oh....Confession time...I really go to Novecento just for the gelato...yes I do. Order pizza and take it home to Mr. B and have salad and Art of Flavors gelato there. Or I drive all the way from Hendo over here now.  It's that good!  I really hope to see more of Desy's gelato creations at more places pretty please!!!

...and that's review #300!

...SYOY in 40 days!Found this place by chance and was pleasantly surprised. Good coffee, excellent breakfast sandwiches. The banana dessert cups.... a great place to plug in and get some work done!I tried the ox tail soup and it was the meaty goodness many have claimed; it was also fat-laden (~$11); it comes w\/ a side of rice.  The graveyard steak dinner was forgettable ($7); it came with a side of fresh green beans and choice of potato.  

The wait around 1 am was about 10 mins; the place was pretty full.  I was seated in Anna's section (taller, slender Caucasian woman with glasses) and she single-handedly made me dislike my dining experience.  It took nearly 40 minutes for her to come take my order and another 40 minutes for her to bring me my lukewarm food.  I'm just glad I twarted the imminent threat of having to waste another extended period of my life to get the check by asking for the check when my food came out.  I love people watching, generally, but not that night; it made me even more annoyed to see all the other servers being keenly attentive and fast and I yearned for Anna to be an iota of that.  Needless to say,  I was ridiculously generous w\/ my rating of two stars; the soup was ok and the poor helpers refilling drinks were helpless in my plight but were on point with their tasks nonetheless.  If I return, I'd ask to be seated in any section NOT covered by Anna.  

Other info: pay at the cashier and not the server, island food and flavors, cheap and filling, ox tail soup, and relaxed\/slow service.For a mediocre joint on the Strip, the prices are ridiculous. If you prefer to stay on the Strip, there are much better choices.The food tasted good, but everything else about dinner tonight was awful. 

The waitress forgot some of our food and didn't bring my order to me the way I asked. After that, she brought us the check and refilled our drinks, but then we never saw her again. After a while I was thirsty enough that I literally got up, went behind the counter and refilled our drinks myself. No one noticed. After about an hour a new waitress came by and offered refills -- leaving our two empty dirty cups on the table but finally removing the dirty dishes. Over the course of more than two hours we were never asked if we wanted to order anything else. To top it off, two of the stalls in the women's restroom were completely out of toilet paper.My fiancé and I took my mom here since she really enjoys the crepes. I had neither been here before nor had I heard of it, but was fine giving it a whirl for my mother.

The only thing I can REALLY remember is that the table was awfully sticky and my server made way more eye contact than was comfortable.

We walked in and I could tell the ambiance they were going for and noticed the "no cell phone" sign. I have to agree with other guests about this policy, on the weekends it's fine, but if it were a weekday I don't think it is reasonable to enforce because of work obligations. I could see asking people to silence their ringer, but a lot of people that go out to lunch during the workday need to have an idea of what's going on when they get back into the office.  The only thing I could think of was that they wanted to turn over tables faster and according to a recent study people on their phones generally take longer to complete a meal.

Anyway, I was a little disappointed they only had their brunch menu available since I really wanted to order a specific salad from the lunch menu I saw online, but alas, I ordered the House Cured Wild-Caught Salmon Omelet off the brunch menu and it tasted like a brick of cream cheese.

It was okay, but the pile of greens with a berry vinegarette didn't really complement the salmon omelet. Also, the salmon omelette had WAY WAY too much cream cheese. I had to open the omelet up to dig some of it out and It almost seemed the extra cream cheese was to cover up the fact that there was a very small amount of salmon in it. I felt ripped off.

My mom's crepes were good, my fiancé's food was forgettable (I can't even remember what he had!) and the service was nice, but to be honest, it was awkward, at least for me.

I am not someone who makes a lot of eye contact, so this may be a personal thing, but I was uncomfortable with how much eye contact she would make when she would ask if I wanted more water. 

I mean...just read your customers a bit better...I felt like she was staring at me a lot and I'd glance up and it was a hard stare.

Overall, I would take my mom here again if she wanted to go, but I wouldn't choose it on my own or recommend it to a group of friends.Astonishingly tacky, bland, and overpriced. Normally I'm down for a good kitschy restaurant but $25 a plate for food I could've made better at home is criminal. We ordered some cocktails from the bar first and the bartender\/server proceeded to literally scream at the tv about how trump was going to fix the economy. He managed to ruin my Moscow mule by pouring it in a glass and clumsily dumped it into the copper cup afterward. It took them nearly thirty minutes to give us bread that wasn't fresh or even toasted. Apps were atrocious, four measly stuffed mushrooms that were mushy and bland and "fresh" calamari that was drowning in balsamic vinegar. House salad was also doused in so much balsamic it was impossible to eat. Food took way too long to come out, I got the linguini: bland and swimming in butter, the (single) scallop wasn't seared and tasted like tofu. My friend got spaghetti and meatballs and it was literally just unseasoned Ragu dumped on a handful of noodles and a single over cooked meatball. Also throughout the night a ten year old Boy Scout was serving us water? A truly baffling experience; this place is a swindle.I cannot begin to express what a wonderful experience we had at Zink tonight. It was the first time we've ever been there and definitely will be returning. Our food was excellent (We both got the filet) and the wine and dessert (Mississippi mud pie) were yummy. Our waiter Dustin was terrific, always making sure we were satisfied. Definitely made for a great date night with my husband.Arpino's is a charming spot, I've dined there now three times and have consistently been impressed with the quality of the dishes - home made tastes better & it shows in their cooking! Call ahead for a reservation, the gracious hosts are sure to accommodate you. I haven't had a meal yet where Steve, the chef, doesn't come and personally ask how your meal was. (PS - It doesn't hurt that its BYOB too!)Amazing hash.   Fresh preserves for the mile high biscuits:)  Great Breakfast off Freemont street.This was by far the worse meal I had during my recent Vegas trip, even taking airport food into account. We had just arrived in Vegas and were absolutely exhausted. It was around 11pm, and we just wanted a quick bite before heading to bed. 

There's a wide selection of food on the menu, but that's probably why the quality was not good at all. It's not even that cheap either. My husband ordered the Western Omelet ($14.99). It was a sad looking omelet with limp looking fries and toast on the side. My husband almost never complains about food and hates to waste anything, but even he didn't enjoy this meal and left quite a lot on his plate. 

I ordered the Mac & Cheese ($14.50). The pasta was a decent al dente, but the cheese sauce was incredibly bland. When I reached for the salt and pepper shakers, I discovered a large wad of tangled hair caught on the opening of the salt shaker. DISGUSTING! The mac was mostly inedible to begin with, and seeing that wad of hair obviously ruined my appetite further. 

After the hair incident, we couldn't wait to get out of this place. They messed up our check and added an extra beer on there. It was a relatively simple fix, but that just dragged things out longer. Ugh.I went into Leo orchid nails for the first time today. The staff were friendly and they did a nice job on my manicure and pedicure. It's easy to write negative and even downright nasty reviews under the anonymity of the Internet. These are hard working small business owners trying to make a living to support themselves and their families which is not easy.This place was a favorite at one time for me. One weekend I went will a group of 4. Everything was good. I'd have to admit the 4 of us maxed out on the all you can eat.  Then I went back a week later this time there was 3 of us. This time there was one huge difference. The staff remembered us from the previous weekend. So our sushi was packed with double the rice. This made it a horrible experience all you could taste was the rice. We said something to the server that there was more rice than last time. She dismissed the claim but did admit to remembering my group. After she walked away she went to the other servers and spoke to them in japenese. Next we could tell they were talking about us. Also I notice the chef was staring at us. I'm 100 percent sure they doubled the rice portion so we wouldn't be able finish so they could charge us extra. That is a shady way to run all you can eat. I will never return.This is the perfect addition to our Fitchburg dining pallet. Authentic Indian quisine in a nicely finished space that offers a blend of charm, class and friendly service.  The vast selection of foods will tickle your taste buds in ways no other local establishment can.  Home made breads, cheeses, curries, desserts and lovely drinks are but a few of the delights here.  This is a vegetarian's haven from their home kitchen!The best thai in the west valley, hands down. Now we just need a good vietnamese place! 

Prices are a little high for what you get, but the quality is what matters. It's a nice quiet place, so its good place to go if you want to talk during dinner.This is what it's all about! Food that fills your mouth and soul with flavors that you didn't know existed. The spaghetti was cooked perfectly! I didn't know spaghetti could taste this fresh and satisfying. Best lasagna ever with the perfect blend of cheeses and whatever else of goodness they put in it. Just ordered tres leches cake and rice pudding for dessert. I can't wait!Poor customer service ruined the entire experience. The coffee was about average, the decor was adorable, but the barista's were so rude that we just took our coffee to go instead of enjoying the ambiance. Won't be recommending this place to others.This is our favorite neighborhood spot to go to! Food is great! The staff is super friendly! The management team does a great job with the staff. Conner is super friendly! We always ask for Jenna to wait on us cause is pays attention to every detail!The food has gone downhill. The Pad Thai bowl was an oversalted soup of noodles and unpleasant unidentifiable solids: tofu? The bowl has 215% of recommended sodium. The tea was supposedly flavored with cinnamon. It had an unpleasant chemical taste. I finished neither. Never again.A group of us came last night before the Hornets game. In One sentence, it is a good thing their food is decent.

The waiter did an okay job, except it was fairly busy for a Wednesday evening, and he was one of the two bartenders. It seemed like the restaurant had a business event going on, and the waiter had lots of drinks to make. He took our order, brought our food, and refilled our drinks once. Speaking of which, the water that he used to refill our original cups with was disgusting- it tasted like it ran through the Sprite line four weeks ago. He never came back around for us to tell him we needed more. In addition, we had to go to him at the bar to get our bill. Again, not necessarily his fault but if management knows they have an event to cater, they should probably get a few more people staffed. 

I used the bathroom, which was dirty with toilet paper everywhere. And there are only two bathrooms, a single women's and single men's. The weird part is that the room is big enough to have at least two stalls, which I found to be a weird decision to have singles in the epicenter. 

At least the food was decent. I had a carne asada quesadilla. Nobody else had complaints about food either. It sucks that the service and atmosphere wasn't great but... oh well. We'll find another place before the next game.I know this is a favorite for many, but I don't know what all the hype is about. Our meals were ok. Nothing memorable or special about anything we tried.Pozole pozole pozole pozole. Pozole pozole pozole. POZOLE!

I say that as a person who loves to eat vegetarian, but the pozole is messed up it's so good. I'll be honest, I've not explored much beyond the pozole on the menu because economically it's hard to justify. This massive bowl of pozole is such a cost-effective deal, full of broth, pork, veggies and goodness, it seems like a waste of money to spend even the same amount on a sandwich, let alone more. I'm sure they're fine, but you get my point.

The fries are okay. Just okay. 

A foodie's tour of Phoenix wouldn't be complete without a bowl of the pozole, and neither would an architect's. The Vig Fillmore is housed in a historic building in downtown Phoenix with a massive patio that actually economizes on its space with room for both seating and play. Speaking of play, there are trivial pursuit cards at all the tables, which can be nice on a busy morning when the service staff is taking a while (This is not a complaint. The place just get's busy because, you know, it's got good food.)

The wine menu here is VERY good, with a selection that rivals some of Phoenix's actual wine bars while also trafficking in better food and lower prices. Their specialty cocktails are also inventive and tasty and the beer selection robust.

tl;dr This place doesn't advertise itself as the place to be, but it really kind of is. It's got a great vibe for hanging out and plenty of reasons to stay a while.the Wicked Spoon is ranked number one out of all Las Vegas Casino buffets, but did not meet the standard of its ranking at all.

the food selection was minimal. they lacked a variety of seafood and sushi, which at Vegas buffet essentials. it consisted mainly of American comfort food, something i can experience somewhere else for a cheaper price. dessert bar only had simple cookies and ice cream. a disappointing experience to say the least.I don't make it here nearly often enough *sigh*...

This place is sooo good!  A friendly fun atmosphere with great great great Neapolitan pizza.  I actually managed to order something other than pizza (a couple of pasta dishes) and that was fabulous!  My parents are not usually fans of Italian food, but even they agreed that Il Pizzaiolo had great food and didn't complain!  :)  The wine flights are also fun and affordable even if not the best wine.

Parking can be a pain at night and on weekends - probably because there is likely to be a line for this place...  try for lunch or an early dinner.The husband and I really liked this place. They are new, so there were a couple kinks they still need to get work out, but that is to be expected. Others have said they didn't like the fact that it was in such a small area, but I really enjoyed that part of it. It made the feel seem much more intimate and the servers more attentive, which was awesome. We took advantage of the 1.50 a plate deal, so we definitely got our money's worth in sushi. The conveyor belt was always full and had quite of varieties available. Loved trying the different kinds they had, and they tasted really fresh, which I loved. I was so wrapped up in eating the food I completely forgot to take photos to show! We will definitely be coming back here and recommending it to others as well.The room smelled musty, bed was saggy in the middle, pillows were lumpy, toilet paper was 1 ply, shower drain was clogged, and ottoman had torn fabric. 

Breakfast at the main restaurant revealed lipstick on my coffee mug, and yellow crust in the cream pitcher. 

The spa also had clogged shower drains and a clogged sink that smelled like rotten eggs. My first massage therapist was hostile and all elbows. Had a second massage which was very good but still not worth the price. 

The grounds are pretty and the pool area is beautiful, and would have been a great place for the kids of they were with me, hence the 2 stars.This was a pleasant surprise . Loud but the food was very good. Lobster bisque was very rich and solid-- a dollop of mashed potatoes sounded weird but cut into the richness of the soup and made it just right.
The swordfish was cooked to perfection and the prime rib was tender and expertly prepared. The strawberry shortcake was yummy too--loved it all !Placed an order and then realized that I have forgotten my wallet at home and didn't have any cash on me.
I immediately cancelled the order and apologized, but....believe it or not, the lady who took my order, offered me the meal for free. Thank you :)Ended up here for lunch.  Place only had 5 other people in restaurant.  I asked for a IPA on tap and the waitress said yes Keith's .  I said I'll have the Lagunitas . She didn't know her beers. Not sure why a sports bar like this hasn't figured out the beer business and fails to have chilled glasses. Wine selection is terrible no California chards very basic Ontario wines.  Not sure why a huge franchise wouldn't have the wine business figured out?? We ordered our food, 25 minutes later waitress came back and said we are out of turkey for the sandwich. We're thinking seriously the place is empty and it took that long to figure that out?  I ordered the cheese burger and it was very good. I said to the waitress when we were done that we are all set.  She failed to understand that lingo twice so I just asked for the bill.I crave the spicy vegetable soup. I would go way more often if it weren't for two things. Thus only 3 stars instead of 5. So please--to the owners\/management: #1. You simply must do something about the terrible freezing draft hitting diners every time the door is opened. It's brutal. #2. Often the choice of music playing is completely inappropriate. How about something more authentic? Please, no more rap, thumping bass, or screeching heavy metal guitars.I had read good reviews already so I was excited to check this place out and they really did exceed my expectations. 

The service was very friendly and helpful. When I asked about the sauces for the wings the next thing I knew the cook was letting me sample all of them to get a good idea of what I wanted (I'm happy to say all were delicious).  

The kitchen is right out in the front and we got to personally talk to the chef and owner who made great recommendations and was an all around great guy. He made us feel so welcome and was clearly enjoying his time cooking. 

I order the baby back ribs with a side of Mac and cheese. The Mac and cheese was so creamy and amazing I would have been happy with just a big bowl of that for dinner. The ribs were fabulous! Smokey and tender, they fell right off the bone. the table offers three of their award winning sauces so you can pick and choose what you want to put on (I personally loved the Carolina gold). 

My boyfriend got the prime rib sandwich with a side of fries and oh dear lord I have never in my life seen a prime rib sandwich like this! It was HUGE!! It was cooked wonderfully and I was a little jealous of his choice (but luckily my ribs were just as amazing). The fries were also wonderful. They had a nice garlic taste to them. 

I would definitely recommend this place to all my friends (which I will be doing) and I will definitely be returning (I'm very excited to try their wings). 

Great barbecue, great atmosphere, great service, great people, great EVERYTHING! Try this place you won't be disappointed.So far we love it! Didn't even make it to the teppanyaki table, but we will be back to try it soon. Started out in the bar with Sake bombs and a roll\/sashimi but it was so good that we decided just to stay & order a couple more rolls. We had the Lisa Lisa Roll, The Texas Roll and the American Dream - sooo good! And the specialty rolls are huge! We couldn't finish, and that doesn't happen often for us. Happy hour looks amazing tooFinally got a chance to try this place after anxiously waiting for them to re-open after their February temporary closure.
It's a very small restaurant and they don't take reservations for 2 people, and it was fully packed that night but luckily we got a table right as we got in. It's a very cozy restaurant and well decorated, with cultural drawings and descriptions all over.
We started off with their tortilla's chips with guacamole. This consisted of blue corn chips that tasted homemade for sure. They were so good! The texture was firm, the taste of corn stood out, and they weren't greasy at all.
My friend and I ended up getting the vegetarian quesadilla's. The way they make their quesadilla's are different from any other place, since their version is basically a larger version of a taco. I definitely prefer this version more as it allowed me to try different options rather than the typical quesadilla's which are so large that you can only order one kind. Also, this way there is more filling inside and less greasiness that would result from cooking it on a skillet.
I chose 3 different types: roasted pepper, mushroom, and cactus. I chose to have the first 2 without cheese. This was served with a tiny amount of refried beans (which I wish was a larger serving size) and a small side of salad. My first bit literally got me speechless! The cactus one was amazing! Which may be due to the cheese. But the mushroom one, despite not even containing cheese was the best! I don't know how they made it so flavourful! But the highlight of it all was the tortilla. That fresh corn taste is unbeatable. 
This is what you would call an authentic Mexican restaurant. There are no football sized burritos, hard taco shells, and foods doused in cheese! 
After this experience I ended up back there the following weekend...it's pretty addictive! So far this would be the best Mexican restaurant I have ever been to. Worth going for sure!The sushi is pretty average but the chinese food is subpar, my biggest rant is their "server".  I've tried this place a few times and it's been the same girl, not only does she not have knowledge of what she's presenting but we have to ask anytime we want some kind of service. Tonight was the kicker, I saw her picking her teeth with her hand, how was I suppose to ask her for anything else after that. Disgusting!The food is great. have eaten there almost every month for the last year.  I really don't like the fluorescent lighting though. thats the only thing I would change.I thought this place had a very stellar atmosphere for watching the initial rounds of the NCAA tournament.  I actually went there twice in the same day and was very pleased with the food, drinks, service and overall experience.  I will be stopping by there again when I am in Charlotte for business.Who knew that the people working here were paid to make fun of those who didn't speak french? 
I certainly didn't when I stopped in to order some food on a regular Friday night. 

To management: I hope you seriously take a look at who you hire in the future.  Even though I don't speak french, my friend certainly did, and didn't appreciate how your staff rudely made fun of me for not speaking it. They're paid to do their job, take orders, and make food, not give their opinions on their customers. 

To future customers: spend your money elsewhere unless you want to be rudely berated. An absolutely disgusting example of montreal customer service. 

So glad I didn't end up spending money here after they insulted me. I will never spend money at another amir restaurant ever again.I was super impressed with this place. They cut the meat and cheese just for your order. It's not that meat that has been sitting out in a bin all day either. The 12 inch was enough food to fill me up and it tasted great.

I have found a new home to go get my subs.Amazing food!! You can definitively taste the quality, creativity, and passion in each bite. Everything was delicious! The fries are double fried and taste like heaven. The burger is made with butter dipped bread and melts in your mouth. The bariyani was food for the soul, and definitely will leave you full to the brim. We can't wait to come back and try everything on the menu :)We love it here. Yup, nuff said. 

Fried pickles, L'Gros Luxe Poutine, Fish Tacos = happiness.

Great variety of cocktails + Draft Beers.

Fauna: from students, to couples, to guys that the only thing that they picked - up the last year(s) was a cold and try to get attention by being super loud. Get a grip dudes can't attract the ladies this way.

Of course we shall be back. We love it here!!I was starving when me and my friend got here. It was just the two of us and they told us it'd be an hour wait. They ended up seating us a little earlier. Our food came out super fast which was nice. I ordered the yardburger and my friend got the 3 cheese one. I also got the Oreo creme brulee shake and we split the truffle parmasean fries. Basically after finishing only about a quarter of our food we decided we should have just split one burger because they are huge and skipped the fries. Overall everything was delicious and totally worth the price but I ended up getting sick afterwards. Not sure if it was because I ate it super fast or the quality of the food itself.Yummy Ethiopian food. The portions seemed a bit small for the price though. Otherwise, I preferred the decor and ambiance of Lalibela over the Rendez-Vous. The staff were also more friendly.I'm a huge Chipotle fan but this location is just so-so.  I generally order ahead via their mobile app and the last time I ordered from here the food wasn't ready by the time that I got there.  They hadn't even actually started to make it.  There was hardly anyone in the line for a Friday afternoon and they told me there would be a wait for my food.  I could've gotten into the line and had my food quicker.  I asked them to just cancel my order and give me my money back.  They obliged and that was that.  Very weird situation.  The parking situation here is awful.  Their parking lot has less than 10 spots and there are people constantly circling around the lot trying to find a spot.  It's easier to just park on the road in one of the 3 metered spots in front of the Pep Boys across the street.I have some mixed reviews on this This Rocaberry. On the plus side it is in a great location with nice outdoor seating outside for the summer and the staff is always friendly and efficient But I do find that this Rocaberry location is not up to par with some of the others I have been to. They have limited indoor seating which is not horrible since you usually don't end up waiting too long for a seat. However , the main reason I feel like this location isn't my favourite is actually because of the pies themselves :( the last few times I went the pie did not seem as fresh as it should be , the flavour was off and the food was mediocre. I realize this is a chain but i have had much better quality of food and desserts at their saint Leonard branch for example. If you are going to the Monkland location i would steer clear of the pies and opt more for the cheesecakes. that's just my opinion though and I hope i just had some bad luck when I went in.Went in before a Pens-Isles game and it was incredibly packed.  They seemed to handle the rush pretty well though.  We were seated in 25 minutes which for the time arrived wasn't a bad wait time.  It's definitely got a hockey feel to it, but a higher end atmosphere as well.  Food was great and we got in and out in enough time to catch the puck drop.Solid service. Cozy little hole in the wall. The guys here are very courteous and polite. I had a quick lunch. For $5.99 I got a MONSTER slice and a coke. Great place!!!My wife and I just came for our second time and have been more than pleased both times. The "TWC Style" dry rub is definitely a winner. I ordered a 6 pc combo of all drumsticks and they were absolutely perfect. Seasoning was very tasty but not to the point where it's overpowering. 

As if the perfectly cooked\/seasoned wings weren't enough, they offer seasoned fries which we ordered both times and they are quite delicious. Fries were an awesome combination of crispy yet still soft in the center. 

The only reason I didn't commit to the full 5 stars is due to the fact that when we came tonight, about 45 minutes to closing time, it seemed like they put less effort into it. My wife ordered the sweet potato fries and we had to wait for a second batch to be made because they burnt the first set. The second batch were also on the burnt side but since we love the vibe and the food is still amazing, we weren't about to complain. Overall, this place puts wingstop to bed and that's saying a lot. Well done TWC, well done.This location has the worse customer service ever.   We order 55 dollars worth of food and when  it was come to leave I asked to have a take out box and a stupid want to be cook told Me he could not give me one.  How the heck are you suppose to take 3 tacos home, if you Oder the food for eating in.  He put an argument with me and did not give me a container.   I can tell you this idiot just lost a good customer and screw their tip, because the 10 dollars I was going to leave them am handing it to the homeless outside.

Food is stupid expensive and not all that with the type of service they definably won't see me again ...Really good breakfast. Lots of food.  Very nice waitress. Bright fun restaurant. Loved the s'more pancakes.This place used to be a favorite.  The food is very good but the portions are rather small for the price.  I'm all about presentation but don't comprise the size of the meal so much just to make it pretty.  Their lobster pot pie used to be huge and look like an actual pot pie with tons of veggies and lobster but the "updated" version is a quarter of the size and looks nothing like a pot pie.  It is simply a piece of lobster tail with a tiny pastry puff on top and no more than ten pea size carrots and potatoes, for 40 bucks!! Don't get me wrong, It is a great spot and the food is delicious but I think they need to increase portion size or lower their prices a little.Both my wife and I are big fans of Brandon Chrostowski and all that he is trying to accomplish with his "Pay It Forward" concepts and programs.  We've followed him from L'Albatros to Edwins and now on to Serenite.  We were a bit delayed in celebrating our anniversary this year (it is in August!), but agreed that this was the right spot to try and celebrate it in style.

The staff and service were delightful, attentive and helpful. The restaurant manager came over to greet us during a lull, and ended up helping my wife choose a bottle of wine to go with our expected meal selections.  It turned out to be an excellent choice!

The meal started off with a basket of complimentary (warm) bread and butter while we sipped our wine.  That was followed shortly by a side salad we chose to split.  The salad with sherry-hazelnut vinaigrette was light and bitey (due to the dressing).

Next, the main dishes came out.  The moules frites I ordered had the mussels (in a white wine butter sauce) served separately from the crispy fries.  No matter, I dipped when necessary.  The portion size of this dish was outrageous!  Not sure I've ever seen that many mussels on a plate, but could not stop eating them drenched in that delicious buttery sauce.

My wife's hanger steak was cooked a perfect medium-rare and the Diane sauce (demi-glace with mushrooms, brandy and cream) was divine.  She ordered the French mac-n-cheese as her side, and with its fontina and vacherin cheeses it was one of the best "adult" varieties we'd ever had.

For dessert, we shared two dishes...the bananas foster (made table side) and the beignets with a trio of dipping sauces (caramel, chocolate and raspberry coulis).  My wife thought the bananas foster was better than any we'd had in New Orleans, and the production put on to make them in front of you is fun and interesting to watch.  The beignets themselves were on the small side, but they were served warm with plenty of powdered sugar.  As for the dipping sauces, go with the raspberry coulis.  Going in I would have said either the caramel or chocolate, but the tartness of the raspberries pairs so well with those fried pillows of goodness.  Yum yum!!!

After the meal, they even brought us each out a small glass of Prosecco (with a candle attached to each) in celebration of our (belated) anniversary.  It was a lovely touch.

I am hopeful that Serenite continues to do great things (inside and out of the restaurant) and word spreads so that they continue to thrive.  Keep up the good work, team!Happy hour is amazing...but honestly at full price dinner and drinks here are still a bargain anybody that disagrees is a negative yelper and refuses to be happy to pay for quality, the passion behind the bar menu and behind the bar itself is rare to see with such little spotlight or reward....they have one goal and that to impress and make you happy mission accomplished...the first bartender we had was probly my favorite he had moved here from California...and his on the spot mixology based on flavor and spirit preference was rare nowadays...I haven't seen him since not sure if he is still there or have just missed his shiftsRecommended from a friend in Houston , a great affordable  place to take friends or family. Smaller boutique restaurant that would also make for a great pick-up Togo spot, and not break the bank.Hella unorganized. I totally understand you just opened last week but with a rush that I experienced I would think there would be some organization.

My banana' foster sundae was a total fail. More soup then ice cream.- Sodium is through the roof just the ingredients themselves. Opt to add the sauces by yourself at the condiments station (instead of by the staff).

- Seating is seriously limited. Come before 11am and 5pm if you want a seat at all. 

- the height of the tables is not conducive for toddlers sitting through your meals. Easier to take meals home. They do have high chairs if you are early enough to get a dinner-table height seat. The interior design of this establishment had adults in mind. 

+ I got my toddler to consume a lot of veggies here. I ask for all sides that's not spicy. They are delicious. Partly due to the saltiness. 

+ It's fast and furious. Chipotle style.Food here is really good. Is it ALL THE HYPE good; no... not really. Nothing wrong with it either just really good and a little pricey for lunch. @ 20.00 for a sandwich, cola, and tip most can't do this everyday.

That said the service was good, prompt and polite. The food; well far too much of it. I brought enough back to the office for AT LEAST one more lunch. With this in mind the price is not too bad but it depends if you want a reheated sandwich for lunch the next day? I am not into beer but it looked as if they had every brew made on the planet in this place so for many this will be heaven!We have been frequent customers for four years, quality & service great every time.  You must try Miang Kum, outstanding appetizer.  Muay outstanding part of management team, Nick could not have been attentive.We asked the hotel concierge for the restaurant recommendation and the first name that came out of his mouth was L'Express. He kindly made a reservation for us even though it was for 10pm...but we were glad we had the reservation because the place was packed even at 10pm!!  Loved the ambiance, very Parisien classic bistro with cute checkerboard floor minus snobbish and arrogant Parisien attitude. Even if you don't speak le Français there's no need to feel intimidated because the waiters here are bilingual and friendly. 

The food here was pretty good! You can try various Quebecoise fromages which were high quality, highly recommended!!! The complimentary pickles in the jar were very good. Both steak tartar and hanger steak were pretty good overall, but I've had better hanger steaks in NY. The chocolate cake I had for dessert was soooo rich, I mean, it was like eating a big chunk of truffle! 

Food:B+\/A-
Service:A
Ambiance:A-I cannot even begin to explain my love for Angry Crab. When we first pulled up (our very first night), I can admit that I was slightly scared of the ambiance. However, my boyfriend (who is from the south) could not suppress his excitement for the food we were about to eat. The walls are covered in sharpie graffiti, LSU decorations adorn the walls, and butcher paper and no utensils are on the table. To say I was intimidated is an understatement. Jeff (the best server I have ever experienced at any restaurant ever) calmed our fears quickly. With his outgoing personality, customer service orientation, and thoughtful explanation and recommendation, Jeff helped us to order our food. The food is beyond amazing. It is so beyond worth the price. My boyfriend loves that they have live crawfish to boil! 

We continually come back to Angry Crab for date night. Our favorite nights are even when Jeff is our server! If it hadn't been for him that first night, we never would have come back for our 5+ time. I tell everyone about Angry Crab (and my experience with Jeff)! My parents even celebrated their 25th wedding anniversary here on my recommendation! 

Thanks Jeff and Angry Crab for helping Daulton and I find a restaurant that reminds him of home and tastes so good!I had a gathering with friends at this cafe. In fact, I found this cafe on Yelp first. There were two stories for this cafe. There were a few small tables on the first floor and also there were two transparent windows displaying the sweets and cakes as well as other treats. On the second floor, there were a few larger tables with a few small tables. I sat on the second floor and I felt it was more cozier to sit on the second floor. 

I ordered a piece of pistachio pineapple cake and a glass of mocha. I was astonished to see the large piece of pistachio pineapple cake that I had ordered. It looked like I was given a quarter of the cake. The slice of cake was nicely decorated with white chocolate flower on top with pistachio green on the surface of the cake. I could taste the pistachio and the refreshing pineapples inside the cake. The only negative factor I would say is the cake is a bit too sweet.

When the cup of Mocha came, I could see the multiple layers of the coffee, white, light brown and dark brown. Again, the presentation was elegant. The waitress gave me sugar on the side in case I need it. It's sweet enough and it tastes delicious.


 withoutTried the combo and had to return for seconds on the belly pork bao. It was that good. The sesame noodle was also great. Will definitely return. The owners were both so friendly and helpful.Came here with my husband for dinner. We usually come to this location when we have a taste for steak. Food is always consistently tasty. Staff always friendly. Never had an issue here and the managers usually walk around to each table and introduce themselves. We really like the quality of this location and their great customer service.Stopped by here for an early dinner on a Saturday around 5pm.  There was a nice amount of people watching TV, chatting and playing pool.  It's a clean divey bar with fantastic service and food.  The shrimp and fish basket was so fresh and tasty and the server confirmed it was swimming in Rocky Point recently.  Can't beat that for seafood in Phoenix!!  My chicken, avocado, bacon sandwich was awesome and the chili wings were meaty (actually quite huge!) and tasted great.  We'll definitely be back!Love love love their House Special Oysters! Will go to District One just to order those! Good vibe, friendly service, nice take on Asian flavors.Amazing selection of South African goodies...good prices,  great service, amazing people!The service was exemplary and fast, the food was to die for my favorite was the créme caramel, there was nice soothing music playing, and the decor was quant and peaceful, all around a nice place to eat and I would dine again...I've been eating at this ayce location for a few times now. The reason is because the price is reasonable and their Hamachi kama is really good. Their sushi is ok to me. The tend to add more rice on the second time around when you order. I love their salmon belly but sometimes they are out. It's not bad for the price of ayce. I would suggest they should be consistent with the rice instead of adding way too much. It should be proportionate.As the others have stated, this place is great!!! The ingredients are fresh, the portions large, and the prices reasonable. The next time I order the Pad Thai I'll request it be made a bit less sweet and have them add some chili sauce for some "bite" as I'm used to having it less sweet and a bit spicy. Every order is cooked-up fresh so special requests aren't a problem.Bomb ass donuts, get there early otherwise the different options and the best ones go fast.The chicken protein plate is delicious. I got half quinoa and half sweet potato hash. Very delicious. Nice patio friendly staff. Lots of healthy options including protein drinks and fresh juicesNEVER coming back to eat here!!!
Hope the $13.75 is worth my monthly business and a bad review. 

Told her I wanted Phô Xâo Dón Thâp Câm which I've had at different Vietnamese restaurant. She pointed at #79-Phô Áp Châo Thâp Cám. I asked specifically if noodles are flat and cut in squares. She mutters, "It's same..same thing". Okay I'll get it. 10minutes later guy comes and drops it off at table and leaves. I waved at guy to tell him it's not the same noodles that I wanted. He said, u ordered #79! Yes but only bc she said it was same thing....And it's not! He then tried to explain that every place makes it different. Okay I understand that so don't tell me it's same thing if it's NOT, right? Well immediately I said, "can I see the menu I want something else."!He continues trying to explain and wasn't taking it off my bill bc "I ordered it". I finally said fine do whatever charge me but I don't want it.  I ordered #70. It was okay(5.5\/10), definitely had better at other places. 
Now that I've read few other 1star reviews on here, 200% I will NOT ever eat here!!! It was on dirty dining for demerits, Yelper witnessed employees not washing hands, Yelper had hair and bug found in their food! Plus you raised the prices on menu I noticed. 

Here's my $13.75 of advertising for u!!!The Best pizza in town. They're always consistent in their product is always great. The staff there is always on top of things. There are other food is also good great environmentre:  dinner

This place is as consistent as any other In-N-Out with less of a wait.  It's a little off the strip, so if you do not have a vehicle if visiting Vegas, it would make it tough to eat here.  If there's such thing as Quality Fast Food, this is it.  *cheers*Exceptional service and good vegetarian options. The concept of having different types of Asian food is great so that you can please a variety of tastes. I would definitely return and recommend that others pay a visit for dinner - the restaurant was not at all busy on a Friday but provided an exceptional dining experience.

The Thai curry was nice and spicy, the avocado sushi and veggie rolls were super fresh, and the Thai noodles (Pad Thai and Pad See Ew) were well seasoned. Our water glasses were never empty, and the service was very friendly from our seating through the end of the meal.Exactly what you want from a Cracker Barrel. Hot, fresh food. Quick and friendly service. A very nice addition for Las Vegas.Hands down, the best buffet I have ever, ever, ever been to. The selection, the quality of food, the freshness, the delivery, the service, everything. Food was much higher quality than I ever would have expected from a buffet. Amazing. As with everything at the Wynn\/Encore, nothing dissapointed. Can't wait to go back.Food was so delicious! We were first timers.. the place gets busy. Food served quickly! We need one in hawaii! I would return and highly recommend this place !This is just for the food court and just for the older women who work behind the counter. I have been coming here for years, I love this place. Unfortunately the last 5 times or so I have come these ladies have been working and they always mess up the order and take forever even when no one is in line. If you ask for fresh avocado with your food they give you a green salsa. I have even seen one of them wearing gloves that were all torn up and her fingers sticking out making food. Can you please train them on food safety and how to take a order and get it right without taking 20 min to do so.Stopped here for breakfast on the way back to SoCal. Greeted promptly, nice and friendly service. They have a lunch and breakfast menu. There is no breakfast menu for kids but they will make a kids size portion. Daughter went with funfetti pancakes, topped off with whipped cream and infused with sprinkles. The boy had the same chocolate chip pancakes as always. Wife went with French toast. I had the beer pancakes. They were amazing, made with Guinness and full of smoked apple wood bacon. Out of this world delicious! I could barely eat half the order. Added the combo to it for $3 more which included two eggs and choice of sausage, bacon, etc. I will warn you now. You may end up in a food coma. I did not eat the rest of the day. Happy eating!Cool bar. Drinks are reasonably priced. My vodka could have been a tad stronger but it was good. They have a huge outside area with multiple activities such as cornhole, etc.  all in all a good time.This is my favorite place for Tortas. Everything I have had there has been excellent. So far my favorite is the torta ahogada which is in a pool of tomato and Chile sauce.  That is alone is worth coming to it check out. They also seem to use a large amount of fresh avocado in their tortas (literally they cut them there fresh and on the spot) 

Also they sometimes give you samples of the soups, and let me tell you they have some great ones. I'm not sure what this soup was called but it was a corn cream based style, and was literally one of the best soups I have ever tasted. They also have a fantastic Mango aqua fresca which is out of this world. I don't write many reviews on yelp as much as I use it for a resource, but this place I did because I really enjoy it. The service has also always been excellent. 

 I can't speak for any other items on the menu other then the tortas, soups, and the mango fresca so take this review based on those.I must say, I am a fan of many different styles of Indian cuisine. I have tried several of the Indian restaurants in Phoenix, Tempe and two in Gilbert.

Chennai Chettinaad is by far better than the places I've gone. They are the most consistent, with the best variety of dishes than the others. The authenticity of their dishes is top of their class. And when I say their Fish Curry is OUTSTANDING, it is an understatement. It is ridiculously amazing.This soul food restaurant just open about three months ago in my neighborhood. I just tried it tonight and it was absolutely fabulous!! The greens were so yummy the mac & cheese was good and the catfish was so tender and lightly crispy. I recommend it to everybody!!! The Fry Guy highly recommended when you have a taste for some good soul food! So glad it's soo close to me!!This place is delicious! I had a breakfast burrito with black beans, mushrooms, eggs and cheese and fresh salsa on the side! I also had a prickly pear tea and a almond milk latte both were on point! The second time I dined in and had a big salad and a wrap that were also yummy! I love that they have a drive through. I wish they were open later in the day. For a quick healthy bite to eat I definitely recommend this place. My only negative would be one of the staff members she has been there both times I have been there, she mumbles and doesn't really smile.... if you don't like people, don't work in customer service! All the other staff was great! I can't fault them for one bad tomato!My wife and her family have been coming here for many years now, and now I'm hooked. If you like Vietnamese, you'll love this place.

What I regularly order is the beef or pork vermicelli with spring rolls. The meat is well seasoned, and the handmade spring rolls provide the satisfying crunch to the meal.

Another thing I order, which isn't on the menu BTW, is the lemon chicken. It is amazing. Deep fried chicken pieces (don't worry, not the frozen crap) surrounded by a wonderfully gooey lemon\/lime sauce. I get it with a side of noodles. Great on its own, or as a item to share with the table.

For drinks, I usually only have their green tea. Their iced coffee is good, as well as their mango milkshake.

Everything is well priced. The place is clean, service is prompt, and its never empty. I highly recommend!I went here for dinner and was very disappointed. I have been craving Indian food for a while and decided to go for a chicken tikki dish. What I got was a chicken fajita on a hot plate with onions, bell peppers, carrots. Then a separate bowl of bland sauce-the same sauce that my companion got on her bland food. For $14, I would have at least expected a tortilla to go with it. The naan was really salty and buttery. I also ordered garlic naan and got what even the waiter called "garlic bread". The only good thing was the mango lassi. I wish I could be more positive, but I've had better fast food Indian in strip malls.I ordered the green curry. I was pleasantly surprised that sauce was pretty on point. Although the chunks of chicken and veggies were way too big.  Made it very hard to eat.  The portion size was large, great for leftovers. For a "fast food" Thai joint...it was much better than expected.  Although I prefer authentic, this place isn't too shabbyIt's always been DD for me, but I tried The Donut Shop donuts and couldn't believe how good they are! I'll go back!Went here for dinner last Friday to celebrate a friend's birthday. Being that our group was large (18) and the private dining room was already booked, we were seated in the patio area. (Luckily the weather was nice around 8p.m.) Roka Akor is a beautiful restaurant, from the inside out.

I ordered the Unagi ($8.50), Uni sashimi ($13.00), Yellowtail sashimi ($8.00), and two of their blood orange margaritas ($10 each). When they brought out my order, all I could think was "wow!" (See pics)

The Unagi (freshwater eel), Uni (sea urchin) and Yellowtail looked and tasted fresh - the Uni melted in my mouth (yum). 

The blood orange margaritas were strong and DELICIOUS and were served in tall glasses (looks sort of like champagne flutes) - the red from the blood orange added a nice pop of color (very elegant looking). The restaurant gets top points for presentation. 

This is a great spot for a date, but I wouldn't recommend sitting in the patio area if you're looking for romantic ambiance.

Service is here top-notch, which is very important if one is going to be paying premium prices for food. Our waitress was very knowledgeable, friendly and prompt. 

I'd definitely dine here again.

Btw - there is free valet and self-parking.Since I just wrote a horrible review for another Starbucks, I feel the need to point out an excellent location. My drinks are always great from this location and the service is always friendly. It is worth the extra time to drive to this location and even worth going in (they don't have a drive thru) to get a drink made with love. Thank you to everyone who has ever made my drink here. You guys rock.This is one of my favorite breakfast places in Vegas. 

The food is great, service is quick and they have good coffee. A little speedy, but it's a trendy breakfast place so you have to expect that. 

I love the sausage and any egg dish with that in it I'm happy. I always opt for the coffee cake which is making my mouth drool just thinking about that sweet goodness. 

Coffee is great there and the staff keeps me full. I think even Mr. Pink would tip. 

Great place, highly recommended.I'm not sure why we went here. Probably because it was half price night. Oh yeah, yes... that's pretty much the only reason. 

They didn't even have maguro. Seriously? They conveniently "ran out". 

Oh, and also -- their bartenders don't know their product. At all. My cousin was trying to order 2 beers. The conversation went something like this:
cuz: "do you have that Japanese stout? I can't remember the name but I know it's made by Rogue."
bartender boy: "you want a SNOUT?"
cuz:  " ........... no. I said STOUT. really?!" 

Snout. Yes. That really happened. How does a bartender not know what a stout is? Bizarre. 

Bleh.Whenever I'm craving a burger, I stop by Bobby's Burger Palace during my lunch break. The service is always fast, friendly and the food is quite tasty. It's located right in front of Aria and Waldorf Astoria off the strip. Your best bet is to park at Aria, get a quick bite to eat and then leave since you can get free parking if you leave under an hour. The seating here is set up with communal tables but the tables kind of curve a bit so it doesn't feel like you're so close to the strangers around you. 

My go to burger is always the L.A. Burger. I love the avocado relish that comes on the burger and I ALWAYS get my burgers "Crunchified" which means they add potato chips in your burger. The only other burger I have tried was the Philly Burger, which is basically their version of a philly cheesesteak, and is also great. I also like to compliment my burgers with sweet potato fries. It comes with this amazing honey mustard-horseradish sauce, which is sweet with a nice little kick to it. If you can't make up your mind, they also have "The Undecided", which I usually get mixed with the sweet potato fries and onion rings. 

I have also tried their Pistachio milkshake which is really delicious. I've never had the opportunity but you can spike it with a shot of vodka, rum or bourbon for an extra $5. If you can't decide between the burgers or milkshake flavors on the menu, you can always ask what the "Flavors of the Month" are to try something new.

Also, make sure you get your loyalty BBP card so you can start racking up points towards free food!Very happy with our visit. Love the many gluten free options! I will be back. The tomato soup and chicken salad were my favs. I will want to try more as well. Also very friendly and helpful.Well fuck. I usually rant about asian places.. but this place was on top of their fucking game tonight. Water refills CONSTANTLY. Usually they stingy and shit about their h2o. Not water deprived at all!! Even the sushi was good. They constantly came around asking how we were doing. And the food came out fast. Bathroom was suprisingly clean too. For an east side native I give this place 5 stars fuck all my friends who don't like this place!!! #eastsideIt has already been about two months since I came to Ginko. I have been tweeting too much. Yelp is no longer my only outlet of weirdness. I came for the happy hour by myself and was treated extremely well by the staff. Dante was down in the basement and seemed to be a really friendly guy. I always stick with basic sushi pieces and don't venture into shelled creatures or things like that. The atmosphere was great and the food was also. I enjoyed eating in the dark basement. I have been talking about this place ever since early June and I need to go back.I have been to Little Italy a handful of times and every time I end up here...but I'm not complaining! 

The first time I came, we only ordered drinks. They were pretty good. I had some sort of berry lemonade concoction - very sweet, but delicious. 

I always order the cheese tortellini - I can't help myself. It is amazing. The sauce is perfect-slightly spicy and creamy. Add in pasta with cheese, peas and prosciutto and you have an incredible dish. I want to try something else every time I come, but I never do.

Make a mental note: you have to ask for bread!! Who doesn't always want bread?

I have also tasted the baked veggies dish with sausage and it has a great smokey flavor to it. I've tasted the eggplant parmesan and it's very good also.

My last visit, the service was a little slow and our waiter was only to been seen a few times but that wouldn't stop me from coming back.

This is definitely a great spot in Little Italy.Don't hate me. Please? I've been wanting to love Defalcos for decades. I just...don't. Their marinara is too sweet for me, and their meatballs are mushy and one dimensional and ABSURDLY SALTY. I've got a better place to go for a meatball sub to cry for.
This check-in we got the eggplant parm, the meatball sub, the seafood salad and a basil, tomato, and mozzarella salad, and a chocolate connoli for dessert. 
The eggplant parm was TERRIBLE! Underseasoned, and it tasted like the oil it was cooked in wasn't hot enough. It was frankly, kind of gross.  Major bummer! I ate 2 small bites aqnd was sorry that I ate the second bite..
The meatball sub was underwhelming and just as icky as always.  I've learned my lesson.  Never again.
The seafood salad was delicious!  Loads of dill, you could actually taste the shrimp and crab.  Totally fabulous!!!!
The cannoli? NEVER NEVER NEVER again.The chocolate coating tasted chemically.  Their regular cannoli are nice though.  Too bad we didn't get one.   

On the plus side, their breads are all delicious, the grocery store is awesome, the wines extensive and inexpensive, and the seafood salad is the shiznit! Overall, a solid 3 stars.

We've learned our lesson.  Next time we go,  We're getting 2 glasses of wine, 2 orders of seafood salad, splitting one of their COLD SUBS, and getting a regular cannoli.
BTW:  I almost forgot.  We do love their garlic bread.  :)

UPDATE: The owner sent me an extremely polite e-mail.  We have decided to give the eggplant parm another try on another day and I will bring my mom.  She is an eggplant fanatic and eggplant parm may be her favorite food.  We will update y'all when we go.The service was prompt and the food was great. The wings were cooked perfectly and their homemade ranch was finger licking good.We went to CC tonight to celebrate my daughter's birthday. As soon as we got there it was chaos. Hostesses were not very friendly and didn't greet us for several minutes. We were seated at the round tables near the back and it had terrible lighting. Half the table was lit from a single bulb above and the other half was completely dark. Water droplets were also dripping on our table from above. 

Service was also mediocre. Our server was 'nice' but didn't practice proper server etiquette. When our salads were done, he asked us to pass him our plates instead of moving around the table and doing it himself. When our salads and dinner came, he never came around to ask if we'd like fresh pepper or how our meal was. 

When it came time for my daughter's 'happy birthday' moment, he simply came by and put the cake in front of her and left.  How disappointing!!!! 

Anyway, it's all gone downhill and I won't go back. So sad, since it used to be one of my favourites.Sighhhhhh.  My wife has been wanting to dine at Aureole for quite some time so I finally obliged her and made a reservation.  Sadly for the restaurant, I'm not sure we even needed the res, and it was a Friday night.

Bread - 3 options, Rosemary, Pretzel, and (i forget the third, didn't try it).  The Rosemary was warm, fluffy, and worth a second go around.  If you've dined out at all in the last 12-18 months you probably have noticed that pretzel bread is all the rage and can be found almost anywhere.  Unfortunately, it really misses the mark here.  Maybe we were just unlucky, but the bread was room temp and fairly dry.

Apps - Here is where a little disappointment grew.  If you attempt to check out Aureole online, you will find a much different menu than what you will find in person.  I had my heart set on a shrimp scampi app prior to coming but soon found it was not available.  I was torn between two options and went with the French Onion Soup based on the waiters recommendation.  I'd say it was average, better than what you might get at a chain restaurant but not the best I've had.  My wife went with the crab risotto which was more pricey but also hearty and rich.  I would recommend it as an app to split because I think like my wife, most women would give up on the dish before finishing it.

Entrees - If you don't have an extra large appetite, the ahi tuna and scallop entree is a good option.  The tuna was high quality and cooked rare.  The scallops were also cooked perfectly and I enjoyed the spice level of the dish.  However, the portion is not very large so if your stomach is growling, you might feel like this entree is more like an appetizer.  My wife went with a lamb chop special which was nice.  The chops were fairly large in size and cooked perfectly.  Overall, she was happy with her selection and it was plenty of food for her.

Dessert - We went with the chocolate trio which is nice because it is like 3 desserts in one and is perfect for two people to split.  The fondue was my favorite of the three but the donut was not as good as a similar option we always get at Scarpetta.  Also, I forget what the middle option was called but it came with some coated bacon strips.  I think added a salty element (especially bacon) is also a very "in" think to do with desserts now, but the bacon here just amount to a hassle.  After only one bite it just stuck to all my teeth and was pretty annoying.

Lastly, our service wasn't bad or slow but Jerry Seinfeld might describe our waiter as a "low talker."  Eventually I just gave up listening to his recommendations because I couldn't hear a word he was saying.

All in all Aureole was okay, but nothing struck me as unique or superior to the many similar options in Vegas, so I can't say I would prefer to come back versus trying somewhere new.The staff was very nice. The nachos are amazing. We ordered fish tacos, they were horrible. The fish was over cooked and the tortillas were hard. My husband ordered chicken with gravy and eggs, the biscuits were hard as a rock, eggs over cooked, little to no gravy. Bloody Mary's were ok. Again the staff was very friendly.Best service. Carpaccio was great, skirt steak was great too. Side dishes were wonderful. Mac and cheese with truffle, lobster mashBest BBQ I've ever had. On the same level as Phil's BBQ in San Diego... don't mind the lines, service is fast and the line moves quick. I love the way they lay out drinks before you order. They have 312 and IBC in stock, AWESOME!

The 1\/2lb ordering system takes some getting used to. In my opinion, 1\/2lb of ribs\/prime rib is not enough for most men. Order a pound, don't be a wuss. The 1\/2lb of brisket is plenty, however. Perfect amount of food. 

Only side I have tried so far was coleslaw and it was meh. Plain, boring. Would not order again... but considering how great everything else is (including the service!) I won't dock any stars :)

The moist brisket is the thing to try first, it will sell you on this place! I can't wait to go back and try the chicken and corn on the cobb (you get a whole cobb!).AWESOME CRAB LEGS!! we came on a thursday night, got in quickly, and had the best crab legs ive ever had! and bomb lobster mac n cheese!! they give you a great quantity of crab legs a full meal. and our server Genaro was fantastic!  we had a lovely little date night experience, and dont forget the mango mojito!! just go here!Boy, oh boy. Wolfgang Puck, me likey! 

I got to experience CUT for the first time during my past Vegas trip (May 2013). It's tucked inside the Palazzo near the casino and shops leading to the Venetian. Step through the doors and you're transported into a very friendly, contemporary and modern atmosphere, which I loved. 

I had reservations, which I strongly suggest, so there was no waiting to being seated at our table. The inside decor is very modern and sheik. The ambiance and lighting are very on par with what I would expect to this type of restaurant. 

After being seated, you get to peruse their menu and look at the options you have for appetizers and entrees. You can also order drinks via iPad when your server gets to you. Your server also brings out a giant platter and explains the cuts and types of steak that you can order! Very informative!

Shortly after ordering, the bread platters are brought around and you're asked which types you want. Being the fatty that I am, I asked to sample all of available breads.. heheh. My favorite was the cheesey bread! Eat as much as you want. 

Now onto the star of the show.. the steak. Oh wait, a very honorable mention goes to the supporting star, the bone marrow flan. What a perfect medley of flavor and texture to make this appetizer definitely a must try if you come here!

For steak, we opted for the American Wagyu, one rib eye and one sirloin. Both were cooked and served close to perfection. Definitely one of the best steaks I've ever had in my life. The crust\/sear on the steak was great and the flavor and doneness inside was amahhhzing. I would definitely recommend this type and cut of steak.

Overall, the ambiance, amazing food and superb service match the price tag that comes with CUT. For just two people, the bill altogether (with tip and tax) came out to nearly $300. No drinks were had that night too, mind you. But definitely an experience and meal to remember. and hey, you're in VEGAS! Go big or just go home already.

(FYI. If you choose\/ask for 'still' water, they serve you VOSS water. Each bottle costs $9, mind you. That was an unexpected surprise when the bill came..)Update: We finally had the chance to actually dine in. I've tried to get reservations, but there's never availability. We decided to drop in around 6:30pm on a Friday and they said it was about a 40 minute wait. I think we got there just in time because a line started to form behind us. We started with the Grabong, get it! So good. We ordered the chef nuit pad thai and Gaeng Masaman with braised beef, which were both amazing. Again the portions are huge so we took home leftovers. I also found the prices to be really reasonable. All that food plus 2 beers came to $66!Amazing food and service!  Truly authentic Japanese!  We lived in Japan and it brings us back by being there. The staff is so kind and the food is so delicious.  We look forward to going back soon and frequently.Went here just before a movie. The service was fast but that's it. I ordered the mango and shrimp quesadilla. My friend ordered nachos. The food was not good. I and my friend could not finish our food and we had stomach aches immediately after.Great food, drinks, and service. This is not a traditional Mexican restaurant, but the food is high quality and the presentation is impressive. I  can't wait to go back!Fantastic service and a wonderful pork banh mi sandwich!  In fact, this is my favorite banh mi in Montreal, and I've tried over a half-dozen places.  Better yet, it's the cheapest banh mi.This is my first Yelp review where I am confused. However I believe I must write something to understand my experience at PJ McIntyre. This may allow me to be a better person and appreciate more my fellow Irishmen.

I visited for lunch on the last day of February. The visit created a strange tedium with Saint Patrick Day next month. It was like I was groping myself under the bar and PJ McIntyre needed to berate my hapless visit . His effort may have been to negate the last day in the shortest month of the year. 

The waitresses were cheery with excitement sharing conversation with a local afternoon wine swiller about experiences that happen at the bar for the festive holiday. The large dwelling pub empty other than two younger ladies in college that were studying for an exam over a pint.

I ordered food. A reuben and buffalo chicken dip appetizer with tortilla chips. I can say the food was okay. I would not say it was good or bad. The menu is confusing. The options are good however there is not an identity to the pub. There are some items that are identified with a logo, celtic,  to indicate signature dishes. I don't like this practice at this restaurant or others. If location has an Irish theme people will understand details on their own I believe perhaps I am wrong. I will say that I have had a more creative Reuben sandwich. 

I imagine Rocky River suburbanites visiting this place for Ohio State football games, Guiness pours, and a dubious misappropriated nostalgia. I don't understand this place. If you have read Swift's Modest Proposal and understood his humor, this place may be difficult. You will have to pull the smiles inside. 

I may visit again and revisit my review to add another star. They advertise on their website as 'Cleveland Ohio's Most Authentic Irish Pub'. I favor the Old Angle or Harp for food, drink, and friends almost any day.The wife and I went to check out the brunch at The Asbury with another couple this past Sunday. It has replaced Harvest Moon Grill in the Dunhill Hotel, which I had only tried once and left very disappointed. I don't think both restaurants are affiliated in any way, and I can safely say that The Asbury hit the spot for brunch. It's in a relatively small space in the Dunhill with an entrance on Tryon. 

The menu itself is also not overly abundant but there is a good variety. The biscuits, deviled eggs, and southern French onion soup were enjoyed by all as the whole table split these snacks. I don't even like biscuits and these were very good in a bad for you kind of way. I ordered the "carrot" hummus which was different but definitely worth a try especially with the crispy crackers that accompanied it. 
For entrees, the dishes were cream cheese stuffed french toast, pork belly Benedict and the wife and I each took the smoked trout hash. We didn't really share these dishes, but we all wound up with empty plates so that means something. For dessert, the table split the chess pie, which is apparently a old school southern dessert that I had never had before. It came out with 3 pieces of pie stacked up on each other with the actual chess pie being in the middle surrounded by pieces of chocolate pie on either side. In a word, it was delicious! We will definitely be returning here soon and trying out the lunch and dinner menus.Pho Lan is good, although they charge for some of the "extras" that usually come included (such as a spring roll cut up on Bún).  Their Wor won ton soup is one of the better versions of the dish I've had, although the lack of a bigger size means I'm usually buying something else, too (i.e., spending more than $15 just on myself).

This is one of two or three vietnamese restaurants in Chestermere, and is certainly worth trying.  I've chatted with the owner a few times, and she's a very nice lady who really respects her customers.

It's easy to miss this place; it's attached to a gas station in a gravel parking lot.  The pin on the map is a bit misleading; access Pho Lan from Merganser Drive W (not from Hwy 1A \/ Chestermere Blvd).Just wonderful!  Brittany was our server and she was so nice, had great suggestions and was very attentive.  The food was fabulous!  Everything was home made, hummus, banaganoush, dolmas, tatziki and omg the borek!!!!  Please give them a try, you will NOT be disappointed!Mon night we walk in at 630 and asked if we had a reservation. Um....no. We peaked around the corner and saw the bar wide - we sat at a 2 seat high top (which was not offered to us at all). Went for the $6 sammy night. A burger, chix sandwich, 2 glasses of wine and 2 beers was $36. But THAT burger was one of the TOP 5 best burgers I have ever, ever had. We'll go back for the burgers some other stuff that came out that looked awesome but BOM....tone down the pretention...I've been to many pho restaurants and I'd have to say that this place was a huge disappointment. My first visit wasn't too bad and I found myself wanting to go back. The Banh Mi was only $2.95 and though it wasn't the best vietnamese sandwich I've had, it was decent for the price. The pho portions were smaller and more expensive compared to Superior Pho Restaurant across the street and the soup just wasn't as tasty. If you know pho, then you'd know how important the soup is. 

After going there for the second time, I've decided that I won't be making any more visits to this place. The service is lacking a bit, in that the waiters and waitresses don't even bother asking how the food is. Also, we were disappointed to find some unwanted things in the soup. Maybe it's because this is a new restaurant, but it's important for the owners to maintain some quality control. The inconsistencies in the flavor of the soup was more than enough for me to say bye bye to this place.I got a little too excited when I found the Groupon and bought way too many. Anyways, the procedure is you pick you seats when you buy your tickets. There are leather recliners type chairs which are super comfy, then there are counters with rolly chairs. 

We ordered the appetizer sampler. It was around $15, but it SOUNDED like you got a lot of food with it so we got it. This is what we got 2 chicken tenders, 2 quesadillas, a small handful of parmesan fries, and 2 coconut chicken tenders. Umm... in my world that small amount of food should not cost that much. Also, call me crazy but shouldn't parmesan fries come with parmesan on them?

Round 2 of Groupon-mania we ordered the quesadilla meal. Still a rip off :( I don't think those poor quesadillas had any flavor at all! The chips and salsa that came with it are good though. I would suggest just getting your free soda and not getting any overpriced, bland food.I think part of the reason this buffet has some decent reviews is because of the pricing. If you have a discount, like the 50% off coupon in the coupon book you receive when you check-in, then this might be more worth it. In fact, that is the only reason we ate here, and the only reason I wasn't angry about the food quality when I left. I guess this falls along the lines of, you get what you pay for. The food was bland and very under seasoned, no matter what themed section you went to. They didn't have a large variety like other Vegas buffets. Their dessert selection was lacking. I went on seafood night, and though they had crab legs, they were not kept very warm and so I ate cold crab legs. The fish I had was dry and needed seasoning. And the only vegetables in sight was a dish of unsalted green beans.Really incredible food!  Great atmosphere and view!  Service was fantastic as well!  You will not be disappointed!I drove by here so many times and always wondered what it was like.. Finally I decided to stop by for a quick dinner the other day.

I started my dinner with frozen Thai Mai.  When the server said something about pineapple, it sounded sweet and good.  It sure was yummy. I think I like drinks with pineapple.

For my dinner, I ordered honey walnut crispy shrimp with brown rice (dinner choice is jasmine or brown rice).  She mentioned with extra dollars, they can substitute to fried rice.  They put main dish over rice when they serve (it doesn't come separately), I thought fried rice will change the main dish taste.

Friendly service with nice smiles. I can't explain it but I just felt pleasantly comfortable dining there. 

When it came time to pay, the server swiped a card by my table. I just thought it was comforting (although I wasn't doubting anything) that she didn't have to walk away with customers' credit card.

It was weekday dinner but they were busy, so I sat at the outside patio (with heater of course...)  As I walked back inside to leave, I saw the sign Toledo 1,900 miles...(can't remember the exact numbers).  It just made me smile. I didn't know but Louie is from Toledo. I think I will be coming here more frequently.We enjoy the food here. The soups are very good and I really love the wild lamb dish. I enjoy the fresh rolls (meat and mint spring rolls) and the jade roll (add avocado) as an appetizer. The peanut sauce is decent after I add some ground red chile to it. The green tea noodles are very interesting as well. Their lunches are a really good deal and we usually get good service. I have trouble getting them to make my food spicy enough, but they see a Caucasian female and are afraid to put spice in the food. I hope that one day, they will start recognizing me and do the spice right the first time, or I won't have to make do with the little tray of add your own, which is not as tasty and I get really tired of having to do this. I love fresh Thai chiles and it is hard to get a restaurant to bring me any. We usually just drink iced tea when we come here, so I cannot speak to the bar selections.Kinda expensive at $40 per person, but a
Must do for your Vegas experience! The seafood was plentiful, service was excellent and food actually had flavor to it. This is definitely not your typical buffet. Enjoy!We had to go here because it's reminiscent of San Francisco. It's a darling little casino where you can empty your wallet and then stagger around with a cocktail in your hand and nothing but lint in your pocket.We went to House of Tricks on Saturday night.  It was our first visit.  We had a reservation and arrived on time.  Our table was ready within 5 minutes.  We asked for a table outside; the dining area (both indoors and out) is lovely.  Very comfortable.  Very romantic.  We were quite impressed.

Our waitress was friendly and kind but the service was incredibly slow, whether or not this was her fault was hard to tell.  We got seated at our table around 7:50 PM and our salads were not delivered to the table until 9 PM.  They did bring us extra bread at our request.  But waiting an hour for salads is pretty ridiculous.  They were fresh, beautiful and delicious.  We also ordered the soup of the day as well... potato soup which can be pretty ordinary.  It was amazing!!  Our entrees were served about 15 minutes later and we weren't disappointed.  The plates were lovely and every element on the plate was wonderful.  

The food was fantastic.  Regardless of the slow service we will go back.  In particular the lunch menu looks really great.Mehhhh. I came here a few years ago so maybe it's changed but I came with a big party and none of us particularly liked our dishes. I expected a lot from Bobby Flay and his southwestern spicy palate, but everything was kind of bland and lackluster.I had high hopes for this place, I really did. The atmosphere is very authentic, the drinks were good, and the staff is friendly. However, I was very disappointed with my meal. I had the orange ruffy, shrimp and octopus deep fried ball. It was okay but definitely not worth the steep price. It was on the bland side. The person I was with wasn't too thrilled about their beef tacos, either. Disappointing.My husband and I loved this place. We went on a Wednesday for the oyster special. They were fabulous. We both had prime rib--also very good. Just loved the decor and atmosphere. Our server was spot on as well.  Will return when we come back to Vegas.Almost fantastic.

Nice looking place, for sure. Tons of light wood throughout the entire restaurant, good soft lighting, some pretty interesting touches here and there.

Some other reviews mention reservation difficulty: I had no problem getting a reservation through OpenTable for the next day, and they called to confirm it about 4 hours ahead of time. The service from everyone except for our actual server was really solid; she was a bit on the confused & distracted side.

Food: pulled pork croquette, venison ragout, lamb shoulder confit with wild leek tortelloni, and the warm apple pudding.

The pulled pork was very good, not overdone in any way, just a great appetizer with top notch quality ingredients. The ragout was really disappointing and pretty much tasted like Hamburger Helper, and totally not what I expected.

The lamb shoulder confit & leek tortelloni was out of this world. Seared with some sort of cinnamon, clove, cardamom ish spices and with some fantastic tzatziki-like greek yogourt on the top, every bite was amazing. The tortelloni with it was filled with perfectly done leek. Everything about that dish was good.

For dessert, the apple pudding was incredible. Light and almost creamy, not too sweet, with caramel and sea salt on top and then dolce di mascarpone - dolce de leche folded into mascarpone cheese (!) - on top of that. 

Excellent wine selection, too, a pretty wide variety of reds perfect for most of the dishes at Marben, including the Niagara red we had.

It was really a 5-star experience, other than the ragout and the server, and they could fix those things and I'd give it five stars in a second.

$150 for two, with a really good bottle of wine and moderate tip.Got on yelp to find a brunch spot that I had never been before and found this place. When you first walk in the ambience is so quaint. Feels like grandmas kitchen. Had a hard time deciding what I wanted from there menu but ended up deciding to go with the breakfast burrito (even though it's 2 in the afternoon!). Got my favorite apple juice and husband got a bottled old sprite from the coke machine which is pretty cool! Food came fairly quickly and they had cut it for us to spilt. It was a green chili pork breakfast burrito which was so different than one I had ever had before! Had black beans, queso, green chili pork... Mm delicious. I liked the plate clean. They have homemade granola and bread you can buy. I'm all about this place. Eat local as often as you can it always pays off!I came here to update my review, and am in disbelief that I never wrote one.  We've been eating at Tottie's for over a decade, and have many wonderful memories of dining with friends, and are still making more.

All the food here is good.  But whereas I ordered the Tangerine Beef, and similar items when we first started coming here, I've moved on to much more interesting dishes (and ones that you can't get some version of at Panda Express).

A friend shared her Tom Ka Gai (soup) with us about eight years ago.  It's incredible- so delicious.  It's sort of like hearing beautiful music; you can't help but smile and appreciate it.  I've tried making it at home, but it's not as good (and a little complicated to make).  We have it with shrimp and\/or chicken.  Up until a few months ago we ordered it at every visit because it's just unlike anything else anywhere.  It's odd, because I have never liked coconut, and coconut milk is the base of this wonderful concoction.

Another one I love is the Red Curry (I can't remember what it's called on the menu).  I just order "Red Curry".  It has a depth of flavors I can't match at home.  I keep trying though.  It's just amazing.  Steven, the manager, suggested that I order it at spice level one and ask for the heat on the side.  Good suggestion!  You can really taste the toasted spices and other wonderful flavors, and make it as hot as you like.  It's a little frustrating though- I make really good curry (red or yellow), but I can't figure out how to make it just like this.

If I had time, I'd write more.  There's much more to be said.  But we recommend this restaurant to everyone who visits and has just moved here.  Everyone else already knows about it.Lasagna is amazing as well as the sandwiches.  A bit pricey but worth the authenticity!  Try the cannolis!  A must!  Expect line ups.We enjoyed our Valentine dinner on the patio with great service along with the Sea Bass and Salmon entrees while listening to Jazz music.I just stumbled on this place while getting gas next door and it was amazing..i ordered Nachos Locos and a Big Burrito and you know I thought it was going to be small like Taco Bell or something. I saw the guy making an order and I thought wow he is putting alot in the take out box so I asked the nice lady at the register what was he making and she said he was making my order, I tell you my mouth dropped wide open when she said that. The Nachos Locks has both beef and chicken and it was so fresh and when I saw him make the Big Burrito it filled the whole take out box from corner to corner and it was huge. The place is clean and nothing but smiling faces and you can see in the back while they are cooking too. Food is fresh all day and you get a bag of chips and salsa with your order. I am definitely coming back.Went to dinner with my husband after purchasing their Groupon deal. I ended up only drinking 1 mimosa and hubby no alcohol so we didn't take advantage of the free alcohol drinks included in the deal. But anyway the food was really good. A lot of protein choices like carving table, sausages, and chicken cooked different ways. Great salad bar you can make your own or they had some made like Greek salad and spinach bacon salad which I tried both And were really good. Other food options were pastas and breads To be completely honest not a lot of options but everything I tried was really good!! I would definitely go back.Excellent repas.  Bonne ambiance.  Bonne musique.  Excellent service.  On aime le concept.  Filtrer l'eau municipale au Brita serait un atout.We had the pepperoni\/mushroom and the Bianca with sliced tomatoes.  Everything was very good. My wife and I each ordered 10" pizzas and had enough to take home. Nice restaurant, friendly staff and fun holiday decorations up for Halloween.Merita runs a great restaurant.  The wait staff she has established are all personable and good at their jobs.  The menu is quite varied and enjoyed for breakfast, happy hour or whatever!  Have never had a bad dish!  Even the customers I have communicated seem to be pleasant, probably because they are enjoying the service and food!  My kinda place!!!Rude. I love this place they are so nice. Too bad theres one punk chef that wanted to scowl at me while he walks out the dining room wipes his sweaty forehead and goes to smoke a cigarette on the patio where clearly the business owner has placed a no smoking sign all the while messing up my order. Great cold and rushed food. And when my order is ready i asked if he owned the place. They said they are a family owned restaraunt. And i said well that guy sure acts like he owns it. Low class ill spend money elsewhere.The majority of my visits here have been mediocre at best.  Sometimes the rolls aren't great, more than once they have been completely out of premium sake, other times the wait staff is slow, and once we waited 60 minutes for 2 rolls with zero apologies (and they were far from busy).

I suppose they are the best in a 4 mile radius - but if I'm in the mood for quality, I'll choose some place else.  On the plus side, they do have happy hour specials and if the weather is nice, they have a great patio area for drinking and dining.Service was fabulous, professional, courteous w a smile, and beyond expectation for a casual chain restaurant.  I was impressed w my server, Stephanie, and especially w another one I observed (Chanel).  Chanel was extremely patient w a special needs gentleman.  She brought each of the dressings to taste.  She pointed to each one describing and writing what they were. She was consistently taking her time with him with his many questions and listening intently to his speech impediment to understand his needs.  She even kept him updated on his spending to keep within his spending budget and; yet, she still was able to take care of her other tables at the same time without slacking. Wow!

I ordered the unlimited soups & salads between 11-3 for $6.99 & my mom ordered the baby back ribs (nice smoky flavor she commented).  The grilled shrimp & spinach salad was very tasty served w hot (actually served nice & perfectly warm) bacon vinaigrette and Steph made sure I  was perfectly satisfied and full w refills of the great salad & soup of the day (broccoli & cheese). 

Once again, pleasantly surprised with the quality & price for a casual dining experience. Thank you Steph, Chanel, and the hostess Yvonne.Ordered delivery at 515 on Monday during Monday Night Football so I figured it would be a while. They said it would be 1 hr, 615 delivery. That's fair- MNF and all. I called at 640 and they said it would be delivered in 5 minutes. At 700 they finally show. 45 minutes late. Not even a call from management to apologize. Really? Next time I'll order from Pizza Hut.Employees are nice & attentive! Waffles are perfect for my friend & I who don't eat too much but fills us up just rightI loved the atmosphere and the comfortable lounge chairs. We came for Happy Hour. The food was delicious. Definitely try the calamari! For only $6 you get a huge portion. Great deal on drinks as well. We loved it so much we're going back tomorrow night. Our waitress, Skylar, was super sweet and attentive. I've see  other reviews about a tall blonde providing poor service, but Skylar (who is tall and blonde) was fantastic. Definitely come here for happy hour from 4-6. The dress code is slightly above casual FYI.I went here yesterday with a group of work friends based on a recommendation from some fellow foodie friends. 

First off, let me start of saying I've never had Venezuela food before so I really had no idea what to expect. I looked to fellow Yelp members for their reviews and they had rated it pretty good (avg. 4 star) so I was excited to try it out. 

The restaurant is clean, modern and "fresh" when you walk in. The exposed bricks and party pictures around Arepa give it a cool and young atmosphere. We had 9 people in our party and were easily accommodated (we did call ahead though to make sure). The waiter was polite and our water glasses were always being topped up. 

For drinks I decided to try the sugar cane lemonade it was AMAZING! Soo good. It wasn't your typical lemonade as it tasted more like half and half (that being half lemonade half iced tea). Will go back even for the drink ! lol

As for lunch I ordered la llanera-beef tenderloin, avocado, fresco cheese, tomato. It was good but the cheese really threw me off. I was not a huge fan. However that being said, the arepera was actually pretty good, much better then I was expecting. The small side of coleslaw that came with the meal was very good and light, and I never really like or eat coleslaw.

I gave it a 3 star because while it was good and I really enjoyed my lemonade, the cheese in the la llanera made my stomach feel off for a while and I felt super full (not in a good way) all day. While the rest of my table said their meals were good, I would not order the la llanera again.

P.S. I posted a pic of the la llaneraThere's a lot of dessert places in the area, but their aesthetic presentation really blew me away! Everything they bring out is instagram worthy. Also, the pricing is competitive (in the field)
I got the perfect parcel crepe, which was a brownie, vanilla gelato wrapped in a crepe with walnuts, strawberries and lots of chocolate drizzle. My only complaint is the crepe was kind of tough. 
My friend got the C'wow (the coveted melting chocolate dome!) so props to them for offering it first. Lots of footage to share.If you like Thai cuisine, you must check this place out. 
The location is a short walk from the financial district. A group of colleagues and I went during the lunch rush. We were promptly seated. A gentleman stopped by to give us a few minutes to place our orders. 
The menu is small but it is filled with items that are traditionally Thai - Guay Tiaw, Nua Gra Teaum. 
I went with a delicious red curry (Gaeng Phed) with shrimp. Extra spicy, of course. 
The dish was flavourful with the right amount of coconut milk, bay leaves, squash and plump shrimp. It comes with a side of white rice. 
All tastefully presented and displayed. 
The ambiance is quite nice and cozy. 
Definitely a great spot for lunch. I hear the pad thai is awesome. I will be sure to check it out during my next visit.Monday morning breakfast of steak and eggs.
Options included egg preparation, toast type, meat temperature, and potatoes.
I ordered over easy, sourdough, medium rare and potatoes diablo.  Of course I had to have coffee as well.
Coffee and water arrived first.  The coffee was in a hot pot with at least a quart of delicious coffee.  Water was reverse osmosis and highly drinkable.
My steak was cooked to order, but cold.  The waitress rescued me and soon a nice hot steak and eggs order was in front of me.
I enjoyed it for the duration of everything on the plate except I could not finish the potatoes!
Assorted jellies included a rarity: mixed fruit.  Nice!
Good Breakfast stop!I love Sushi Ken! The staff are all so friendly and welcoming, and the food is delicious. It's always bustling at dinner time, but that's just proof of how good it is. I'd recommend the chicken curry (my favorite) and the rice bowls!Would have been fine if I didn't have to yell to get a bartenders attention. There were 3 girls behind the bar and all of them were too busy taking selfies to notice me. This was Saturday 7\/8 between mid night and 2am.  working at a bar myself i was not impressed at allWas walking around this area and came across this place. Caught me eye because you can see the people make these pastries behind a glass pane. They are known for their walnut cakes although they do have a few other pastries you can try. They have 3 different flavours so we just got an assortment to try all three flavours. The price for these is also really cheap. It was my first time trying the walnut cake and it wasn't anything too special. Its good for a small and cheap snack. They have a little sitting area at the back of the restaurant.We expected too much from this place. We have been trying to come here for so long and when we finally did, it was not as great as I hoped it would be. 

That being said, their service was excellent. I loved their pork bun. The umami ramen had good ingredients but the broth could be richer. It lacked something distinct and I can't say what. Its just that we had just visited Sujeo and tasted their Sujeo Ramen and we couldn't help but compare flavors. Sujeo had a much richer broth. 

One thing I would recommend staying far away from is their dumplings. It was straight out of a frozen packet. Our's has raw edges as well- it wasn't steamed through out. We also tried their burrito for brunch. The chips and salsa that came with was the best. The burrito itself was nothing out of the ordinary. 

I would hope to get back here again to try their dinner menu. They have much more variety of Ramen for dinner. I won't come back for brunch again.You don't expect to have the best burrito of your life in a strip mall on the border between Mississauga and Oakville.  

But you will.

Chorizo is not a fine dining establishment.  You can take a seat at the tables (if one's available) or order to go.  When you order, your burrito's meat is put onto the grill,and when it's ready to go, you get a rundown of the ingredients available, and the server puts it together in front of you. 

The ingredients are fresh and flavourful, and the burrito will be a filling meal. 

They sell more than just burritos, of course.   They sell fajitas, which differ in some ingredients, taco salads, tacos, and quesadillas. 

Chorizo is a great place to get food, even if it's a little out of the way.  Make the trip.  It's worth it.I recently got an anniversary cake made here based on their Samoa Girl Scout Cookie cupcake and it was fantastic!  Everything I have ever had here is either really good or great.  When are tasty cupcakes not a good time?  Always fresh and moist and delicious.  I have had cupcakes from other bakeries in this area and there is a major difference.  In fact writing this review makes me want to head over there today!Went on a Saturday afternoon, ate off the buffet and boy was everything fresh and hot. The salad bar was clean and constantly attended, and the veggies were crisp and fresh. The pizza was to die for, have not had pizza like this since living back home in Florida. The wait staff was also excellent and attentive.  Would give 10 stars if able.Came here for the first time with coworkers because they kept talking about how good the food is. So I had to try it and I was very happy with what I received.

I ordered the small chicken souvlaki. It was a good size for a small, but a little pricey. The total with a can of pop with 18.70. Usually when I go to a Greek place I'm use to paying $12-13. 

The chicken was cooked perfectly and so was the rice.

Overall I would go back, it was great for lunch. Call ahead though because it can get really busy. 

Only downside other than it's a little pricey is that that don't have their menu post online anywhere. No website. Nothing. So you literally have to go there unless you memorized the menu to know what's on special that day or even on the menu.

Will update when I try more food. Until than happy eats.Mother India is the sister restaurant of Gandhi's but to attract more attention it should be really be known as Gandhi Plus because a) it's menu is the same as Gandhi's with a few extra's thrown in and b) it's more of a sitdown establishment with the bigger seating area and a less rushed vibe. You can also enjoy your rotis and other indian cuisine favourites served on plates and tableware. All of Gandhi's rotis are featured on the menu here, I tried the butter chicken for comparison and was impressed. It came in the same soft, warm shell as it's sister resto and the filling inside was less salty and more complex in terms of spicing. It's still a huge package, plenty of tender chicken morsels tucked into the rich curry. Mmmmm. The menu also featured some south indian dishes such idli (rice cakes to be savoured with chutneys) and a variety of dosas-a return visit is in order to try them out. Even though it was virtually empty when I went, my order still took 20 minutes-seems like they're not used to the hustle and bustle present at their twin restaurant. So if you're in the west, west end and are craving indian, give Mother India a try. It's also open on weekends which is a another advantage it carries over Gandhi!My boyfriend and I went to dive for our weekly date night. We like to try new restaurants and to our delight, we chose Dive this week! The menu looked delicious and was pretty reasonably priced. The drinks were a bit on the strong side, so if you like that, this is your place. The food was absolutely delicious (I got the pulled pool sandwich, yum!) and the staff was very sweet. I recommend going for sure!I came here on a busy Saturday or a nice quick breakfast. The line was long but it goes fast and I decided to order a Parmesan Asiago Bagel
With bacon scallion cream cheese. The bagel was chewy warm and delicious with a nice savory coating of cheese. The bacon scallion cream cheese was savory and dense and just the perfect amount. I also like the large window looking into the kitchen as the bagels are being steamed and baked. Overall I enjoyed my bagel and I will be back, it is definitely a great breakfast place for a nice fresh bagel.Good place if you're looking for a well-balanced "bun bo hue"! However, this is one of the most unattractive places in town! Read more on http:\/\/theforbiddenmeal.com\/2014\/11\/16\/a-hidden-vietnamese-restaurant-in-ville-st-laurent\/I am giving this four stars for the service. The food is not up to standard of the other Ramsey Gordon locations in our opinions.  It is good, but the sliders that we had were on the salty side, and the burgers that we had were not the best that we've ever had. I like the Gordon Ramsay pub burgers better.  The service however was first class, and everyone was more than welcoming.The first few times I went here, I wasn't very impressed by the flavors. However, it turns out that with curry, you really just need to find the type best suited for your taste! I've since discovered their Yummy Green Bean dish with red curry, and it is AMAZING. Not only that, but the fresh steamed pork buns they serve are out of this world. Only downside is that sometimes by dinner they are sold out of them, but I guess that's a good thing, since they're so delicious and everyone loves them!

We've also started trying out their Aladdin's Noodle menu in the evenings, and it's just as delicious. They house soy sauce noodles with chicken was amazing. If you haven't tried this place out, you really need to do so! I've branched out on many of their many other menu offerings (their robust wonton soup is PERFECT on a cold day), and have found many other favorites.

Their new remodel of the restaurant really freshened things up! One of the area's best curry hot spots!09\/2018: 

I didn't go back by choice.  And man I have to stand up for myself....no more crap food & service!

What a mess.  Waiter was MIA most the night.  Manager and staff talking and laughing by cash register near kitchen.  Food sucked as usual!  Why bother you with details.  Just don't go!

Pictures posted!

06\/2018:

I don't know why I go back, I think it's the fries with their own salt because everything else is poorly done.

I had the French onion soup and I found a whole onion peel....gross (see pic).  And, there was dirt or kitchen burnt something on my plate.  The Manager offered to remake for me, nice but they have to go back and remake?  

Second one was better, but they forgot the garlic toast and when I asked for it they came back with one instead of two so I had to ask for the other one.

By this time 45 minutes had passed and my son was getting ancy.  So he played with he chalk board game-another not so bright idea, chalk was flying everywhere while I tried to enjoy my second meal!

So the no

Overall the kids meal had three small chicken strips and about 2 ounces or broccoli served in their sauce side cup if that tells you just how small it was.

Disappointed with the fries this round, like warm and mushy (the big ones).

If it wasn't for the pleasant server I would have given it ONE star.My husband and I ahd not been to Simons in along time. I remember it as an expanded deli..with booths and tables in a quaint atmosphere. TOO BAD what we found was a DARK DINGY restaurant, with wires hanging down from the ceiling, with miss matched chairs..with our table being stablized by a folded piece of cardboard...eating utensils on the floor under tables..and I would have overlooked that if the food had been the same...SADLY it was not! I was poorly presented..my husband had finished his sandwich and mine had yet to arrive at our wobbly table.I was sooo disappointed in what it had become because I remember what it had been. Sorry but I will not be returning nor recommending Simons to anyone.Could have been amazing - fresh, tasty ingredients of high quality are used -- but there was something really off about the pizza we ordered. I got the margherita pizza, which came swimming in a pool of liquid. The crust that wasn't touching liquid was really good but most of the pizza became super soggy. Also, part of the crust underneath had been burnt. I don't mean browned or a little bit of charring, I mean blackened and burnt to the point where that portion was not edible. The mozzarella on top was overcooked and rubbery. What a shame because with better preparation this could have been really good. Service and ambience we're good, just the skill level of the person making the pizza was questionable. We went during lunch time on a Saturday.3 words: SO MUCH FUN!! 

This place brings me back to my childhood. There are rows and rows of pinball machines, some old and some new. The older pinball machines are cheaper and more nostalgic. There are also old school video games like Pacman, Tetris, Galaxia and my favorite Duck Hunt. It definitely brought out the competitive side in me. If you forgot to bring quarters, don't fret! There are change machines everywhere. The cool thing about the change machine is that if you only have a $20 bill, it'll change $5 worth of quarters and give you back three $5 bills. One star docked because a lot of the games were broken and the bathroom was a little gross. 

It's sad that kids these days won't know the joy that these games used to bring. If you are looking for a few hours of fun for cheap, this is definitely your place.It's so sad; this place had such promise.  I used to come here once a week for their specials.  They were always imaginative and never failed to make me feel like I was eating at a five-star restaurant.   Unfortunately,  this seems to have gone the way of the dire wolf, as the last few times I have been here, they seem to have reverted to an average restaurant in the middle of nowhere.  Hope they figure things out soon... businesses do not usually last in this location.My first time here and I got an Asiago bagel toasted with cream cheese. I can actually taste the Asiago cheese with every bite. The bagel is very fresh and soft. I definitely recommend this place.  I will be a regular here.Excellent food. Good service. Only problem: the quantity of food doesn't match the price. You'll get out of this restaurant hungry!! 5 raviolis is definitely not enough in a main dish.Excellent beer selection, quality food and attentive service. BBQ ribs outstanding. Sammie a wonderful server.Melt is a cool place to stop in CLE. They have all types of interesting grilled cheese sandwiches. You can't fail with any of their combinations. 

I stooped in had a grilled cheese and a few beers while watching a Cleveland Cavaliers basketball game at the bar. I'll be back. 

4 stars- love cheese- not healthyReally wonderful flavour creations and options here, love the tomatoes!!, and the ambiance feels fresh, lively and set perfectly for no fuss dining! 
Been meaning to write a review for some time on the food, but I think what makes this place exceptional is the outstanding service we had. One night we had a reso for 5, including two vegan friends, which can be tricky for tapas\/shared dining but our server really knew what he was doing, had plenty of recommendations, paced out our orders so everyone could have a bite with each round, just above and beyond service! 
During my last visit the owner was around and she noticed I shared a unique name with her, so she came by to our table to say hi and introduce herself and we chatted a bit. Later when our bill came we were surprised to see she had comp'ed our desserts. It was just a cherry on top of our already amazing meal experience. I'll definitely be coming back around for another visit to try out the new seasonal changes in the menu!Seriously, where did they go? I used to get the kimchi ramen here all the time. Now there's so many ramen shops everywhere but I always think about this place. If only they stayed open a few more years then there would be no competition.  R.I.P.Great service and the manager actually stopped by
Get the steaks and ribs 
I haven't had betterIt is with great sadness that I have to update my review, and not for the better, but what happened Las Margaritas???

Over the last year I have visited several times and the food and service has changed. After loving this place and having faith they just had some off nights, I decided to give them one last shot last night. And, unfortunately everything is still lacking.
Tables were dirty, food was bland, missing any flavor and service was non existent.
Unlike many Saturday nights the crowd was sparse too, maybe a sign the food has changed.My boyfriend INSISTED that we went to Mitchell's for our anniversary dinner and I couldn't argue it. I'm so glad we did.

We ordered SO much food. We started with some salads, he got the house salad, but he wasn't real fond of the dressing - it was like a ginger-y vinaigrette. Honestly I couldn't eat too much of it. I got the Ceasar salad which was delicious! Then we moved to an appetizer - mussels! First off, the size of this app is huge! Not too big that you can't eat afterwards, but definitely share with 1 or two people! The mussels were incredible and tasted so fresh! I also sipped from a strawberry mule, which had fresh strawberries in it - YUM!

Now, the entrees - I got the Shanghai Shrimp + Salmon + Sea Scallops and wow, I cannot emphasize enough how fresh the seafood tastes. It's such a difference! This dish was amazing! Has a little spice to it, but it's a large portion and you get the fantastic trio! I probably could've done without so much spinach piled under the salmon, but definitely not a deal breaker (eat your spinach kids!). My boyfriend got the swordfish of course! He finished his whole dish so that's all I have to say about that.

Previous to coming to Mitchell's, I was told to save room for dessert, or at least order it. GUYS, the sizes of these desserts! Dining in, we split a mini shark fin pie because we previously saw one go by which was full sized and I'm pretty sure it could feed a civilization! I had to take a piece of carrot cake home, which weighed about 50lbs! (Not really but it's the size of a mini cake!) Although these desserts sound terrifying, I highly recommend getting something to take!

I cannot wait for another excuse to go to Mitchell's. I do recommend reserving a table online or call ahead of time because it does get crowded. We reserved ahead of time, arrived, and were seating instantly. The service was great and it was just a really nice dinner.I love this place! The food is always great and it comes out fast. The service is excellent and extremely attentive. I usually get the Pud Asparagus or the Kow Pud Sub Pra Ros (like a Thai fried rice). They are both really great! You get so much food for the price too. The soup is great and so are the spring rolls. They ask how spicy you want it and always make it exactly how I ask. They also have hot sauces you can add yourself to give it a little kick. Stop by this location or one of the other Charlotte area spots. You won't be disappointed!My wife had another business symposium she was attending at her school (WP Carey).

As is our normal routine, when I am not invited; I act as the chauffeur service and drop her off  on campus, and make myself scarce.

Since I already know how long these symposiums go, and she would be famished by the time it was done, I figured I would stop by one of my favorite Chinese restaurants in the area and order enough food for the both of us for the next two days.

Hence, I stopped by my friends at ACE. Li stopped to say hi, and asked where my wife was. I told her that she was at school, and I am ordering for the both of us. Some for me to consume here, and the rest would be for takeout.

I ordered the Salted Pork Chop, House Fried Rice, Minced Garlic Choi Sum, Chicken Curry, and House Special Pan Friend Chicken Lo Mein. I sampled a few of them, and had them pack up the rest.

As always, this place is authentic, unassuming, and simply delicious. They never fail to impress me. And the service? Well, I come to this place because they know me by name, and they are always glad that I came! (cue Cheers theme song)My fiancé and I visited Pampas two days in a row. Pri was all around awesome both days, hands down. We sat in her section the first day with a few others and she went out of her way to make sure we were enjoying our experience. The second day we sat with Larry and he made sure the experience was awesome, as well. On this day we had a few hiccups, but Pri recognized us and did everything in her power to make us comfortable along with Larry. We really appreciate the hospitality from both servers and will visit the restaurant again on our next trip to Vegas. Thank you guys for everything!Absolutely amazing food. And the food came super fast. Had the falafel tacos and the dragon fries. No regrets.What a disappointment.
When this restaurant was the Green Chili, it was fantastic. Under new ownership and the new name, they obviously didn't keep the recipes or the cook! Too bad.
Bland bland bland. No flavour to anything and the food wasn't even properly cooked.
After I told the waiter that I was very disappointed, the owner came by to apologize, and even after telling him again what was wrong with the meal (we only ate about half of it) he still charged us full price. He gave me a $25 discount certificate for "next time". Why would there ever be a next time?
Terrible food and terrible customer service.I really wanted to like this place because the owner was very nice and has done a lot to turn the place around. It is clean and has nice atmosphere. 

The food was just not very good. It may just come down to personal preference but I did not care for the flavor at all.

I hope enough others enjoy the flavor and this place can stay in businessSuper great food especially the rice and grilled chicken. So much flavor and tastes very authentic. I love this place and highly recommend if you are in the area. The place is small and tucked in a strip mall but don't let that detour you it is worth trying and enjoying some great eats. Staff is friendly and remembers me everything I go there.I came here since it opened 7yrs. Ago It was good then the food quality went south the price went up too bad I just live 2min. From this placeLong ago, I sold my soul to Vientiane Palace.  I flipping LOVE IT.

You get a ton of food for meager prices.  I've always gotten what I've asked for in terms of spiciness (2 stars is adequate to get my nose running), and I've never had anything that was less than stellar in terms of taste.  They have an incredible selection of beers, too.  Try the Lao beer--it's perfect for quenching the spicy food.

The service is hilariously awful most of the time.  Have you ever seen the "Abe Vigoda's Restaurant" sketch on Conan?  One of the owners acts like that--stone faced, speechless and she all but dumps the food on the table.  You shouldn't take it personally; just shrug it off.  The food is too good to get all pissy about the service.I'm a fan of Desert Swirl. The prices are a little high but you get what you pay for. HUGE waffle cones of frozen yogurt that actually tastes GOOD. I tried their marshmallow flavor and it was unbelievable.

It's a good summertime treat, try taking the kids here once instead of the regular DQ for a switch and see how you like it. It's worth a try.I tried the Italian wedding soup today and it was delicious!!!  Looking forward to trying other dishes.  Super curious about the wine on tap!!Like many hotel eateries, if you dont lose your cash in the casino, you will surely pay premium for your eats.  Burger Bar is a great lunch or snack meal when you need that Beef Fix.  Hidden around the corner from the Mandalay Bay, this place is packed.  We waited about 20 minutes just to sit at the bar.  

Is it the perfect burger? No.  Not even close.  Does it taste like a premium gourmet burger?  Yes.  But the problem likes with the fixins.  Everything is an extra charge.  Bacon, avocado, cheese, onions, grilled onions, and of course the fries.  I think i had the NY beef or the sirloin.....the kobe seemed too outrageous at the time, but i think now, i should ponied up and just threw down $$$ for tasty american wagyu.

I dont recall sliders, but i think that wouldve been a better way to go.  Unfortunately at the time, i was sporting a nice hang over from the night before at the casino bar with the boys.....10 too many kettle ones.  Anyhow, this is prob incomplete...I need to give it another go around for a better feel.Dirty location!!! I was in the front waiting for food delivery and was bit by something several times!!! Staff is rude and stated I must have had the bites before coming in! I refuse to eat at a place that doesn't keep a clean restaurant.Very pricey 25 dollars for a single patty burger and had to walk to the back and get the cashier to take my orderI have been going to this diner year after year for 10 years off and on. Either late night or for a quick poutine. It has changed and so has the food but the menu is still a tried and trusted menu. I have always had the cheeseburger and it has always been hot, tasty and fresh. The bun has changed and so has the meat but both were great diner style burgers, the last one had a Portuguese bun and seriously hit the spot. The service is top notch considering the busy location and on a cold day it's a warm friendly spot.Very tasty!  Kind of an 'early bird special' place but the food made up for it.  Schnitzel was very good!Was craving a sub and saw all the Sicilian sub pictures on here so I decided to give it a try. 

Siena's is a nice restaurant with a deli attached to the side. I was really surprised by the selection of food at the deli. There was also gelato and lots of cold foods but I played it safe and went with the Sicilian. Cashier was was very friendly and the service was fast. 

I would probably give this sub a 4\/5. It was a delicious sub but I've had better. The bread was really good and it wasn't messy like other subs that I've had that are just prone to falling apart. 

I just really love that there's a freaking deli attached to this restaurant! I was expecting the sandwich to be pricey but it wasn't bad ($7.50 including tax). This may be my new place to go when I get the munchies while studying at the Sahara library.I ordered pizza for pickup, once I arrived home I realized there was hair in my food. I simply called back to this location and asked for a remake and for them to deliver it to me. I didn't think this was to much to ask considering it wasn't my fault. I was told that's wasn't an option (all while being super rude) and when I asked to speak with the manager was told there wasn't one even tho when I picked up my pizza I clearly saw a man with a solid red polo shirt on which was different from the rest. They need to work on customer service.Really big sized portions. Prices are very reasonable.  Decor and inside layout is beautiful designed. Good for romantic night or family night.  spicy pasta was on point..  bruschetta was light and refreshingly tasty.  Spaghetti and meatballs were a huge portion but a little salty.  Service was ok.  4 stars.Get the tables close to the fireplace on cold winter nights. Hot toddy and Bison burger to keep warm.  Great sliders plain and fancy.   Madison lager house draft made by big rock brewery. 

Great brunch on weekends as well. I used to get a huge Shepard's pie but the bison burger is huge and filling.We've been ordering from here for at least five years. The most recent deliveries have taken an excessive amount of time. Tonight we placed the order at 10:25pm. The driver called us at 11:03 saying he was on the 62nd street bridge and asking where we lived in Shaler. The only problem is we live in Lawrenceville... Off of Stanton. It's now 11:37 and still no order. We should have picked it up, I'd be in bed by now. The pizza better be hot, but I have a feeling it won't be.Breakfast food is the best food. I order a tofu scramble burrito and my partner ordered the Ranchero skillet. I loved mine. I tried a few bites of the Ranchero skillet  and that was awesome, despite the super hard tortilla it came with. I enjoyed the earthy ambiance and love eating organic. I am curious to try this place out again. However, I am not sure how often I could realistically eat there based on the prices. Over $30 for 2 breakfast entrees, a lemonade, and an iced americano is a bit pricey.  Overall, my first time at Pomegranate Cafe was a delicious experience.The best service I have ever had, from the host to the server , to the manager , to the food. All around absolutely delicious. The short rib hash is the best I have ever had. Amazing amazing host.Donut Bar is a place you must experience. Not only are there numerous options of delicate, savory donuts-- but the staff and chef always make you feel special when you walk through the door. I would recommend the French toast donut. So soft, crunchy and delicious that it melts in your mouth. Served warm directly to you with syrup and butter. I call it the triple B: buttery, beautiful and breakfast donut! The times I've visited Chef Jeff welcomes me and recommends options-- he treats everyone the same and makes your visit special. Great place for healthy gains  and not so healthy gains -- but let's face it? Donut calories do not count because they are at Donut Bar. Great place for indulging and calming your sweet tooth.Best gyro's in town! That's all I ever get so that's all I can speak for. Well I did have a corned beef sandwich once and it was pretty good. I've been carrying out here for years and have never had a bad experience. Great for lunch or a grabbing a quick dinner on the go.Solid place near College\/Yonge. The interior has a retro thing going on - at least they're trying! 
Sandwiches were HUGE and good. Make sure to get it with the onions and peppers. They overcooked the meat but it was still tasty. I think the sauce could've gone a little easier on the cheez wiz but that's just me. Gargantuan portion of fries, I would just get one to split between two. They also have Cotts Cherry Cola which made the meal even better.

All in all - a reasonably priced place near College and Yonge with HUGE portions. I can't speak to the quality of the cheesesteak since I'm not a connoisseur, but it was good enough. Also - CASH ONLY!

Would I return? Yea, if ever I am in the mood to eat an obscene amt of food.Nice and cozy place to study! Lots of table, big windows and the drinks are pretty good.Love the Aiello's concepts!   Went for dinner and had the traditional burger and it was awesome! The burger was cooked to perfection with a flavorful charr crust and placed on a homemade garlic knot bun.  The truffle fries were sensational!  My  sister had the grilled chicken sandwich with grilled vegetables which was also delicious.  The veggies were grilled perfectly and seasoned to perfection. The bread was warm and had a nice crunchy crust.   Love the open kitchen and the atmosphere in the restaurant; very warm and welcoming.   Service was excellent!   Will definitely return to try other entrees.Really disappointed in this place. Thought it was a cool local place with yummy burgers but really just a health scare with very poor service (unless you sit at the bar - the bartenders are always great service). The table servers we've had were slow, unapologetic and surly. And the food was just not worth it. I like a spot of grease when I'm craving it, but the food was overly greasy-fried, and the burger buns were dry. Not very tasty. If you want to have a junk food splurge, I can think of dozens of places where I'd line up first. Each time I've eaten there, I've left feeling nauseated. I've given Cold Beer & Cheeseburgers a 2nd and even 3rd chance because it's right near my house and my hubby seems to like it, but today broke me: they just posted something on Facebook that involved not only one of their greasy little burgers but topped with bacon and egg... with a side of doughnut. I kid you not! There's a photo!Breakfast is our thing, and it is apparent that it is Biscuits thing as well!  The food is great and so is the service.   We will eat here again!I wanted to give a higher rating. The food is certainly five stars. 

Chips and salsa arrive at the table soon after your seated. Both salsas are very good with the red being very mild and the green with a slight hint of heat. I would have liked a spicier, hot salsa with a bite and will ask if they have one on my next visit. The menu is large with a nice variety of enchiladas, tamales, burritos, fajitas and more. The portions are very generous. The enchiladas verde are excellent. The rice and bean sides were bland and average. The steak fajitas arrive sizzling hot with your choice of flour or corn tortillas, sour cream and guacamole. Large enough for sharing.

I cannot recommend the margaritas. They are week, pre-made, and flavorless. Save your money as they also add so much ice to the glass that there's really no room for any liquid.

Now, the service. Saturday afternoon @ 2pm. We were seated, served chips and given menus immediately upon arrival. After eating most of a basket of chips our server arrived for our drink order. We ordered margaritas and water. We got the margaritas and had to ask for water a second time. They did bring it, but only one glass. Food arrived very quickly after we ordered. It was a long wait between finishing lunch and receiving the check to final payment.

I hope they fix the staffing problem soon as I'd hate to write this one off my list.On a budget and want a romantic lunch date???  Go to Milos!!!

Window seating available - nice view of the strip
Décor and atmosphere was upscale
Prix-fixe menu for lunch is only $22.13!!! Includes appetizer, entrée and dessert!  
There's an extra $10 charge for certain items.

Everything tasted amazing!!! Perfect amount of food!! Great presentation!
I tried the
Grilled Octopus - extra $10 charge but totally worth it. Sashimi Quality and charcoal broiled.  Highly recommend this
Fresh Diver Scallop Skewer - fresh indeed
Lavraki (grilled Mediterranean Bass) - a guy at the table next to us liked it so much that he was sucking the head of the fish with his hands
Lamb Chops - I ordered rare and it came out just the way I liked it
Walnut Cake with Kaimaki Ice Cream - it was good but has a unique flavor, the ice cream complemented the cake very well
The "Real" Greek Yogurt - expect the tart taste of greek yogurt, and thick smooth texturePlay with menu. I got a royale with jerk sauce. Seasoned Cajun fries. No disappointment here. Black raspberry shake was intense. I was in a hurry. Food came quickly. Check not so much. Not a long wait tho.This place was so much fun! The mega bonus is that they have an incredible pool with cabanas and floaties, so yes, bring your bathing suit! They have lockers and towels for you. You can do so much at Top Golf, obviously you can come play golf, drink, watch a game, and then hit the pool. I also really liked their pro shop.

The only cons were the service and food, we waited about 10 minutes at a table and no one came up to us to ask us for our order or give us water. I had to go hail someone for this. Secondly, I ordered the chilaquiles and they were awful. Chilaquiles are supposed to be a warm breakfast option but here they were basically cold nachos. I honestly wanted to send them back but just settled on eating a few bites and letting them be.

I'll definitely be back for the entertainment but will probably choose to eat beforehand.The food here is probably one of the best in downtown summerlin. I have come here for date nate with my girlfriend multiple times and I have always been impressed.This is part of a chain of vegetarian food from the South of India. The food is spicy. 

The location is a retail mall so lots of parking available, except on weekends because of a movie theatre in the Mall. 

We usually try the Special Meal, which has an assortment of vegetables and bread options. 

During the weekend and on weekdays they also offer a buffet option. 

Service is efficient and the prices are reasonable.You can't go wrong with anything here: espresso, latte, cappuccino, they're all fabulous. I personally come here to listen to the banter, sit at the counter and take in the ambiance. The place has never changed and noe should it, it's a true gem on St. Laurent.I  just had an amazing Salmon steak lunch special. The ambience was great. Salmon cooked to perfection - crispy outside; melting and juicy inside. It came with Miso soup - it was a bit cold but was tasty.This place was pretty good. I ordered a Mocha with Almond milk.

The drive thru was a bit weird. But it is what it is. 
I was a bit shocked when they asked me what kind of milk I wanted. Lol.

The mocha was hot and delicious. 

I drive passed this place all of the time on my way to my aunts. It was definitely time to stop.

I will for sure be back.Several years ago I ate at Golden Phoenix.  They had the best garlic shrimp ever - a huge platter full of big, plump, juicy shrimp with a tasty brown sauce.  So I ordered some today along with some sizzling rice soup.  The rice didn't sizzle when I added it to the broth, and the broth was flavorless, save for a little hint of soy sauce.  The shrimp were small, dry, overcooked, and tasteless, and the container was half full of sauce!  The sauce wasn't bad, but I didn't pay $10+ for a container full of sauce.  I will never go back there again, and I am trying to spare others from this miserable take-out dining experience.From one downtowner to another, do not go here.  We were told that the wait was 1 hour but were never texted \/ called otherwise.  2 hours later...and nothing.  No updates, no table, nothing.  In the end, we were forced to call their corporate (Echo and Rig) phone number to see what was going on (because we were trying to be professional).   The people here apparently could not get ahold of their own people.  

When we came back to the restaurant to inquire about the status of our table, the manager was rude and said we would have to wait at least another hour.   I have never been treated in such a way in my life.  And especially from a place downtown.  

Good luck.I've had so many ups and downs from this pizza hut. Just like every other one, you pay for extra cheese and still get the same amount of cheese, less than any other company. It's damn near impossible to get a normal amount of cheese or more from this place. Secondly they almost ALWAYS forget the dips that I order and pay for. 

So I'd say 8\/10 times the pizza I get is dry, overcooked and cold, and the few other times it is decent but only slightly warm.

Last Friday I put an order through the Pizza Hut app for delivery like I normally do. I got a call from the store a few minutes later saying that my house is not in their delivery range.... Note that I have been ordering from this store since I moved in 3 years ago. My place is less than 10 minutes from the store, about 3.5 miles up Mt Royal Blvd. 

They eventually called back and said there was a driver coming up that way anyway and they delivered it. Mind you after this time it had been like 30 minutes out of the oven by the time it even left the shop. I told them I'd pick it up if they made a fresh one but refused. They made sure to mention any further orders through the app would not be delivered.! I went there because I like the tostada shell. I asked for all, except no chicken, nothing with animals on it. I told them I want more beans instead and never got it! The manager came to the window and says that they do not have animals there, they have chicken! I just smile back since stupidity is hard to cure! I also mention that I am VEGAN. She looks at like she never ever heard that world! How embarrassing!This place is a model of consistency!  We've been going to this restaurant for at least 10 years and it's always amazing.

The food is fresh, well seasoned, with a variety of flavors and textures.  Simply delicious and we can't wait to go back!My friends and I visited the Wrigley Mansion for Sunday brunch ($54 a person) in celebration of a birthday and we were extremely pleased! The view is absolutely phenomenal and the full glass windows let you soak it all in. The staff starts you off with mimosas, wine, or domestic beer and ensures you never have an empty glass. The buffet is literally anything you could want... and more! They have all the basic breakfast items, a pancake and omelet station, prime rib and lamb carving station, general lunch items, sampled meats and cheeses, and let's not forget about the dessert table. It started getting a little busy around 11am, so I'd recommend a 10am reservation. Keep in mind, someone at the table must be a member so come prepared to pay the annual $20 membership. Trust me, you'll be back!I went two more times after my first visit and the quality of food has deteriorated a bit, the pho now tastes ok and also other dishes are ok.

I probably will not be going there for Vietnamese any more, as there other great places for the same price.Is Very good and food very yummy waitress very fast and very polite and inside is very dark. Place Is very far from me but is worth it and very good price. They deserve the tips.Great food, great service! We went for my brother's birthday, and we will definitely go again for special occasions. Unlike other Brazilian steakhouses I've been to, they weren't stingy with the best kinds of meat, and they even took requests if we wanted something we hadn't tried yet. The best part was obviously the meat, but the salad and sides were delicious too. They even brought out a special birthday dessert for my brother on the house!I am not sure if this restaurant has new management but we have ordered take out weekly for a very long time and it was always delicious. Today our food was not good.  Burned egg roll and spring roll, chicken wings looked like little bitty baby chick wings...horrible, not worth $6 and the moo goo was tasteless.Hey, this is a cool cheap and affordable way to have Mediterranean food! Unbelievably I liked it better than some of the sit-down restaurants in the area! The veggie platter was amazing! We will be going againI'm a rocker by nature but have an affinity for country music and the honky tonk scene.  Checked this place out with a couple friends just out of curiosity.  The place is huge!  Interesting mix of people, not just country lovers which was cool.  They really pack in the people though which after getting bumped into several times can get annoying depending on who's doing the bumping if you know what i mean.  Next time I wouldn't mind renting a cabana just to have a little personal space to retreat to if needed.  I had a decent burger with fries.  Food was middle of the road.  Nothing special.  Had more fun people watching then anything.The food at IHOF is pretty standard. Good, but not necessarily worth coming for. However, the options and the combinations you can get make it all worth it. 

Last time I went, I was starving and feeling a lot of different cravings. I ended up getting a side of hashbrowns and the Hawaiian fire chicken. Not a combo you can get anywhere else that I'm aware of, and the waitress was kind enough not to give me a weird look. The hashbrowns weren't  crispy, but it hit the spot. The fire chicken had a nice flavor, but it was nothing special. My s\/o got something off the Mexican portion of the menu, which he really enjoyed. We also saw these ladies get salads that were HUGE and very intriguing. 

The place is large and clean, and tables are nicely spaced out. It seemed like quite a number of people were there with coworkers, some even seemed to be in a lunch meeting. The service was also pretty fast--i was able to get in and out in about 35 minutes. They also have a private parking lot with ample spaces.  

Definitely a good place to go if you're in a larger group and want everybody to be happy! Plus, breakfast is served all day :)I've only been here for lunch but both times were great! Jeremiah is awesome. Attentive, funny, patient and makes terrific recommendations! My first time I had the marguerite pizza and wedge salad. The salad was creative and fresh. Pizza was too thin and kind of soggy for my taste, but still tasted good, especially if you like thin pizza. The other day for lunch I tried the grilled chicken sandwich. . The menu is typical but there are a few creative things that stand out. I've never had to wait and the waiters are very attentive and friendly. The interior is surprisingly roomy, casual, comfortable, very clean. Good place for a business lunch or casual dinner. I plan to go back a few more times. They are now serving brunch too!The menu is basically limited to wontons and a side of veggies. If you're looking for a simple quick tasty meal this is the place to come.   The wontons here are huge and not full of fillers.  Mine had a ton of shrimp in it that you can actually see.  The broth was also nice and subtle.  The inside is a little dated but it was clean and the food was good.  Too bad they close so early (8pm)Nice decor. Comfy seating. This place is great if you like Northern Chinese style noodles and BBQ skewers or snacks while lounging to live background music in either English or Mandarin between 8-10 p.m. everyday. Otherwise, the food is just average. There is a lot of staff there and they have plenty of private rooms for parties, but the selection is not diverse enough for me to want to do one here. 

Location: 5\/5

Ample amount of parking. Conveniently located at Bridlewood Mall on two relatively major roads, Finch and Warden.

Decor: 4.5\/5

I probably like their decor second to their location. I love the hanging greens, the private rooms, the music lounge, the dining areas! The space is very well designed and beautiful.

When I was there on both weeknights, they were only a third full but yet they still ran out of the snacks that I wanted to eat twice and it was only 8:30 p.m., apparently, their main chef left hence why they only have such a limited selection now.

It is disappointing if I wanted to try half a dozen of the items on their menus but they only have noodles, skewers or dumplings to choose from...

Food quality: 3\/5

Food is very experimental. Only their noodles and BBQ are above average.

Still, I have a friend who was so into the place when it first opened that she once went there 4 times in one week, since it is conveniently located in Bridlewood Mall. I guess the ceiling and live music do have their cute charms, but the spinach with garlic and peanuts that I ordered there had so much garlic that I swear my breath alone could ward off an army of vampires. No thanks!

Value: 3\/5

Only their noodles and BBQ are of good value and quality... everything here is quite experimental and better for larger groups. They give $1\/$2 discount on every item for members.

Chinese cabbage dumplings were $12.98\/12... that's $1 each! Not the brightest idea. They don't taste that special. Their customized noodles are better priced. Totally would not recommend their dumplings at all. Felt like it was a total ripped off.

Luckily their build your own noodle combo has this really tasty tomato and pumpkin fish soup with green onions, cabbage, mushroom and bean curb as optional ingredient base and a choice of 5 toppings from a total of 36 to choose from, for only $12.50. That and the decent live music is the only draw to this place now... 'cause they only accept CASH, anything else has 3% service charge added... yikes!!Fine restaurant.  Deco is simple but original. The crew is friendly and helpful.  Food is tasty and the prices are more than correct.  Their room called Pai market where you can have a coffee waiting for your pickup order is cute as a button.We tried a variety from this place including a plain glazed, cake with chocolate and sprinkles, glazed cake, and white cream filled with chocolate icing. Definitely better than something you would pick up at a grocery store. In terms of an independent place though, all of the doughnuts were very dry and not soft or fluffy in the middle. For the same price, there is another place in the area just a short drive away that we would pick. Glad to have tried it though, might stop back for a second attempt hoping our first impression was maybe an end of day batch as we were there on a Sunday afternoon.This place is alright. There's nothing special. It's a nice place to get a quick boba fix. Their boba is just alright. 

Whenever I go at night, it's always super busy. During the day, it's a lot slower and much quieter. They have a ton of options for their food which includes lots of appetizers such as crispy chicken, crispy squid or french fries. In my opinion, the french fries are way overpriced.  

Their juicy steak is pretty good. I usually get half pepper and half mushrooms. It is a huge steak, and they will put noodles on top which is delicious! 

I usually come here to chat with friends and just play cards or hang out. 

The service is usually horrible as most of the workers do not speak English well. It's better just to point at things. Don't expect great service because they won't give it to you. The food is so so.

The last time I went, I ordered a milk tea. My friend ordered a Jasmine Milk Tea with boba. The price was higher than I thought, and I assumed with a new menu meant that prices went up. However, the girl charged for boba. She already made the drink, and I didn't want to create a huge fuss and demand a new drink. It was a minor inconvenience, though.Horrible, don't come here.  Service is the worst, 50-60% of the menu items they don't even have available.  Zero common sense, I hope this place goes out of business.Know this first; they do not accept cash. 

I've had lunch there on numerous occasions and was never disappointed with the food or the service at the counter.

It was here that I was introduced to Spam Musubi, a happy little "sandwich" made of sticky rice and marinated spam that is held together with a band of nori (seaweed).  It is quite wonderful.

I've sampled most of their Poke bowlsand have loved them all, but the one thing that reached into my dreams is their Alohavocado.  It takes almost nothing to make but the richness of the avocado against the flavour of honey-sweetened sour cream makes me want to pick up a Uke and emigrate to the beautiful island.

Did I say that they don't accept cash? It's weird and a total turn-off to me but I'm old-school like that. You're hip though, so it's prolly no big deal.Ordered a Calzone from this place and it was ROCK HARD. Then a co-worker pointed out to me that its because its pre-made. Gross!! The only good thing about this place is their soda.After reading Sergey's review, I stalled coming here for a while.  I'm glad I decided to take a chance on my health and try this place.  My stomach loves me at the moment.  We ordered a large sashimi platter to go and I will have to say it's possibly the best sashimi platter in the GTA West I've tried so far. 

With an incredibly sweet and motherly tone on the phone, they took our order and told us they only needed 20 minutes to put together the platter.  Most places usually request 1 hour at least.  Bonus points for them for being quick!  When we went there, we saw the voice on the phone and she was a very lovely woman who clearly just wanted us to be happy with our order.  Though we haven't taken a bite yet at that point, my stomach was already salivating. 

The sushi chef did a great job and for those who are uninitiated with the whole head to tail of sushi, this sushi chef is not afraid to show you how fresh the sashimi is.  We had a great wide variety of fresh and tasty pieces.  Tuna, tuna tataki (with it's mind blowing smokiness), salmon, wild salmon (it's leaner and more red but it's also a sweeter tasting meat than the usual Atlantic fat salmon), ika (squid and it wasn't gooey!! It was clean, smooth and wrapped around a creamy avocado), hamachi, ama ebi (real raw shrimp with the heads!! that's what I mean by fresh... heads included but they're detached), tai, white tuna, and another fish that I'm not familiar with but tasted like butter but looked like mackeral (?).  

The presentation was top notch and it really showed the chef cared about his product.  Some pieces weren't so large but the quality more than made up for this.  The best thing was that this is the most affordable platter in the GTA West.  I've compared this to Toshi, Sushi in Sushi, Dai Ichi, Sushi 4 Me, Hinote, JJ, Sushi Tei, Kumai, and Prince Sushi.  Honestly, Sushi House beats them all for flavour, presentation, price, variety and quality.  Only Toshi comes close but they don't have a full sashimi platter and they're more expensive.

I honestly will keep coming back for more and try other items.  This is my new go to place for Japanese!  Like I said, my stomach is so happy with me at the moment and it's craving to go back.We came in for lunch here. The restaurant has two levels. We we're group of 9 adults and a kid. The place was pathetic. We were not given napkins or silverware. The green tea came in plastic cups because they said their dishwasher did not come today. The pho was poor and trying to eat with aplastic spoon was a challenge.
Would not recommend this place for service or food!A pretty good restaurant for its price range. Not the quietest place, but good for family\/group gatherings. Service is quite good

Food: come in large portions with a very reasonable price 

They give you free red bean soup as dessert. It's really tasty too. (If u like sweet stuff that is lol)Good value always especially at happy hour for 1\/2 price rolls There is not a premium on freshness as most of the clientele are not experts. However for a good lil country boy like me the price point and quality are exceptional for the daily fix . The meals I have enjoyed here were even better as the Mgr Tammy and the servers are great. Owner is rarely out on the floor as he trusts his staff and they deliver daily. Well worth the time and priceThis place is wonderful! I had the egg whites veggie omelet and it tasted fantastic! I find it cool that you can see them preparing your food in the back, gives me a reassuring feeling. It could use more seats but since winter is coming, sitting outside won't be a problem. Quality food for the price.We went with a group of 14 people. Nothing but friendliness. Imagine a restaurant in America where the waitress brings everyone water along with other drinks - thats pretty cool. 

Velvet soup was recommended to us by friends and was great order a bowl and share with atleast 6 people. The Anthony's noodles and General Tso's chicken was superb.

menu prizes are very very reasonable - Don't miss this placeFor prime ribs' lovers, this is the place. I love Lawry's so much and gotta come here once a month just for their prime ribs. The dinning room is beautifully decorated, roomy, classic and elegant and great atmosphere as well. I always get seated right away upon my reservation. The staff is always quick, attentive, nice and absolutely professional.

The prime ribs here are absolutely delicious, tasty, juicy and tender. The seasoning is perfectly right, very consistent quality every time. The meat is so buttery soft, it's just melting in your mouth. Soooooooo yummy!!! I promise if you come here once, you won't go anywhere else for prime ribs no more. Their famous spinning bowl salad is always fresh and flavorful, I love it so much. It comes with your order as well as 2 sides of your choice. I usually got creamed corn and creamed spinach and extra mash potato are the 3 items to die for (OMG! They are soooooo goood). We also order lobsters, asparagus, mushrooms and of course their delicious deserts like creme brulee, hot fudge ice cream sundae. They are very tasty and my absolutely favorites.

I always have a wonderful experience dining here. It is the best prime ribs restaurant I've ever had. Top notch quality food and fantastic customer service.I haven't eaten here in years and decided to come back to something familiar because I'm very confused by all the korean fast food choices on the strip that are encased in foggy windows obscured by hand-written signs (don't get me wrong - they are charming, I just need a guide to go there). 

But back to Il Bun Ji... I was very pleased with the speedy arrival of the food - I should note it was 4 in the afternoon and there were three other tables present.

we ordered the classic comfort food, katsudon, which was among the better ones I've had in the city. it was really delicious and comparable to ones i've had in japan. we also ordered kimchi jigae (spicy tofu stew), which was really really hot and tasty, but not my favourite in korea town. homemade beef dumplings and yam rolls rounded out the meal. 

all in all, I was really pleased. it is nicer than many places on the strip. if you like the special sunken tables, they also have a few of these to offer. the day I went, they were playing CBC radio 2, lots of good music.

bill total for two people: $40 incl tip.Leo is an amazing manager. Joy is an amazing bartender. Oswaldo is an amazing server. With these three, you can't go wrong!Unfortunately,  I don't even think this place deserves a 1 star.  I've been here quite a few times over the years and honestly this place has gone down with every visit.  The service just gets worse every time I come and I think I've given this place more than enough chances to change my mind.  It's sad though because honestly they had an advantage over all the other places due to their big patio area which would be the ideal summer hang out.  However, poor customer service always kills the mood.  I won't be coming back.This place has amazing food! This restaurant isn't that impressive from the outside, but inside the staff are very friendly and helpful. I had a Barbacoa taco which was absolutely delicious. The prices are low compared to many restaurants in the area, as well. I highly recommend!I recently completed an 8-day stay here. I am an IHG Club Spire Elite member, and I made my reservation online on the hotel website.

I have been visiting Vegas at least once yearly since 2010 for my work, and in all of my previous stays, I had always avoided staying on The Strip, since I do not gamble, smoke or drink, and do not party, and also because I have no interest in 99% of tourist attractions, and rather, I had always stayed in Old Town, aka Downtown, at the northern end of the city, because I had felt that it would be quieter and more sedate. 

Well, the Palazzo was so well-designed, planned and managed that while staying here I felt even more insulated from the mobs of tourists and drunks than I ever had when staying at the much smaller hotels in Old Town!

I advised the hotel up front that I would want an early check-in (early PM). I arrived at the hotel at about 1 PM and was immediately guided to the special check-in desk for IHG club members in the lobby. Check-in was speedy and efficient, and I received a King Bed nonsmoking suite on the 11th Level. 

The room, and the hotel, turned out to be amazing and beyond expectations. Overall, this is an excellent 5-star hotel. Everything about my stay was great. My room was extremely large, was immaculately clean and spotless, and was extremely well-maintained; it looked and felt new. 

Here are some more notes regarding my stay, in no particular order:

-- the hotel lobby, all common areas, and all hallways were spacious, airy, well-lighted, well-designed, and were immaculately clean and spotless, and all areas were extremely well-maintained. 

-- elevators were numerous and plentiful and large, bright, and very fast. 

-- the lobby, and adjacent areas, including the shopping mall, offer a wide variety of comfortable seating areas, and so, even if the lobby is crowded, it's always possible to find a quiet place somewhere in the hotel complex to meet with a client or colleague.

-- all of the hotel staff whom I encountered, including front desk staff, housekeeping staff, and security staff, have been very friendly and helpful, and they seem happy: they all seem to enjoy their jobs. 

-- there are plenty of AC outlets in all areas of the room.

-- WiFi was free and very good.

-- housekeepers are very respectful of the "Do Not Disturb" door sign if you hang it on your door. Housekeepers are very helpful and very respectful in general. Best of all, every housekeeper with whom I interacted spoke very good English, which made communication easy!

-- my room was extremely quiet. I never hear sounds from other rooms, nor from the hallway, nor from outdoors.

-- the heating\/cooling system in my room was great; I couln reliably dial in any temperature that I desired from 60 degrees to 85 degrees F (I normally kept it at 77 degrees, because I like a warm room.) 

Bottom line: Excellent 5-star hotel. I recommend it highly! I will return next year.

Hints and tips: Make sure you belong to the IHG club prior to making your reservation; even better if you are an Elite member. Always make your reservation via the hotel website (or IHG website) or by calling the IHG or hotel reservation line, and never via 3rd party online discounters.I am very fussy. Now I work in the mall and eat there constantly. Ate the fried shrimp dish at the bar menu. Wonderful, 5.00. Fast service. Then I ate their brunch menu eggs benedict were excellent. Sicillian omlet had speghetti sauce in it. Was shockedl but that was my one mistake. I am sicillian by the way. Just didn't expect sauce in my eggs. Anyway salmon salad is great. Italian dishes are wonderful too. Next trying sandwhiches. They look good in the pictures. Fast service. Polite waiters. Bend over backwards for you. I eat at the bar if I only have a short lunch. I cant get that quality at fast food for 5.00. Thats only at the bar though. Id like to sit at Bravos one day all day. I think they should have a buffet for me so I could do that.We love this new French restaurant located in the heart of a Waxhaw. I lived in France for 10 years and my husband is French! The quality of food is superb, the ambience is modern & sophisticated and the service on point and discrete!  We love the overall experience!Ok kids, this one is sort of good, bad and ugly.  I don't like to be a negative Nancy like that one blogger chick who always tries to hate on this fast food or that fast food place to further her vegan dirty stinky hippy agenda; but this one is a very honest account of our trip.

Went for brunch on a Sunday.  The line was rather slow moving, and they were slow to seat people.  Nothing makes a sad panda like waiting in a line at a restaurant while staring at empty tables.  After our 45 mins in line, we were seated, way far away from the food.  The room shape and design is, well...weird.  You either get a seat right at the line, or off in Siberia.  Clearly it is better than the goolag I guess?  -1\/2 star only because price was fair.

The food - The portioned offerings are cute and rather unique.  However, they seem to present a challenge to the staff in keeping the plating process moving as throughout the entire meal we spent more time standing there waiting on an item or skipping it entirely because we could not get it than we ever have before.  "Ain't nobody got time fo dat!" -1\/2 star.  Some of the dishes, like the street tacos, fried chicken, bacon mac n cheese were pretty darned good.  The majority of the oddly non-brunch selection were average to just gross.  There was an omelette bar (which turns into the street taco bar after brunch is over which was a positive moment for me) with an incredibly limited selection of items for your egg dish.  That and the vat of over done bacon really made up the breakfast portion of "brunch"; kinda whack -1\/2 star

Water-They have "bottled water" on your table.  It is literally non-filtered and chilled tap water.  Talk about putting lipstick on a pig.  I'm kind of spoiled when it comes to tap water where I live, so I expect decent water when you are going to put it in a bottle and leave it on my table.  It was nice to have that water available though, since our "beverage" only got refilled once.

Service-The waitress we had must have run over her new puppy when leaving for work or something.  All she did was mope around the room trying to look busy while other waitstaff pitched in to help her, resulting in terrible service for lots of tables.  Many of us were "cross table talking" about the manager needing to pay attention.  But he was busy trying to mack it up to the cashiers we found out (which was why they were so slow about ringing people up and knocking the line out).  Now, I am compassionate; I dunno what her issue was, maybe she honestly did get bad news; but it is the managers job to ensure quality service, not hit on the girls that are probably younger than his daughters. -1\/2 star

Clientele - One bonus of hitting any of the more "upscale" properties' buffet is exactly this.  Call me an elitist, my Mom would, it's ok.  A justification for spending the extra $$ isn't just food quality, because as we learned at Cosmo, sometimes that is still a crap shoot (lol no pun, no one got sick).  The people were all very friendly, and I didn't feel like I needed hand sanitizer after getting my plate and touching the same spoon "that person" had just used.  Also not shewing away all the unattended children you encounter at the cheap places (lol at the line and your table) is nice; I really don't want to eat with the back of my mind telling me some kid had already fondled that wonton.Such good authentic Mexican food!!!  Are kids loved it salsa is awesome and the service was A++++ will go there again when in town!!Love everything about the place. Great service...decor....live music and the location is great...anyone in the city can get to this place....Did I mention the food!.....Excellent!

Started off with the pao de queijo ....sort of like mozzerella sticks but better,,,the are triangle in shape, Perfectly breaded and fried with a great sauce to go with it. Entre options are extensive.....this was my 1st vivit here so I settle on the xim xim. A blend of shredded chicker and shrimp within an orange stew mixed with rice,peanuts,carrots.....absolutely delicious. I was skepticle since Im not the buggest fan of shrimp but I was very surprised and the dish did not disappoint. 

Our server was excellent as well. Place seemed to pick up around 4pm on Sunday. Perfect place for a date with the girlfriend or wife....also good enough to take the kids or family our for dinner as well.Your typical bar\/restaurant, except $4 martinis all day wednesday. I only go for the cheap martinis, so I cannot comment on the food.

==========

EDIT: my friend says the chicken rose is pretty goodI've previously written a review on All Star, and stated that it is my absolute fave place for wings. Now this place comes to a very close second.
Please note that Puck n Wings have many location however this review is only reflecting food and service quality at this specific location. I'm in general not a fan of other Puck n Wing restaurants. So if All Star is packed, we'd drive all the way to this location instead of going to a location close to us.
I recon this location might need some fixer upper for it's decor. Everything seems pretty old and grimy. And for some odd reason, it's always pretty dark and gloomy inside. For all thing considered, it really stand a chance against other well packaged restaurants close by.
Once you give it a chance, the wings will impress you and make you want to come back. Their wings are a good size, so you get your money worth. Flavour is addictive. Instead of an overwhelming selection, you choose from a smaller selection of pretty damn good flavours. 
It's pretty specious. good for a backup when everywhere else is totally packed - hidden treasure!Was not worth what I paid for. Green curry with tofu $10.99. tofu was fried and soggy, I would have preferred fresh and firm. It consisted of tofu, bamboo shoots, diced carrots, peas, rice and and a very light green curry broth. It would not surprise me if the the peas and carrots were canned, it was a simple dish. I would have given a better review if the curry cost a few dollars less. Not much taste and soggy tofu. The mango and sticky rice is a large portion for $7.99, but It definitely didn't need a rotten mint leaf garnish. The mango was good and there was a lot of it. Good points- it has great ambience, entertainment, and is very clean. It just seems that food quality and fresh ingredients are not a top priority at Krung Siam. $20 before tip for green curry and a mango sticky rice dessert.  Strike one for me.My daughter Ava and I decided a little daddy\/daughter sushi was the choice for lunch today. We never have been to Sushiholic, but the reviews were good on Yelp so in we went. 

It is a cool looking little place in a strip center at 40th St and Camelback. Ava decided she wanted to sit at a table instead of the sushi bar.

Our server was very nice and even, after we ordered, told us what we ordered fit within one of the lunch specials and would save us a few dollars. That was a cool gesture.

We started with edamame. It came out hot, which we liked. It was salted well and tasted good.

Of course the lunch choice was sushi! Ava wanted California rolls. I also ordered us spicy tuna rolls, and tuna and salmon sushi. 

Ava ate all of the California roll. She said it was awesome! She said that because it tasted yummy and she could eat it with chopsticks.

She did not try the sushi. It was good. Both the tuna and salmon were fresh and had good flavor.

Ava tried raw sushi for the first time trying the spicy tuna roll. She had a number of pieces and liked it! She said this one also tasted yummy and had the right amount of spice to it. 

Ava also tried wasabi for the first time. She started light and steadily increased how much she was using. Ava likes spicy and thought it was great with the sushi.

So it was a most excellent daddy\/daughter lunch adventure. Ava highly recommends you check this place out!This place is great.  I thought the prices were pretty fair.  I got the Linguine Calamari and it was fantastic.  I am such a sucker for fresh squid.  Attentive service and overall good experience.  With prices like these, I will be sure to make my way back here.Very pricey. $11.25 for a small soda a regular sub and a bag of chips. The bread is good. But the sub overall is not so great. The meet is sliced very thin and pressed together. The only condiments are lettuce and a lot of it, tomatoes, a few peppers and a great deal of some sort of Italian dressing that soaks the bread. It certainly was not my best experience at a sub shop but they were quick and very nice. The most frustrating thing about this location is that it is a very small parking lot serving four or five restaurants. The parking spots are small and it is almost impossible to find a space or to get in or out of one as there are five and six people deep waiting for a spaceAttended the Champagne brunch on Saturday, $24 a person for basically all the free mimosas on top of the normal buffet.  And it was quite a normal buffet, even if it was a very vast array of meal selection.  

The desserts are amazing, the little stripe-rolled selection of cakes are perfect and moist.  Their mimosas were pretty delicious and were constantly refreshed by a roving crew with pitchers.  The selection was a major plus too, and there were several major stations with live people actively making you omelettes, mongolian BBQ, or carving you a giant shank of prime rib.  No complaints about the variety.

But certainly about the quality of food -- yes, it's a buffet, and the rigors of long and heated mass-quantity portions means you aren't going to get Mario Batali quality, but more often than not the food came up cold by the time you got back to your seat,  or in the case of most of the Asian noodles,  overdrenched with oil and inedible.   The crab legs were, well, sub-par.

But there were plenty of dishes and we all felt we'd gotten our money's worth at the end of it, for good and for bad.  I certainly would call it the biggest selection near the Strip, but not the best.I have not attended the lunch buffet for this restaurant, so can't comment on that (although generally don't think a buffet showcases the best of a restaurant anyways!).
The "a la carte" items, however, are great. It is a huge menu -  lots of choices, both in meats and vegetarian options. I have eaten in once, and take out a few times. The food is delicious, you can choose your heat level. The portions are generous (especially compared to what I have experienced at other Indian restaurants). 

I don't recall all of the items I have had, but a few that stood out: veggie samosas, baingan bharta (eggplant dish), naan bread, butter chicken, tandoori salmon.

service: very friendly, attentive
decor: leaves something to be desired....the only reason I took off a star.
take out: love that they use re-usable containers!  you get credit for bringing them back to the restaurant as well.
delivery: yes, from justeat.caWe are huge fans of Butcher by Nature and were excited to hear that the same folks were opening up a Smokehouse as well!  

We did not go on opening day, anticipating that it would be too crazy - but overall, the pulled pork and brisket were fantastic and portions were sizable enough for me to have to waddle home (ours came with sides of cole slaw - cream sauce or vinaigrette, and baked beans).  Prices were high for BBQ but not too ridiculous - if you are already shopping at Butcher by Nature, surely they wouldn't suddenly be selling cheap meat?!

The restaurant is still getting through opening hiccups - getting stock right (they were out of specific sauces), taking orders - but I anticipate that they'll figure it all out.  The seating area is also fairly crowded - but someone told me they are opening up the adjacent spaces up for dining area, so that should help as well.One of my go-to places for Korean food. My girlfriend likes their Pork Bone Soup and side dishes. I ordered a Jajang Noodles.

The Noodles come with the sauce scooped onto the side, tossed with seafood (small mussels and squid) and comes with two (regular sized) mussels and topped with an egg. I like to cut up the egg and then mix everything together.

The flavour of the sauce and noodles are tasty but I find the seafood bits themselves sometimes better than others. I like how there's plenty of sauce, and the texture of the noodles.Our last meal in Vegas found us walking into Julian Serrano out of sheer convenience.  If you've read any of my reviews at ARIA, you'll know that I couldn't wait to leave, much less rush back to my room after an uninspiring massage to check out and leave my bags with the porter because they were "unable" to extend an additional hour to me to enjoy the spa facilities after my treatment.

Anyhow, we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of our meal and service at Julian Serrano.  We noticed that a different server brought out each of the dishes, and our drinks were replenished immediately.  (Managers seemed friendly, courteous and comfortable, not uptight and angry-looking like others around the hotel.)  Spanish tapas are quite different from, say, Italian preparations.  So, one should not disparage the Pan Manchego and expect chunky bruschetta.  The Pan Manchego was a perfect start with excellent flavor.  In fact, pretty much everything we ordered was excellent.  The gazpacho came with the vegetables chopped up and elegantly arranged in a bowl, over which the waiter then poured the puréed tomato base (again, not chunky as we might be used to).  Tuna tiradito was nice, but very small portioned.  Hubby asked the waitress if there were live octopi in the back because the dish we had was the freshest and most tender pieces we've ever had.  I've already forgotten what else we ordered, but I do remember the luscious chocolate cake, which was molten in the middle and paired with a mango sorbet.  Nothing spectacular or out of the ordinary, but a simple and good ending to the meal.  What a relief to have experienced this finally during our stay.  If only the rest of the ARIA resort was operating at this level...HI QYPE, LEARN HOW TO SPELL PITTSBURGH!


 What an awesome neighborhood joint. As an out of towner I was lucky to get taken here! No frills food, drinks and company. Great jukebox with a wide selection and lovely waitresses that don't ask if you want another drinkthey ask if you want another pitcher.


 It's set on the main strip in the neighborhood and has a great feel. Even my first time here I felt super comfortable, nice dive bar feel without being superdivey.


 Make sure and tag the chalkboard in the womens bathroom, much mor civilized than a sharpie!Really excellent new Thai spot in the northwest. Service was on point and the food was superb. No alcohol, but their teas and coffee are also perfect.Good menu + happy hour specials, a nice dog friendly patio with live music, weekend brunch is great too.  What's not to like ?Disappointed. I gave this place two shots, one being the other night, and it just didn't get any better...

I want to first point out that the atmosphere\/ambiance is trendy yet casual...almost makes you feel like you're on vacation. This is an establishment that Rocky River needed in order to spice it up a bit. Although our server seemed a bit inexperienced with menu specifics (it's all good, though), we were promptly served in the mist of a busy dining room.

Now, here's where it gets a bit more complicated. We first ordered guac that came with the chip mixture (tortilla, yucca, plantain). Although the guac and chips were delicious--the best part of the meal actually--the guac serving was pretty small for a hungry party of four. Wish we were told that they were small portions.

The rest of the food was, sadly, pretty awful. The taco selections (some $3, others $4) sounded interesting and unique on paper, but it just didn't...work. Two people ordered the chipotle mushroom taco and both commented that the mushrooms tasted "off," nearly "rotten." Perhaps the goat cheese did not mix well with the type of mushroom, but both couldn't finish their meals because this taco was off-putting. I had the zucchini and charred corn taco, which was pretty tasty, but not worth the money. I wished that they offered corn tortillas as opposed to flour; it could have helped the flavor. The rice side was too salty and was loaded with onions. No ice in the water. No sauce toppings for the tacos. Domestic beers were overpriced (Miller Light = $4.50). I'm sorry to unload, but I'm just being honest.

I hope that Bomba quickly improves. Rocky River needs a place like this, but the prices are unreasonable for the portions\/quality of food. As of now, I will head to Barrio for their tacos. Not sure if third times a charm...This place is pretty good. Their mac n' cheese is so good....i usually get the "pick two" deal and pair the mac n' cheese with a half sandwich. Plenty of food. I have to say though, some of the sandwiches are very sad. But some are outstanding. For instance, i love Frontega Chicken. But my friend ordered some type of turkey sandwich and it was so plain looking. It came on plain sliced bread, no exciting veggies or anything. Very boring. So its a hit and miss depending on what you get. I love that you have the option of either apple or chips.One word - yummy!!!

They have a few tables in the front and we actually ate in. It was cozy and had an understated elegance with friendly, detail oriented service and superb presentation.  

As for the food, the Naan is among the best I've had and the tamarind sauce for the Onion Bhaji was delightfully playful.

Will definitely add it to my list of faves.The place is overall good. The food is good. The service is satisfying. The location is phenomenal, since you have that amazing view of the Las Vegas strip. The only negative thing I could say about this place is that the décor is a bit outdated. Then again, you get that feeling that you're in a true Mexican restaurant.First visit here and I can not find any faults.  The place is nicely decorated and in great shape.  I only say this because so many Chinese restaurants I go to look like they never repair or update their furnishungs.  The menu has all the popular items but is not overly huge.  We ordered egg drop and wonton soups and then  Mongolian beef and Curry chicken.  Everything was served in a timely manner, looked great and tasted even better.  Very happy we decided to drive a little farther for this experience.  I think too many times we settle for what is convenient instead searching for betterLove this place! The coffee is great, they have many creative concoctions--it's fun's to read the menu! I haven't eaten here yet, but I intend to soon. The folks who work here are incredibly nice and accommodating. I would rather go here than Starbucks any day!I meet a running group Saturday mornings at the church across the street from this Smoothie King and I audibly gasped several months ago when I saw it had opened. Funny thing is I didn't stop in until today.

I'm not sure how long ago the location in Old Town closed, but I used to love it and frequented it. I was sad when it went bye-bye.

This location is just like I remembered. There's several smoothies that I like and there's a ton of variety. Some of my favorites include Angel Food, Peach Slice Plus & Power Punch. I actually got something new today. I forget what it was called, but it was simply the one where you pick a fruit (I went with mango), nonfat yogurt, vanilla, and like one or two other things. 

Luckily it wasn't very crowded when I popped in. Like someone else mentioned, there's only two employees working at a time and I can see where things can get backed up if it's busy. 

I also noticed they do a thing on Fridays where 32 ounce smoothies are $5. I'll be back.If Cafe Nordstrom existed outside of the mall, I would eat here every single day!

Everything on the menu is AMAZING. My favorite entrees are the salads. I have never had a more difficult time choosing a salad. My favorite is the salmon salad, but they are all good! The soups are just as tasty. The tomato bisque is out f this world and the garlic crouton it comes with is just as delicious. Also, to finish it all off, if you have not had a magic bar they are a must try!

If you haven't eaten at Cafe Nordstrom, skip the food court and do yourself a favor and try it. You will not be disappointed, especially after a long day of shopping.Dear god I'm fat.

OK. That's not true. In fact, I've lost weight since moving out to this here Valley of the Sun. But that doesn't mean Oregano's doesn't try to suck me into obesity every dang time I'm here. Warning: This review contains lots of yelling, because the food is INSANE.

But first I want to address my one complaint: The bathroom. WHY! Why must there only be one stall?! This place is on a wait circa 5:00 p.m. every night (including week nights), why must I almost pee my pants waiting for the one stall to be vacated?!!? And it's stuffy in there too. Wah.

(Oh yeah, another review talks about this too: WTF is up with the flies in the main room? There's always one buzzing around our table. The place seems clean so...I dunno.)

ONTO THE FOOD.

It's stupid. The portions, how tasty it is, all of it. It's just dumb. Favorites include:

-Deep dish Sproccoli pizza: Are you kidding me?! I could barely finish one piece, and it's not like I didn't want to eat more. I was just STUFFED. The thin crust ain't nothin' to sneeze at, either. And make sure they take the bucket-o-parm and sprinkle it over your pie. YUM.

-Guacatony: Why. Why do they need to over-stuff the large ramekin holding the Italian-herb-laced guacamole so it spills all over the crispy perfection of cheesy-toasty "chips"?! WHY?! Because they want me to weigh a deuce, that's why!!!!!

-The veggie sandwich: WHAT WAS THIS MONSTROSITY?! PILES of grilled veggies and cheese (Provolone AND goat cheese, who's counting?), basil, and since I don't dig aioli all that much I ordered a side of marinara to go with it for dipping. I am a sandwich bandit and I could only deal with half of it. 

-Pesto Penne Bake: How is this? And why is this? Pesto pasta and sundried tomatoes and cheese BAKED INTO A BREAD BOWL WHY. 

-Boyfriend's favorite salad on Earth is the Pablo Picasso salad. Also, a "small" version of this is roughly the size of a football field. I'm afraid of the regular-sized one. I fear it.

-The lunch "slice" (2 big slices) with their awesome house salad (homemade Italian dressing = savior) is a STEAL.

I'm faint just typing this all out. My love of Oregano's truly exhausts me. I think I need to make a trip soon to regain strength.Apart from the nice ladies in slim dresses, the food has no importance, rememberal flare.

The Nacos, we're fantastic, the cheese was plentiful and the chicken on it was very tender. The burger, was just.....a burger; featuring all your normal burger toppings. The bun which was served on was kinda hard and flakey. Nor was that all, when our waitress brought our drinks her hair was in the drink. With out knowing, she gave proceeded to the next table and gave them their drinks, with the hair. 

Moreover, You should just try a restaurant in the new food court.So good! Best margaritas in the universe for real!
Civeche delightful!! I would come here again and I'm hard to please.I'll write a more expansive review later, but this place is legit Monterrey style tacos. Menu is very limited, but everything is good.Don't waste your money here.  There are better Italian restaurants to go to.  Most of the staff are young and not customer focused.  We had spaghetti with marinara sauce.  The pasta was gummy and sticky and the marinara sauce was very spicy and made what was already bad worse.  We also had the penne with vodka sauce.  This had no flavor at all and had very little sauce on it.  No bread was served which is odd for an Italian restaurant.The food was subpar. I ordered a chicken sandwich, they brought me a burger and it was like the kind you ordered from a high school cafeteria, horrible!!!! The waiter was amazing and so apologetic, polite, great with the kids.
He got the manager who was rude and unapologetic, said he guessed people liked cafeteria chicken burgers. My friends mussels were half missing, I'll note he did go back and get her more and offered to take my burger but didn't say what he was going to do but at that point I was so turned off I told him not to worry about it.
The bathrooms were disgusting. There was no toilet paper in 2 of the 3 stalls which we mentioned to a staff member using the facilities and she just said "oh well I don't know who handles that" and walked away! The soap pumps were broken and you had to stick your hand in them to get soap. 
I'm not a foodie and I'm not picky either so when I say keep walking past this place I mean it!!!We stopped in here for a drink before dinner, and I'm so glad we did! I had heard about it from a friend, and we decided to give it a whirl during Cornelius day.

The parking is easy, and you can enter from the lot or the street-facing side, which has a few tables with umbrellas and comfy looking outdoor couch with chaise. We sat inside at the bar, and at 4:00 on a Saturday afternoon, there were a few other groups inside, too.

Our bartender, Kat, was so friendly and welcoming, and she went over the menu to give us the lowdown. The fella was pretty excited about a Cigar City collaboration, and as a non-beer girl, I went with a glass of wine (which came in a Riedel glass - ooh la la). 

The atmosphere is casual with the bar, some tables, and a seating area with chairs in the back, and we loved the decor with posters\/signs of The Big Lebowski, Sideways, The Godfather, The Beatles, etc. They have good taste! I even have to comment on the bathroom, which was so clean and spacious and very nicely decorated with a bench and shelves containing knickknacks... like The John Travolta Scrapbook. Nicely done. Oh, and there's free wifi - just ask for the password.

We didn't try any food, but the menu looked fun. Too bad we don't live nearby or this would most likely be a great "usual" spot.$15.25 for a large signature poke bowl and it was about 75% RICE!  Maybe 10% poke and 15% other toppings. The poke was quite bland and forgetful.  Presentation was colourful and the service was friendly though.  Doubt we will go back.Blatant Racism! I wish I could give Casa zero stars. They don't even deserve one. I was there July 30th with two friends celebrating my 21st birthday. It was a Sunday night so the place was dead. We sat down and ordered our drinks. We were sitting right by the bouncer. Two African American men walk up, show their Id's and were turned away because of the SHOES one guy had on. These men were dressed nicely and were being polite JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE!!! The bouncer became cocky and laughed as he turned away the two men at the gate. I have never in my life experienced such blatant racism. If this is how CASA treats human beings, they deserve to be shut down. It's sad that in 2017 this is happening. My friends and I walked right out after the two men were turned away. I will never spend a single penny at this bar.The best Rosemary beef sandwich in the whole city. Just a heads up you going to be ready to wait in line for at least half an hour no matter what time of the day it isReally good food.  Had the obligatory chicken tikka masala and the paneer tikka masala, veg samosas, plain naan, papadums.  All very good!!  Ordered two desserts (kheer and the little honey donut balls) and they were five bucks each for two tiny donuts and a very small kheer.  That was sort of ridiculous for a $10 delivery fee and a 20% tip added at the time of ordering.  So I highly recommend the food - but the desserts are extremely overpriced.  I would most definitely order the entrees again though.Nonna's Oven has been around for a while now and I really enjoy this place as a casual eatery; if I am in in the area. 

I find their pasta dishes are probably preferred over their pizza. My favorite is definitely their Friday\/Saturday special - lasagna.  If you happen to be there on those days - just order it. Trust me. 

Service can be for most part ok - mostly attentive -  but they have forgotten about me a few times for minor things - but nothing glaring enough to make me want to not visit - if I am in the area. 

This place is very busy and they do have a steady flow of people coming in and out of the place. Families; friends night out, etc. 

If you can make a reservation,  otherwise come early to snag a table.The location doesn't look like much, but don't let that stop you. Great service and awesome food. We came looking for good Chicago dogs and happened to come on the right day for a daily special. So glad we did.

*Edit: RE: Previous reviews stating they didn't get real Chicago dogs, with the exception of the bun, this had all the right veggies and condiments and an all beef dog. It was the real deal.Hole in the wall and a must-know amongst Sun Devils.  This place serves up pasties which are essentially the original hot pocket.  They have a wide variety of them from vegetarian to carnivore and none of them will disappoint.  Great place to meet up with a date or a couple friends if you're looking for a good bite and a couple drinks.Nothing special here. The quality and freshness of the fish was acceptable but the side options lacked flavor. The tuna had a metallic taste which put me off. There are plenty of much better options out there that exceed this place in every measurable categoryI tried them for lunch today. They had a great menu with many different dishes from eastern to western cuisine and all vegan. It was clean, cozy, and small but in an intimate way. I ordered the pho and the golden rolls. They were both good the only thing is they use meatless "meat". I personally find dishes without these meats to be better, I  do not like the flavor imitation meat has. The pho broth was very nicely flavored and they give you all the usually fixings and a large size. The golden rolls were crisp and had veggies inside with a sauce on the side. 

The service was good everyone was friendly and overall I would come back to try many of the other dishes I would just opt out of the meat substitute!I don't come here for a year and it went from "will visit when I'm in town" to "hell no!" meaning for the many years, I would be in Vegas twice a year and guaranteed be at this place for lunch. i recommended it to many people who would visit the area. But now, youd have ro pay me to come here.

Where to begin? Lets start with the drink order. Now I understand it being an exotic eatery, but come on, how is it even remotely possible to be out of Pepsi at 12:30 pm on a Saturday afternoon? And they pour it from cans!

Ok, so now we get to order. 3 bowls of the combination pho (#1 on the menu). of these three, one was requested to have no rare steak. one bowl of the seafood combination noodle. 4 sandwiches.

Waitress comes back like 10 minutes later and says that two of the sandwiches we ordered are not served anymore. Then why are they still on the menu? So we have to order different kinds of sandwiches. 

After another 10 min, a server finally starts bringing the pho. She just starts putting them down and we ask which one had no rare steak. She just stares at us blankly and muttered theyre all the same. Ok, no, we asked one to have no rare steak. She just shrugs and walk off! So we just give up and start eating. After another five minutes, the sandwiches arrive. These things are pathetic. They used to be stuffed full of meats and veggies...but now, about a quarter of how much used to be in there. Honestly, after eating the aandwiches, we looked at each other with some pretty sour faces.

Oh, I forgot to talk about the sorry excuse for pho! First, raw red onions...overpowering. Should be half cooked white onions. Two pieces of rare steak. A piece of beef tendon the size of a silver dollar. Couple pieces of tripe each smaller than an earth worm. and a handful of, what i guessed were, meatballs. And maybe a handful of noodles in a tasteless broth. I have never added salt to any pho broth my entire pho-eating life but this was so tastless!

What really drew the line for me was when the check came. They tacked on an 18% gratuity for a party of six! Granted some places do this and its understandable, but theres no mention of it on the menu or anywhere in the place. Gratuity charges are required to be listed somewhere if the establishment adds them automatically for any reason. And whats the cashiers response when we ask it to be removed? Its a temporary menu and it hasnt been listed on there yet. This means the menu is kind of new and there are still items listed on there they dont serve anymore... Something totally didnt seem right about that explanation.

Seems kind of sad that I used to come here guaranteed whenever I was in town and now will never come back. There are many other great places in town to go to. But only come here if you like tasteless food and mystery chargeson your bill.Went in for dinner with my girfriend under their new management. Ordered soft shell crab roll, spicy tuna roll, beef short ribs, and chirashi dinner. The quality is somehow changed, taste is good but when the menu said soft shell crab roll comes in 8 pieces then I expect 8 not 5, told waiter and he went back checking on menu then came back and said 'Yes, it said 8 but it's 5'. Chirashi dinner is also lack of quality, I used to love to order it here a lot before since it was the best I've had in Phoenix but now they ruin it by taking ikura, ika, and unagi out of the bowl. Beef short ribs ($16.95) were over cooked covered in oil and very chewy. Overall disappointed.Best meal in Vegas.  I quizzed the waiter on at least five different dishes I was considering and once he explained what was actually in the dishes, they sounded amazing.  I felt he did a much better job with the descriptions than what was on the menu so be sure to ask questions about the food prep.  We started with sweet potatoes tempura and veggie spring rolls, both were lovely.  Then we moved on to the pepper filet udon noodles which were a more flavorful lo mein and the XO shrimp with extra spice which had green beans, shrimp, rice all in a spicy, bean sauce.  The shrimp dish was the best Asian dish I have ever eaten.  For dessert, we went with the donuts with the dipping sauce which were a great finish to a great meal.  Great, knowledgeable and helpful service.Always fast, always a perfect sandwich, always friendly.  All Jimmy John's reviews are short because, well, they are consistent and always great.Happy Hour all day, everyday at the bar! This is the most important thing you need to know. Don't be fooled by the malicious tables calling your name. Plant your bootay at the bar and gobble up some deliciously priced pizzas, salads, appetizers and booze. ($5 Hoegaarden on tap!)

There is more than enough for a meal on the menu. We had two individual size pizzas, a salad, calamari and a glass of beer for around $30, and the only thing that slightly disappointed was the insalata mista. The dressing was pretty much oil without zing, but the greens were fresh and beautiful. The pizza dough was thin and soft. We had the veggie selection, and it did not have sauce, which my husband missed, but I didn't mind. I still thought the pizza was flavorful with Ricotta cheese. The calamari was tender and came with bonus fried shrimp and little veggies. The batter flavor was spiced nicely. An amazing value for on the Strip, especially at Crystals!

We came in about 30-minutes before closing, and we experienced no attitude. Arriving close to closing time is always a good test of service, as bad servers will glare at you or try to convince you the kitchen is closed. The bartender, who was our server, was friendly and not pushy even after the place had officially closed.

If you happen to have blown all your cash at Miu Miu or Fendi or Kiki or... wherever, sidle up to the bar and enjoy quality happy hour treats!Came here for dinner while in town for work. Ordered the salmon with a side of the corn and thought it was just okay. The two items cost around $42 and then was charged $5ish for a coke. I get that we're in Vegas but this was pretty exorbitant. Service was okay as well. Not sure if it was an off night or what but I was pretty underwhelmed.Amazing. This is the place you take people to show off your Japanese knowledge of food. The sashimi is perfectly prepared. Tried the makeral, octopus and sea bass. Great atmosphere and drink specials. I tried the sake. They have a comprehensive list for beginners to understand.I don't know why I never reviewed this place, but I do know that I have celebrated many important milestones here. Food is solid. Service is genuine. Friends and I always leave full and happy without breaking our bank. There's a lot of parking. Their restrooms are clean. We often order the whole catfish, the crispy duck panang, the nem kao tod, and ask for off menu items. Make it a point to come here if you haven't already.La Boca is back open and it is awesome.  You must check it out.  Rosita is the original owner and she is still running the place.  The just had some changes in the name and food.

I love tapas and there are so many good things to try!GOLFERS BEWARE...

I should have know from my elite Yelp event here that there were issues however I was optimistic that since this place has been open for a few weeks some of those issues would have been resolved.   LMAO NOPE! 

First off we arrive and no valet parking onsite no parking onsite at all.  I do realize that miss USA needed a tent and that wasn't the issue.  The issue lies with having to take a shuttle wasting 20-30 minutes each way. It took the same amount of time for shuttle service than it did when driving from my house!  And yes it's a 106 out. No shuttle stop with a place to sit and the top golf employees didn't understand how the shuttle systems operates.  One guy told us it's an as needed or on demand shuttle so we would have to tell the valet guy.  So we went to the valet guy and he was told two shuttles running with additional stops.  

When we got there we did find our party by the pool.  Which I was told I need a wrist band not sure for what reason but I did know there are a ton on minimum charges for pool and golf depending on the floor and time of day but between three different employees and again ranges of different prices. My friend got the manager and it was somewhat resolved.  I get it it's Vegas that means charging for everything.  If you want to sit by the pool without a bay it's a charge or the bay is a charge then the food and beverage minimum by the pool or bay on the third and fourth floors with a two hour minimum charge for play time.  I get that part but why does no one know their prices!!!! I mean come on they work there.  What a joke. 

My biggest complaint is the lack of communication.  I'm talking communication between staff and their lack of knowledge.  Everyone told us a different story.  This is the same complaint I had during my elite Yelp event. The difference there was I overlooked it since it was free event.We stopped in today for lunch after reading the amazing reviews!  The staff and cooks were so friendly and welcoming and the food was absolutely delicious!  I enjoyed a half order of the bean enchiladas with red sauce and a side of rice and beans and my husband had the enchilada and tamale plate with chicken enchiladas in green sauce and pork tamales with red sauce and a side of rice and beans.  This place is legit and I can't wait to come back and try other items on the menu!If you're visiting Grimaldi's, you're most likely coming from some tasty thin crust pizza.  Time to give this location a shout out

Service:  Very friendly team members throughout my visits.  From the hostess to the server, this location has been consistently on point.  My servers have always been great with keeping the drinks fresh, getting the order correct and to the table quickly.  The manager stopped by our table twice to make sure our dining experience was going well.  I really appreciated the extra effort and attention.

Pizza: '12 regular with pepperoni and sausage is my go to and takes care of my pizza cravings when it pops up. Sauce is always rich but never overwhelming.  The thin crust is and the cheesey cheese  compliment each other well.  I've been to numerous Grimaldi's locations and I've always been happy that their high quality pizzas are consistent  When I'm feeling a little healthy af with my pizza outing, the salads have always been fresh.

This particular location can get busy quickly but they staff has always been on point with great service and turning covers over quickly without rushing patrons.  This is a great pizza spot when you're looking for casual pizza sit down night.  Keep up the great work Eastern Grimaldi's team!  Until next time.... =)If you love diverse fresh local food then this is the place for you. I have been here twice now and each time I have been blown away by how amazing the offerings are. I really like Eliza's Oven. I mean come on desserts that have a verity of alcohol in them. You can't go wrong. Combine that with East End Brewing, Soup Nancy's, and La Palapa you have all the makings of one very delicious shopping trip. You can honestly feel the
passion from all the vendors. I love that they know what they're serving. They know the ingredients and speak to every aspect of the business. If you are like me and love shopping local then I recommend getting here now.Someone had recommended this place to me but unfortunately I did not like one thing we had ordered, in fact everything we had was pretty awful. How can you mess up this type of food if that's what you specialize in? Tasted like one of those low budget Chinese\/Vietnamese buffets to me. Will not be going back.Great cupcakes, pastries, baked goods, and breads.

The workers here are super nice and the shop is clean and cute.

I wish I could have tried more stuff, but I only had the chance to try their cupcakes. They were moist and full of flavor. If you're looking for a sweet treat, make sure to come here. They are also on the outskirts of Uptown Charlotte, so parking is so much easier here.What happened? About a two years ago the pies were great. Now, the dough is old, the toppings skimpy. The drivers always forget the red pepper sprinkles. This review is not based on one order, this is based on the last 5 or so pies bought. This store has been consistently  disappointing. I've called a talked with the store manager a few times. He was very nice and appolgized - but apparently he is running his store cheap and the quality of his product is suffering.  I would recommend that you skip this place and try one of the frozen pizzas in the grocery store.I called in last night to order some food to go.  This was my first time eating food from here.

I give the food a 7\/8 out of 10.  I had "Saucy Balls" (4 meatballs in sauce) and a wedge salad.  

It's apparently impossible to get 2 pork meatballs and 2 beef meatballs.  This is unfortunate because it doesn't let me try a wider variety of your food and also because it's unbelievably easy to accommodate.  I should be able to get 4 different kinds of meatballs if I want.  Seriously?

I didn't eat in the restaurant but it seemed to be having the usual identity crisis that most Pittsburgh restaurants and bars have.  Half upscale, half sports bar.  Nice decor, ESPN on a TV.  Make a choice and stick with it.

My comparisons were easy to make because there's a meatball only restaurant in my town (24th & Meatballs) that does a much better job and has been doing it for longer (i.e. I'm sure this place is probably a rip off).  I have no problem with that but a 2nd generation restaurant has every opportunity to do it better.

I'll give it one more shot.  I'll have to just so I can try a different flavor of meatball.Friendly service and delicious fresh dumplings! Definitely worth a try!I have been going to Sushi Eye ever since it first opened in Tempe and I didn't even like or want to try Sushi 

Then the owners got me into trying different items on the menu.. And just like that i got addicted! Now 7 or 8 years later we still go on a regular but have brought in MANY friends and family who now also have brought in their friends and other family and from anyone we have told to go there or have taken there they are always saying how good it was there and now go every month! 

The owners are also such great people, they treat us just like family, and our son even knows one of them as Sushi Grandma

I recommend this place to anyone near or far to come and try any variety of items at sushi eye.We went here for my fiancé's birthday dinner and even though I love this place it was not for my in laws. Food is great atmosphere is great. Very much a chain restaurant but they look good doing it. There's dancing and entertainment so it's loud but it is a fun night out.Decent coffee and some great cakes and other pastries, but the service could be a bit better. I arrived mid-afternoon on a weekday, there were 5-6 customers and about a dozen empty tables, but every single empty table was littered with dirty dishes. 

It's location is also less than desirable, it's right near the main entrance of the mall and doesn't have a wall\/door separating it from the public areas of the mall.Love this place. Have been here for three times. Tried both premium and signature omakese, the difference is that you don get truffle rice for signature and there's some slightly adjustments on some of fried dishes. Overall is very satisfying for its price. The desert is the best!! I love everything in the plate and is not so sweet for me as well.I have to say that I did enjoy the pan pizza from this location. However, there was 1.5 pieces of pepperoni per slice (yes I counted). 8 slices of pizza, 12 pieces of pepperoni. That was disappointing.This place is a very informal restaurant, but the food is pretty good. Eggrolls were crispy and flaky, not much flavor inside but the texture was good. Stir fry vegetables had good flavor but were undercooked.I wish I could give it more stars!!!

Every time my colleague and I are in Vegas (usually 1-2 times per month) we always make every effort to have at least one meal from Poke Express. It is amazing! It is a small place with no seating so you have to plan to take it to go. But what it lacks in seating it makes up for in flavor. There are so many options. For fish they have tuna, salmon, octopus, eel, and imitation crab. For sauces they have furikake, spicy mayo, spicy avocado, and I am likely forgetting some. We have tried most all of them and have not found one that we didn't like. We also get the seaweed salad and kimchi cucumbers. 

This place also gets huge points for consistency. The fish is always fresh, the store is always clean, and the staff are always friendly! 

We love this place so much that one time we bought insulated bags and ice packs so that we could bring some of the delicious poke back to Reno to share with our husbands. They loved it!The worst farmer boys I've ever been to. This my last resort because the service is so bad and so is the food. Last time I came to dine in no one would take my order even though it was an hour before closing. Then as I left pissed, the employees had the audacity to laugh.Ordered rolls for takeout.  This is my new favourite sushi place in the Church-Wellesley Village!  Their rolls were well made and delicious, their miso soup and salad were both good, and their prices were reasonable.  The only downside was that it took quite a bit longer than they originally told me to make the order.It's Pizza Hut, my expectations were extremely high, the lunch buffet took a bit to get going, but because I was there for the first pizzas out, I cannot say it wasn't freshly made. 

The building is old school Pizza Hut, like I remember loving in middle school, I'm 36 now, so it could use an update. 

Pizza itself was typical Pizza Hut quality, and service was adequate, staff was pleasant. With options like Barros a block away with great lunch specials, PH doesn't really measure up.This place is on the exact opposite side of town from where I live but since I have read nothing but good reviews about this place, I decided to take that trip. I love the decor in this place, it is very modern chique. 

Every there looked delicious so decided to try out several different things. The grilled ham and cheese with pesto sauce had a very unique mixture of flavors. I also tried the "nutella bomb", that dessert just melted in my mouth. The layers of chocolate, chocolate mouse and nutella is to die for! With my friend's advice, I also decided to try the banana cream pie. I usually don't enjoy anything with bananas in it but this piece of pie definitely changed my mind. If this place wasn't so far away from me, I would be there at least once a week to try out every thing on the menu.Ume sushi is conveniently located at yonge and finch. Whether you drop by to dine in or order for takeout, you will not be disappointed. 

Decent menu
Decent prices
Tax included when you order takeout with cash
Patio for a small party available in the summer
Bento boxes or a la carte sushi 
Efficient and good service
Alcohol available 
Cute booths for small parties
SEA URCHIN sashimi or sushi 


If you live close by its definitely worth trying out.We enjoyed the lamb biryani, butter chicken, daal and saag paneer - everything was top notch - this is the best Indian I have ever had in my visits to Toronto.We love this funky, inviting loft and the tea is outstanding. I have about a dozen different teas from the Tea Loft and they are all very good.  Trust Danielle, the owner, to guide you to blends that you may not have considered, but will be happy you did. My favorite is the Gingerman, and for a dessert tea, the Banana Fana is delish.  Inside this warehouse is an oasis of warmth and great vibes.  Go, and drink the best tea you can buy in Pittsburgh.This is a very cute place to grab a coffee or a cookie. Also their brunch menu is good too! I come here to meet friends and to relax sometimes. The atmosphere is calm and low key. It's a good place to study, chit-chat with a friend and whatever you need.This is only an okay Shanghai rest. We ordered the black truffle xlb and a reg xlb. Both tasted the same, the only thing different about them was the appearance, one was black skin and other was white. Don't know what all the hype is about black truffle xlb? We also ordered a shaghai chow mein, portion was small and a order of wor tip. Bill came out to 40 bucks for these 4 dishes. Not worth the price for what you get. Would not come back as there are other Shanghai rest in markham that are better and cheaper.Someone asked the question in the Yelp talk threads where the best place was for fried things, like french fries and onion rings.  Several people said Ted's had great onion rings......so off I went!  

I expected a smaller place but I was pleasantly suprised when I pulled up to a medium sized store.  I was greated with a smile and asked what I would like.  It was a Sunday afternoon so they were not very busy.  I liked the fact that you tell them what you want and they toss it on the grill right in front of you.  Everything is freshly cooked.  They did the same with the onion rings and french fries too.  Everything was fresh and hot.  My daughter had her favorite....a hot dog, which she loved, and fries which were fresh and crisp.  I had a burger and onion rings.  Yes, the onion rings were delicious!  The batter was great and the onions were a little on the sweet side.  My burger was cooked to perfection.  

This is another great little place we will go back to.  It's also sort of near my work so maybe I'll get out one day and go here for lunch.  Thanks Ted's and Yelpers!It was a hike at 4am trying to find this place but once I found it it did not disappoint. It was a long line but It was efficient and the slices are big. It really hit the spot after drinking. I recommend the sausage with banana peppers and the white pizzaOverall, we preferred the Southern Highlands location of Rise and Shine in terms of access, service and quality.  The Flamingo location is difficult to access for anyone with a handicap.

The food is average and does not reflect the prices when compared to comparable menus at other restaurants.  Service was less than average when we were there on a weekday, mid-morning.Aliante Station & Casino is the closest casino to my house. Hubby and I eat here occasionally. Prices are good. Place is clean. Staff is friendly. They have a good salad bar and otherwise a good selection of foods. I always get a big plate of salad and something else I find appetizing.Cute wait staff, great patio. The husband and I went for lunch we ordered nachos and a basket of cajun fries. The food was delicious and more than enough for the 2 of us, couldn't even finish the fries we were stuffed.I think this place and I are going to be friends.  There was a delicious salad of greens, dates, pine nuts and toasted manchego cheese which made an excellent entree with chicken added, and was satisfying without leaving me unpleasantly stuffed.  Of course, i went and spoiled that virtuous feeling by ordering a crepe Suzette for dessert, but it was to die for, so it's not like I regret it or anything.I was really sad when I learned that Salad King burned down last year.  When I found out it was re-opening down the street I was very happy as this is one of my favourite Thai places in Toronto.

My brother and I dropped in and were stuck behind a large lineup.  We walked to the front to get our name on the waiting list and were lucky that they had a seat for 2 immediately.

If you've never come here you'll find out quickly that there are a lot of tables but they will seat you side by side with others.  We were added to a table for 6 and it seemed the 4 were not all together.  We sat down and looked around to the new place.  It looks a lot bigger than it did before.

Our server dropped by with menus and some water and we had a quick chat about graffiti.  After looking over the menu we got some skewers, mango salad and I ordered the Golden Curry with Chicken...5 chilli's.  

Our appetizers came out fairly quickly and we started with the mango salad.  I had a gut feeling it was the wrong time to order this and I was right.  The mango's were pretty sour, a lot more sour than I like.

The skewers were up next and I loved these so much.  The beef was cooked perfectly and the peanut sauce is very good.  A lot of beef skewers I order are usually overcooked, not at Salad King!

It wasn't long until our mains came out and boy did it look and smell delicious.  I poured some of the curry and other goodness over the rice and I could pick up this amazing smell of all the ingredients.  Upon my first bite it was the same Salad King I had remembered.  The meal was great...and did I mention the price is amazing?

Our server was really friendly and really nice.  I can't wait for my next visit!The food here is really mediocre.  A salad is a salad, a pile of lettuce.  Our server was very nice, and was trying to over compensate for the food being so so....ice tea is great!I give them a zero for the worst  customer service. I ordered for pick up and was told it would be ready in 25 minutes. I pay and wait and after 30 mins I ask a lady where my order is and she tells me it is going to be 30 mins and there are 4 tickets before me. I ask for the money back and go to the cashier. He asks me what's wrong and I tell him it has been 30 mins and I am told it was going to take another 30. I give him my card for refund. He throws the card at me and tells me he cannot refund to my card and tells me I lied. He yells at me and is super rude. Last time I will be supporting a business who has no customer service skills.Just wonderful.  The best Indian food around here.  My first time yesterday.   I'm gonna no back there today too.  I had pani puri and daal.  Today I'm buying more to introduce the good good to my friends.Ooh la la!! Try the crab with the trifecta sause *cajun, garlic, lemon pepper*. My mouth is still zinging with joy, and I may wait to brush my teeth! Server was thorough, friendly, and knowledable. WIll go back for sure.  Priced better than Joe's crab shack.Nothing like starting the day with a barely warm cappuccino. Seriously, there's just no excuse for that. First time I've ever one I've ever sent a coffee back. If the cups are cold, warm them up first, or store them on top of the espresso machine! 

Seriously, you have got to get the basics right, or the rest of the place is going to be in trouble. The granola was meh. And "out of oatmeal" at 730am Saturday morning?Ok  so They are mediokre at best.  Have no idea how to do Catering or folow threw with orders could not even get it right  and ruined our lunch party.   I would not recomend them  I only hope they do better with others in the future  Very DissapointedTablemade guacamole was delicious! I had a vegetarian combo that was also very good. Location was a bit dark and could have been cleaner, but the service and food was very good.I was thrilled to find out that there was a vegan bakery in town! Upon pulling up to the parking lot, I began to question my decision. The inside selection was minimal, but I was able to custom order a peanut butter cake w\/ chocolate frosting for my girlfriend's birthday. They were also willing to draw on a beautiful mandala design on said cake. Initially, I wasn't sure about the size of the 6in cake, but we got a good 12 pieces out of it. Cake was definitely dense, but moist. The icing also offset the denseness a bit. I feel that Phoenix has a smaller community of local vegan, so I'm pleased that Treehouse Bakery exists. With friendly and accommodating staff and deliciousness all around, I'll definitely be back and recommending to friends.Their portion of their food is huge. Service is good! They offer biscuits b4 u eat ur ordered foodOf all the things you can get here my favorite is the thin crust cheese pizza!
other things are great too but the crust and sauce are so good I can eat just a cheese pizza and be happy. I prefer not to sit on the patio because of the cheap chair they use but other than that is it good food.MoRoCo Chocolat is a unique restaurant found in the heart of Yorkville. It is beautifully decorated and you enter into a 'chocolate salon' one that has many exquisite displays of truffles and chocolate covered everything (from cookies to apples). Everything looks delicious, but it is not until you sit down in the 'dining room' where all the excitement begins.

The menu is french cuisine mostly and entrees range from club sandwiches to salmon, or stuffed chicken breast. Having tried a few dishes, the food is pretty good and the quantity is generous for Yorkville. 

The desert menu is absolutely enticing, they have a fondue for 2 or 6 or more, a sipping chocolate and a variety of desserts, the one I tried was the spring rolls (very creative). Spring rolls filled with banana, dark chocolate and peanut butter!! It was so delicious, and very creatively designed! It is an adorable place, you must try it!My experience here was okay. I ate here before going to a concert at The Fillmore. The place was pretty empty for a Friday afternoon. I ordered the chicken quesadilla and a peach margarita. The food was okay, nothing spectacular. My margarita was good! Nothing about my experience at this place stands out, which is why I'm giving them 3 stars.always very quick and extremely polite. i usually only go here as a treat during a bad day at work and they ALWAYS cheer me up.Oh Nora's. You have long been my favorite Italian restaurant in Las Vegas. That was until today. I made an online reservation on March 20 for March 30 at 5:45pm. I called today, March 30, to see if I could change the time. I was told by the snarky hostess that I did not have a reservation. I was also told that I made it for a different day even though I have the email record of my reservation. I hung up to check my email, called the restaurant back, and got the manager. He found the reservation with no problem and confirmed that the time could not be changed. At this point I was a bit put out by the hostess's attitude and we decided to go somewhere else. I called back to cancel the reservation and got to talk to Miss Snarky once again. She was just as snarky as she was before but even more so. Should couldn't find the reservation once again, but finally did using my last name (she never asked me my last name when I called the first time). I thanked her very forcefully for her excellent customer service. Needless to say, you have lost our business for good now.What a fantastic restaurant. We are so lucky to live so close.
The food is great quality. The spice level is amazing. Everything we have tried has come out wonderfully. We like to order a dish and have them add in the mixed vegetables. My only complaint would be that sometimes the to-go orders get slightly messed up, but it's not a big deal.Decently surprised with this chain! Reminds me of Souper Salad, which we have back in Texas. I like how you are able to immediately pick up a plate and start assembling your salad as soon as you walk in, and that there are two sides to the salad bar itself- made things move quite quickly.
Or at least that was the intention. There seemed to be some sort of issue with the cashier on our side disappearing, and an employee stocking silverware had to hop on register at the last minute but her login was not going through- luckily, the cashier on the other side (Jarra?) came to the rescue and began attending to both sides of the buffet line and alternating transactions with her register. Way to step up!

The salad bar portion started with a few premade featured salad options, then had all the ingredients, add-ons, and dressings to fix up your own. BF and I did a little of each. You're able to customize to make your meal as healthy or unhealthy as you want- I really try to stay away from the premade versions as they general are over-dressed and have more caloric ingredients.

Once you are seated, you can then add on soup options. Tomato soup was delicious,  cream of mushroom was a super-fresh featured flavor, and the clam chowder was very flavorful. The black bean chili had surprising depth of flavor but didn't really suit me, nor did the chicken noodle chunk.

The baked potato bar, pasta options, and dessert area are very limited- which for us was a good thing, as we could not really be tempted and could focus on the healthy meals we came here for. Lots of breads though- add a stick or two to the bottom of your soup bowl, especially the garlic bread + tomato soup combo.

Service at the table was surprisingly attentive about clearing dishes, asking if there was anything we needed, and generally maintaining a productive and positive attitude throughout the dinner rush time.After a snafu from the hosty about seating....and the make up by the server - "It's your night, sit wherever the hell you want!"  All I can say about Bouchon - WOW!

The ambiance and the out of the way to get to the restaurant (even though it is in The Venetian) makes the atmosphere and the food that much more appetizing.  Definitely recommend getting a reservation as this place fills up quickly and people tend to stay.

Food - after experiencing what we ate, I have to say that probabaly almost anything you order is going to peek your taste buds and leaving you wanting more - again, why people probably linger for the atmosphere, food and drink.    They give you pistachios and some of the best bread and butter spread I have ever experienced for fine dinning - all while being able to make a mess on your table. For an appetizer we had the pork cheek - succelent little bites of meat that complimented our drink selections.  The main course consisted of the scallops - simply amaxzing!  And the special of the day - pork loin over a bed of dirty rice.  Both dished were outstanding and were a testament to the chef's knowledge of food pairings.  We ordered a half carafe of wine on the someliers (sp?) recomendation (although it was the most expensive, it was the best choice for the meals ordered and the wine likings of each person).

We knew this was going to be an expensive meal, but we couldn't leave without having a dessert to walk off afterwards - our server keyed us into what he called "little pillows" of chocolate ding-dongs or ho-ho's of goodness with coffee ice cream - holy ****.  Enough said.

In my opinion - if you want a great dining experience with great service and an uncomplicated\/complicated menu, this is the place for you.  Plus, after dinner, you get to experience that lavishness of the decor at the Venetian as you walk through the long isolated promenade hallway back out into the Vegas night!We stopped in for drinks only.  We sat outside. It was really nice and they had the misters on to help with the heat. It was a nice atmosphere. We ordered a couple of beers. I love my beer really really cold. The beer here was barely cold. I think it sat at the bar for several minutes beforw the server brought them out. Very frustrating. But the atmosphere and service was pretty good. We will try the food next time.The food is amazing... I Went there with a few friends, and I just fell in love with this place.I have had the pleasure to eat at this restaurant. While not all pizza is the same they do make an amazing Calzone and Alfredo Pasta which I had sirachi sauce added. The kids and family are always greeted at the door by the host and or owner which is a nice change from the bid scale eateries. This is a great small business and would recommend everyone to try. Remember if you don't get the same level of service that we have had, please speak up and talk with the management or owner. They deserve the opportunity make your experience enjoyable. Owe and the cheese steak Calzone with sauce on the side is number 1 for this guy.I am not really a fan of Mexican food but that is why my friends chose this place. the location, atmosphere (during a nice september night), and staff were great.  
I had the chorizo and celcine beef taco...also the leftover pulled pork and shrimp tacos from my full friends (they dont eat much). The tacos were small but the flavour was decent. like I said I am not a fan of Mexican food but this was ok. Id still prefer to go somewhere else but not for other Mexican food. Im glad I went because its a nice place and to reconfirm my preference in food.Woke up craving a chili cheese dog and lucky for me I had a willing partner to indulge on this delicious idea with me later that same evening. We showed up at Happy Dog a little after 5 and got ourselves a booth. This time around I enjoyed the atmosphere so much more because there was no band playing or crowd to fight through; I could actually talk to my date without yelling across the table! But, if we are going to be honest here there was not much talking, more so there was shoveling of hot dogs, tater tots topped with mac & cheese, and craft beers down our gullets. 

I keep messing up at this place because I want to try something different so I order this fancy concoction of a hot dog and immediately regret my choice. Thankfully my date got the chili cheese dog and offered to switch with me. So the lesson here, for me at least, is stick with what you know tastes good! No need to step outside the box and put craziness on a perfectly good all beef wiener. However I do recommend putting the mac & cheese on those tots, mmm so good. 

Our bill came to $25 for two hot dogs, two beers, and an order of tots and I have no complaints about the price. No issues with the staff either, they were all friendly and attentive. I would definitely come back.I apologize but screw the owner and this place....  0 stars would be more like it.  We were having a great time enjoying tea and desserts until a gentleman sitting in the corner told us to be quiet with a loud "SSSSHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!"  Pardon us for laughing at a friend's funny story.  I asked the employees who he was and they said he was the owner.  So again.... screw him and this place.The atmosphere is nice and the presentation is unique and refreshing. The food on the other hand is simply embarrassing. 

The Asian dishes:
Broccoli Beef was beef with broccoli stems
Unlabeled Eggplant thing - not good
Potstickers were beyond cold
Pork had no crust and was bland
Beef ribs were pretty good
Pork ribs were ridiculous 

Mexican:
Served in pots and neither attractive nor cohesive

American Comfort Food:
Inexcusable not to have white meat as an option for fried chicken
The sweet potato fries were soggy
The meat section while impressive to look at came up way short with bacon that lacked smoke, brisket that was dry and mediocre at best

Sushi:
Don't go to any buffet for sushi

Dessert:
Sorbet was good and earned a star on its own. Otherwise the taffy was rock hard and creme brûlée was simply not good. 

The seafood is the mainstay and was good. If you want to spend $45.00 for all you can eat crab legs and shrimp then mission accomplished. .Fun place, amazing drinks and excellent customer service. Kuddos to the guys at the bar. They know how to make top notch drinks!!Food was overpriced - Ten dollars for a burrito ala carte with no guacomole or sour cream. Shredded beef burrito was average quality but served luke warm.  Ordered regular margaritas - $4.99 on the menu but showed up as $6.49 on the bill.  Won't be back.This place was once a motorcycle garage and now it's a coffee joint.
They reused the old floors and made it Art Deco.
Also they have bubble Teas and a restaurant too.

Bring everyone you know to this local coffee shop and you will be happy.Such amazing food! The southwest burger was simply divine!! I think the best part about society cafe is it's chic nature, it's refreshing and quite all at once.

I was impressed by what you got for what you paid, I'm a very big stickler for quality so it nice to see encore keeping true to the Wynn name! 

We didn't have any of the cocktails but they all sounded soo good, I'd totally come back for breakfast!This place has great Ramen! I went here never having Ramen before I love it!
I order it with ground chicken and ordered it level 2 and it was really spicy and seasoned just right! I will be definitely be trying more ramen places in the future!Pizza here is LEGIT.
I ordered a Royal Pizza it's super good the crust is perfectly done and the sauce is so tasty. Yes for this Pizza RestaurantI had a tasty, healthy lunch here! I had a tuna melt sandwich with the red cabbage slaw, and my friend had the beetnik with potato salad. I was looking for something hearty and found that the tuna melt definitely satisfied my craving. The tuna tasted pretty fresh, and the sandwich had just the right amount of cheese. The red cabbage slaw was fresh and crunchy.

The environment is cozy, warm, and well-decorated. It was pretty busy during lunchtime.

Her beetnik looked delicious, and I was trying to go back on a Saturdday to try it out... but then I forgot that it was brunch on weekends during lunchtime! Foiled.Toujours très curieuse, j'ai apprécié mon expérience au foodlab. L'entrée était succulente, le plat aussi, mais adorant les épices, je crois que j'aurais dû sélectionner quelque chose de plus relever. Je dois avouer que les bettraves avaient un petit goût amère que j'ai trouvé particulier.We are there at peak time for Sunday breakfast.   The service was very fast.   The waitress was super.   I wanted something off the menu.   She made it happen.  

Our food was great.   It was served quickly and very hot.   My off the menu item was perfect.   All in all a great experience.YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(315\/365) "Brick And Mortar"

Open for just over two weeks now,  Tacos El Buen Pastor has finally opened their restaurant location right across Cardenas on Meadows and Decatur! 

Not only can you feast on the best al pastor tacos in town IMO,  but they have expanded their menu to also include other specialties from Jalisco,  Mexico like Tortas Ahogadas and for those of you who remember Birrieria Jalisco back in the day (where Cornish Pasty now stands) Their Birria de Chivo ( Goat ) Estillo Jalisco is very hearty, delicious and generous in portion size (two sizes, $9 and $15) and comes with freshly made corn tortillas. Perfect for this cold weather!  I've never had a Torta Ahogada before ($6.50) so we got one done classically with Carnitas
(However,  you may choose among their other meat selections, and the bread is said to also come from Mexico) this was also pretty huge, hearty, and good.

One of the great things about TEBP is their ordering system: you walk in and peruse the menu...When you know what you want, place your order with the person behind the counter,  pay,  and go find a seat. The cooks call your name when your order is up, and your food is nice and hot. No having to go to a certain line for a certain item, and when you're finally done paying,  your food is cold like those other places **cough El Gordo, Taco Y Taco cough** 

Very comfy seating and spacious inside, with fresh agua frescas that change every so often (there was Horchata and Guayaba) and a full salsa bar to customize your order as you wish. Come check them out!  ALOHA!!!


Shaka Meter: \uuu\/  \uuu\/  \uuu\/  \uuu\/  \uuu\/  5Great service. This place is a hidden gem. Food is delicious. They have a lot of choices. Breakfast, lunch and dinner all day. They have a nice patio  and nice breeze. Breakfast burritos, sandwiches and breakfast plates are very tasty. Pancakes are huge.I ordered my pizza from this location. They told me 30 to 40 minutes even though I'm a mile away. So I waited past the hour and called back to see what happened to my order they got mad and said I'll get soon and hung up on me. They got bad customer service and not timely."Bonjour, mon ami.  Lardons, si vous plait"

Located conveniently by the hotel elevators at the Paris Las Vegas hotel, Le Cafe Ile St. Louis offers French American cuisine, specializing in breakfast\/brunch.  A cute facade makes diners feel they are in city of lights, with dining inside or "al fresco", which in this case means overlooking the casino floor.  I chose to sit "al fresco" both times I dined here, as it gave ample opportunity to people watch, both those gambling & those walking by, and to enjoy the filtered casino air.  I assumed seating inside would be rather stuffy.

As previously mentioned, I dined at Le Cafe Ile St. Louis on two occasions, for dinner then for breakfast the next day.  Here's the 411-

Dinner - There was very little wait & was quickly led to a table.  While waiting for my order to arrive, crusty bread & butter were placed on our table-
http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/le-cafe-ile-saint-louis-las-vegas?select=nag8tyKxp8-Wzocr7jGkBQ#nag8tyKxp8-Wzocr7jGkBQ
By crusty, I mean crusty.  The outer layer of bread was as crusty as my tidy whities after my first wet dream.  Yes, that crusty!  Inside, though, was airy & soft.  The butter was crack to me.  I asked for another helping of it, as I was liberally dousing each piece of bread w\/ butter.  I even helped myself to spoonfuls applied directly to mouth, w\/o the interference of bread.

Calamari - Fried squid w\/ crispy onions, fennel, lemon & a dijon mustard vinaigrette $12-
http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/le-cafe-ile-saint-louis-las-vegas?select=nag8tyKxp8-Wzocr7jGkBQ#kVwRy-qO3v8PJYyLn5u9aw
This was delicious.  Generous portions, fried crisp & light with a captivating vinaigrette.  I asked for more of said vinaigrette because I was bathing each piece of calamari and\/or onion with it.  

Burger and foie gras - Angus beef, pate de foie gras, caramelized apples, balsamic gastrique on a brioche bun w\/ pomme frites $18-
http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/le-cafe-ile-saint-louis-las-vegas?select=nag8tyKxp8-Wzocr7jGkBQ#MeXfEou-G1FANcmYRGUT5w
Tres bien!  What sold it for me was the foie gras, a food item that was recently banned for sale in California.  It's like meat butter.  I delighted in the medium-rare goodness-
http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/le-cafe-ile-saint-louis-las-vegas?select=nag8tyKxp8-Wzocr7jGkBQ#b40GDQLSlIUeiYa7GWeWQw
The pomme frites (french fries) were, sadly, soggy & limp.  I guess they spent too much time w\/ the Paris go-go dancer the previous night ;p She sure knew how to twerk it, so I don't blame the fries for being limp LOL

Creme brulee $8 - 
http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/le-cafe-ile-saint-louis-las-vegas?select=nag8tyKxp8-Wzocr7jGkBQ#I2QqmkDyFQxm4iGwkx9Y_A
Ahhh, the crispy sugar shell forming a roof over the thick creme underneath.  This was magnifique!  I savored each & every bite, delighting in the burnt flavoring of the sugary shell.

Breakfast - There was about a 5 min wait, so it wasn't long before being seated "al fresco".  Complimentary toasted bread of choice was provided.  I chose sourdough & extra of that fantastic butter.  

Corned beef hash w\/ two poached eggs $15 -
http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/le-cafe-ile-saint-louis-las-vegas?select=nag8tyKxp8-Wzocr7jGkBQ#Lbn2VWRXcYHOWnJDlIpQ2A
Hearty, rich, stick to your ribs good!  I relished each & every bite, as the runny egg yolks slithered down the hash, making for a delectable meal.  Quality portions, worth the $15.

Cafe latte $5 - This could French kiss my derriere.  Weak coffee in a small cup.  I thought the Europeans were known for how strong they like their coffee.  This was more like Folgers.  The Gevalia I brew at home is leaps & bounds better than this drivel.

Service was good, as extra butter was brought out & drinks were refilled.  Seating is plentiful throughout, w\/ my recommendation of dining "al fresco".

I enjoyed my 2 dining experiences here at Le Cafe Ile St. Louis.  It's Vegas, so the prices can be a little high for what you get, but I mostly enjoyed the food I had the pleasure of eating here.  Plus, the convenience of having the restaurant located right outside the hotel elevators make stopping here a breeze.

Recommend!

Au revoir!

NOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOMCheap booze, friendly bartenders, great food.  Not a bad place to spend time, and after a couple visits you honestly feel like part of one big Moose family.Worst experience. EVER. 

We were blatantly ignored for the first 10 minutes while we stood awkwardly in the middle of the restaurant's floor. When I asked the server behind the bar if we should seat ourselves her response was, "I would prefer if you didn't." Following which she continued to ignore us. A group of three patrons asked what we were doing because we were hovering around their table making their meal uncomfortable, at which point the same server who I had spoken to came over to deliver some food to them, ignored us again and then went on to clear a table (of the wrong size for our group) rather than acknowledging us. 

There were 2 open tables at the back, which would have been large enough to accommodate our group of 3 - so having been repeatedly ignored and told not to seat ourselves we left. 

I will be sharing this horrific experience with all of my friends to ensure none of them eat there. Stay posted for the review of the restaurant we wound up at, which acknowledged us.You can never go wrong with sushi burrito! Soho is the best in town. The staff is great.A huge boon to North Olmsted! Middle eastern market with lots of the frozen items you are looking for, some fresh veg, genuinely fresh pita - soft and pliable, and really well made takeout items, and a variety of beverages and pickles.  

The deli chef is an excellent cook. What we tried from the deli over the course of four visits: 
Lebnah - a soft cheese with spicing. Spicy (if you're not used to spice). Excellent.
Hummus - made with quality Lebanese tahini. A little different than I make it, but quite good. 
Baba Ganoush - creamy garlic and eggplant
Tabbouli\/taruli - made right.  A parsley salad with a smattering of bulgur, seasoned just right.
Breaded cauliflower - very nice. Deep fried, flavored breading
Spinach pie - thumbs up from the other eaters. I didn't have one.
Meat pies - two varieties tried. Both well made, one with more cumin than the other.
Fresh very large flat bread - sort of afghani style, my knowledge is limited here. Fresh and pliable. 
Kusa - a garlicky squash dip. Yum.
Fried zucchini in tahini. Yes.
Manakish zatar, manakish cheese and zatar. Small flatbreads with cheese and\/or zatar, an herb blend. Delightful.

Various desserts, including nougat with apricot, and several fried and sugared desserts, names unknown to me. All good quality.Al Pastor is the best. Had a late night taco session requiring immediate action. My neighbor from TJ said, these are the shiznit, and he was RIGHT! Not fatty, real rotisserie style meat, guacamole sauce, cebollitas y jalapeno on the grill. A+++ The only train they don't get 5 on it is because their set up sucks, and it takes like 45 min standing in line, and you stand in different lines for different meat. stand in line for specific meat, then go pay and get your cup, and finish off with your beverage. I also had the fries with asada...good fries, but the asada was like a B. All that being said, this will be added to my Vegas eatery rotation every time i visit. 4 tacos de alpastor con todo porfa....The service was good, the decor was nice,  the food presentation was well done.  The food was good, but when I see prices in this range, I am expecting great.  I'm not saying the food is bad, but the quality of the food does not match the cost.  If the prices were lower, I would probably give this place 4 stars, but I know there are better restaurants in Madison at this price point.Two weeks ago on a Saturday night a couple friends and myself decided to go back to 806 for a couple martinis. Which proceeded to turn into a martini taste test! We tried 9 different drinks and although some tastes aren't for everyone...let's just say we drank till the last drop. The bartenders that night were busy yet attentive. And honestly if one of us decided we weren't happy-they would have fixed it I'm sure. 

I think the interior is quite charming. The front bar is cozy as are the rooms upstairs. Sure I am obsessed with the animal print sofas. But they make for great areas to sit with a group of friends or on the zebra sofa on a date. During the summer there is a great side patio to enjoy also! Each time I have been there I have been greeted at some point by the owner-who is ever present and super friendly and always makes you feel at home with her smile:)

Need a good Martini???Sadly I am giving the Gilbert location an average rating not because the food or service was poor, but rather the layout and seating of the building was designed poorly for anyone who has a need for Accessible (ADA) seating.  Went last night and the food and service were great but unfortunately since I have a special needs daughter who needs to be in her special stroller we were limited to 1, that's right 1 low-top table in the indoor section or 4 couch style seating arrangements on the patio.  Thankful the patio was decent for middle of July in AZ but that is more the exception rather than the norm.  The food is great but poorly designed for anyone with special needs.  I really can't understand why all the seating had to be built on top of platforms, hell they built the building from the ground up.  Hopefully the management will make some changes to be more accommodating to others.It's Chili's you know what you are signing up for. I've never had a problem with service here and the food is always adequate, I enjoy the potato soup.  Turn up.Nothing like the original location on Dundas St. Food is prepared and taste very different. Will go back to the original location.One of my Favorite Late night places! LOVE the Live music ..soothes my soul with artistic talent every time. Art is creative & funky ,dim light & good food. Bar always steady stream of customers.
Service girls are just ok ,not very verbal ;however, may be language barrier. Either way I am a devoted fan.Location and decor is great. Service is prompt and well-mannered. The food is where Pickle Barrel fell short; avoid the Paella, it seems microwaved or seriously pre-cooked like a lot of the food here. The rice was stiff and cold and the meats were not much to speak of. I have been for breakfast and it was much better. Overall a good restaurant but food can be bland.To start I was a bit hesitant because the location of the place, once we went in all of that went away. I am from NYC and lived in Japan for about 6 years, I know what great sushi is supposed to be and this is it!! The staff was also great even had a special dish made for me and my lady. I will continue to go to this place even though I live 30 minutes away. You should go too. It's worth it.We wandered in while waiting for an oil change down the street. 10am on a drizzly Saturday meant they were cleared out of a lot of donuts, not surprising. We each got a donut and coffee and sat down to eat. Coffee is pretty good here. The teenage girl behind the counter told us she couldn't run the espresso machine, but oh well. My buttermilk donut was pretty yummy. Not sure I would ever come back, but it was good for an impromptu visit.This is the first time I've written a review because this place is so delicious! My boyfriend and I have tried so many different sushi places and finally came across this one. The sushi was so fresh  and the happy hour prices were great.  It's a very small place but the staff was very friendly and attentive the whole time. Defiantly give this place a try but not on Sunday's.I went here for Father's day and I was really impressed! I wasn't sure what to expect since I normally don't dine in that area. I ended up getting a seafood dish and it was awesome. I had no idea they fly in fresh fish for that day! Normally, seafood in Arizona scares me, since we are so far away from the ocean. However, it tasted really fresh. I would definitely come back here for date night or a special occasion.Always up to try a new coffee place!  This place is located on Main St off Charleston in the Arts district area.   I had the Mexican spiced latte as wanted to try something different than a regular cup of coffee, and wow it was awesome!  Very nice flavor and spice.  Also was greeted as I entered and the overall service was good.  The only slight knock is their prices are on the high side but if you like good coffee, trendy environments and supporting  local businesses it is worth trying!This place only gets one star for our server who was the only redeeming factor of this establishment.  The bad attitude started via phone from who I am going to assume is the manager.  A coworker of mine made a phone call to give a heads up that a possible group of 30 people were coming in at 4:30 for happy hour and she just wanted to make sure this was alright.  The manager (tall, skinny blonde chick) said to her on the phone in an annoyed voice that Thursday's are their busiest happy hours and they start filling up at 3:30.  She went on to state that we should've called the events coordinator because they handle large groups.  We weren't aware we had to call an events coordinator just for a happy hour get together.  Furthermore, I'm pretty sure a large group of people have randomly shown up for drinks without calling the events coordinator and I'm sure all was fine in The Vig world with no hiccups or bumps.

Two people from our group showed up a little bit before 4:30 on a Thursday (01\/21\/2016) and  they were informed that they had a table set up for us on the patio that could accommodate our group.  Miss Sunshine (the manager) came over to sternly go over the check policy and made it very clear that they could not split checks because it would crash their server.  Umm ok, if splitting checks makes your server crash then it's time to upgrade to a new server.  On top of that the place was dead.  There was one table inside and two (not including our group) on the patio so I'm not sure where this 3:30 rush of people were but they certainly weren't at The Vig.    

I showed up shortly after they did and decided to go to the bar to grab a beer along with a coworker.  Miss Sunshine was by the bar when she rudely stopped me to ask, "Are you with the big party on the patio?" I replied "yes" and she put on her best Mean Girl voice and said, "You have a server out there."  I let her know that I was just grabbing one drink and cashing out.  As my coworker was looking over the menu she (my coworker) asked if I planned on ordering food, I told her that I wasn't.  Miss Sunshine chimed in, "Umm, just so you know if you want to order food you need to order it from your server" which that statement was accompanied by an eye roll.  At this point I had had it with her attitude and decided to give a little bit back to her and reiterated to her that I wasn't ordering food, but thanks for the friendly reminder.  I paid for my drink and rejoined my group.

I was facing the bar from my seat on the patio and during my stay I watched the manager check on every single table on the patio but ours.  Any time she was near our table she would roll her eyes and scoff but she was chummy with the other tables.  Her body language, her tone, her facial expressions made it very clear that she was annoyed by us (not sure why) and that she looked down on us.  It wasn't just me who got that impression because more than one person in our group picked up on it.

I think it's safe to say that a great deal of us have all worked in the food industry in one way or another, but I have never treated anyone the way she treated us.  When I was a server I never made any of my customers feel like they were a burden to me or that I thought less of them.  Because of her sparkling personality I will never return to this Vig but the others will have my business.  The other Vig's know how to treat their customers, they know how to make them feel welcomed and they never seemed bothered by a group of people wanting to spend money in their establishment.

This was my first and last time at this location, which is sad because it's so close to my work.  So thank you little Miss Sunshine for reminding me that kindness goes a long way.  Next time check your Mean Girl attitude at the door and slap on a smile even if you don't feel like it.  You know the old saying, "fake it til you make it!"Dilly's Deli is a simple, fast causal sandwich shop that serves up Boar's Head brand meat, soup & salad.  The place is really bare bone basic , you order at the counter and you pick up at the other end when your name is called.  Yes, it's on the pricey end of my scale mainly b\/c you are getting Boar's Head meat & cheese (this stuff is not cheap even @ the market) but you can still make thing work if you know how. 

My favorite here are:

Dilly Bird (4.5*)  Loaded with turkey slices, cream cheese, avocado, sprouts, mayo...all toasted together...so good!
http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/y3bMutme81x4PUhb0zaC_A?select=WdSiXnBBZDrJmMNxlYvMeg

Creamy Chicken Noodle (4*) - super rich & creamy ck soup loaded with ck,  noodle, carrots & celery (comes w\/ homemade bread bowl)
http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/y3bMutme81x4PUhb0zaC_A?select=uvqcsvqfQ_AJCl9kFLjPLQ

Caesar salad (4*)

Tips on saving some $$ - 

1) Go with the Daily Special - $4.79 for any 1\/2 sandwich & a side

2)  there's always a coupon insides the "San Tan News" located by the entrance  (20% off)

3) come on the weekends when kids meals are FREE (with another paid entree, the $4.79 special works too).  Chicken soup is even on the kids meal menu!!!

4) don't forget your punch card


Cons - 
- Tap water taste awful, skip that if you can
- Sandwich looks dinky on the huge basket it comes on


Food - 4*
Ambiance - 3*
Service - 3*Let me give you a clue.... upon walking in, many staff were on break, outside, on the regular patio, smoking cigarettes.

I walked in to get a table for six. This was around 10pm ... well after dining hours. It took the hostess several minutes to even walk over to great us. Immediately she told me that we probably would not be able to get a table and shrugged... as if she could literally care less. Looking at the seating chart I immediately saw 4 tables unseated. I looked around and saw where they were. So I inquired about the seating. She told me that they were 4 tops and probably couldn't find any chairs to make tables. Yadda yadda. She just did not care about us at all.

A second hostess came up and I expressed my concern about not feeling welcome and I explained how we had wanted a table. 

Long story short, this was my first time here and my first impression with the hosts was awful. WHY I HAD 5O WORK SO HARD TO GIVE THEM BUSINESS IS BEYOND ME.

I ended up expressing my feelings towards the manager but by that point we had made a decision to go across the street to TGIF. 

We had wanted to celebrate a family moment and the service here was anything but welcoming.

I highly discourage you from attending this place. It's horrible. One of the worst places I've ever been to and by far the worst Yelp review I've had to write in a long time.Just consumed the nice prime rib dinner with delicious mashed potatoes and brown gravy tha must have had crack cocain or something illegal in it because it was SO tasty ....au jus was great...dunk your dinner roll with butter into mashed potato gravy and then into au jus juice....wow! String beans were fine...so was salad...ordered steak medium rare...came out a perfect juicey medium..nice! Rolls were nice...service was good... I really think for the money this is the best prime rib deal in town...not a fancy place but quiet and clean and good service...I will be back...hahaha , ....actually tomorrow to split the big Reuben sandwich and fries with a friend for lunch...o yeah ..on Friday they have a really nice clam chowder soup with lots of clams...good stuff ...when asked for soup or salad and you are offered clam chowder or salad, get the clam chowder...Nice!5 Star food at One $ prices. Easily the best quality for your dollar in the city!


The staff was super nice to the point that if the food was average I would give it four stars. When I saw the prices I thought maybe I was confused or something was wrong. I ordered 6 ribs, mac & cheese and candied yams for $14. The ribs and the sides were amazing and nothing I write could do them justice.

(the following is included to shorten the line)
Showcase is in Homewood in a building that from outside looks condemned with all the boarded up window glory. If it weren't for the whiteboard outside that said "Open Today" I wouldn't have gone in. 

They only have like 3 small tables and all the food is served up in styrofoam containers so this is clearly a place where the food is meant to be taken out.This tiny coffee shop is a great option for vegan treats and excellent beverages. FYI - they are cash only but do have an ATM. I have three vegan youngsters in my life who love the cookies, and a non vegan husband who got a kick out of the dinosaur cookie I bought him. They have WiFi and a comfortable atmosphere. It's an enjoyable alternative to Starbucks, and you can't go wrong buying local.Dropped in for a taro bubble tea. The service was quick and the tapioca was pretty good, the tea itself however didn't have strong flavours and there we bits of taro in my drink which Really annoyed me.Love this place food is on point especially the pot roast sandwich!! Love the live music we went late after LIB and William from the Voice was singing!! Where does that happen?!? You gotta check it outI been there few times in the last few weeks,
I can say that this place is different , the food is very good , and better is the chocolate and the cookies.
The service is little bit slow , but I guess it is expected at a newly open place5+ stars!

The Container Park was such an awesome place to visit and quite honestly, one the highlights of my trip to Las Vegas. 

The area was still relatively new and we found it really quiet on an early Thursday afternoon. So we took advantage of the ample lawn space and practiced our handstands and cartwheels, hung off the ladders of the caboose, visited the barber, ate some jerky, lazed on the swinging bench, and watched some kids tag the brick wall with some chalk. All while the sun loomed high with nary a cloud in the sky.

The centerpiece was a tempting treehouse that was off limits because the scorching heat had turned it into a huge vertical frying pan. We entertained ourselves with the NEOS play system where we tuckered ourselves out with light-tagging challenges that sent us in cardio circles. Running under unrelenting heat rays sent us panting to the shade where we constructed a giant-sized Jenga set with the foam blocks. A nearby curious child joined our game and with his father's help, he managed a few key plays.   Another friend fashioned herself a couch complete with a drink kozzie and sat back chanting, "Jenga...Jenga...Jenga..."  What goes up must come down and down the tower tumbled at eight levels high, raining cushy blue rectangles to a chorus of mirth and merriment.

Intrigued by tales of the past-9 PM wonder hour, I will surely return the next time I am in the hood.I would rate my overall experience as 3.5! They have a medium sized outdoor area and we were seated quickly! The service was just okay.. There were sweet servers and there were others that seemed to rush everything and that's the main reason I gave it a 3.5. 

I ordered Tiramisu ice cream which was DELICIOUS! The ice cream it self deserves a 5 star! It was served with biscuits soaked in espresso and topped with whipped cream and coco powder! It is a must! 

It's average priced; we got a beer, cider and shared the Ice cream, the total price was about $25.Amazing burger...love the crab po boy as well (real crab and a lot of it). The turkey club sandwich is good too. Wash it down with a bloody beer if you want to try something new. They smoke their own pork too if you are looking for a unique twist on a benedict. They recently opened a new restaurant call the Stove on S Eastern also. I havent tried it yet but intent to.Was looking on Yelp for a sushi restaurant in my not usual neighborhood & saw a friend gave this a 5 star so I had to try it.  She was right!!  Worth more than a 5 star!!  Sushi selection was SO good, service was excellent!!  Casual, relaxed atmosphere.  She didn't say, but I'm pretty sure it was the owner who came out to check on us.  Very kind & welcoming.  Spicy edamame is the best in town according to the boyfriend... and he's an expert!  Can't wait to go back!!Best steak restaurant in the city! Hard to locate but that's what Google search is for. The restaurant is in a little small house. The ambiance is classic and intimate.The Caesar salad is made right in front of you with fresh ingredients and the cheesy bread is to die for. Pricey but worth every penny.A ripoff.  You are paying to eat at the Bellagio.  The food isn't worth the price and after paying $50 plus gratuity I would have thought that I wouldn't come away thinking that the best things I had were  the pretzel roll and coffee.  And I wouldn't have thought that ordering espresso would incur add'l cost.  The buffets at M and Paris are far better or if you leave the Strip, the Stations are a far better value.Wowzas, I'm impressed!

Like many other reviewers, I am not a fan of buffets, but when my family decided to meet up here for my Uncle's farewell departure, I sucked it up and tried out Jasmine Tokyo. 

First of all, I love the fact that they kept the layout, with the tables, booths, and bar area the same. Second of all, they have sushi that is constantly being visabily made and set out! Win! Some of the rolls include: rainbow roll, caterpillar roll, fried jalapeño roll, a boring California roll, two other deep fried delicious looking rolls, and a few other maki rolls. They also have sashimi (tuna, shrimp, yellowtail, squid)! Aside from sushi, they have a Mongolian stir fry station, prime rib, Crab legs, salads, and tons of deserts, including gelato! 

I would definetly come back!I hate to be the one but, barkeep, not the best, unfortunately it's always the bad ones that make it. Food 1 out of 10, I got the wings and fries and my wings tasted like they tried running away from the deep fryer but failed. My fries were soggy, just imagine cereal after 20 minutes. Best of all the barkeep didn't know his taps and gave me a lager when I asked for stone ipa. Honestly I don't know what happened to this place, but you get what you pay for I guess now.They've got one of the best burgers I've ever tried. Went there 15m before they close but they stay opened until 9:15-9:30 for us to finish our food. The owner was super nice. Make sure to try their burger and special fries.Truly disappointed.  The service was horrible and when I pointed it out I got excuses about the kitchen.  Don't make excuses, take responsibility for the poor service.  There was staff standing around talking to each other instead of serving customers.  The food was just okay, not super great.  We won't be going back.  I wouldn't recommend this place, there is way better sushi restaurants in the area with better food and superior service. Never going back.I call this place "Pizza Subway" because the pizzas are assembled like a sandwich at subway -- fast and with whatever ingredients you picked. They have gluten-free crusts for an extra cost. I got the Mr. White pizza on gluten-free crust and added jalapeño and olives (an extra $1 for toppings). It took longer to cook than 2 minutes, mostly because the gluten-free crust is frozen. Overall taste was fine for the price of the pizza.We are here for our anniversary.  We drove in from Chicago and were not disappointed.  

We started with the deviled eggs - a very unique not what you expect experience.  

My wife got the pork schnitzel and it was great.   I got a steak and it was above average but in hindsight I would have gotten something else.  

For dessert we got the pecan profiteroles and they were WONDERFUL !  They have a maple ice cream in the middle instead of some whipped filling like I have had other times and it was great.  

There were plenty of wait staff so we felt very taken care of.  

It was a great night.Tried to call ahead to set up a reservation and could not get through. Once I got there the hostesses told me that "3 people were working the phones today taking reservations" yet no one answered. I was turned away and told that I couldn't sit at the bar and be served food. I would not recommend this place to anyone. I was only coming here to use a groupon.Yay for boba tea because they have it here now and that makes me happy! China A Go Go is always a great go to place for lunch or dinner. It's way better than Panda Express and they have great lunch specials too! My family loves the Orange Chicken here because it isn't dry and over done like at Panda. I am a fan of the fried rice and veggies myself. Of course you can never go wrong with the chips that they give you here while you are waiting, they are super addicting and they are great to dip in anything! 
They are always super friendly here too, which is always a plus because you can't just have yummy food if you don't have nice friendly people to go with it :-)Middle of the road  average lunch experience. Typical of Ahwatukee'a sea of chain restaurants. This concept is tired the food is bland, and the vibe is too. You can do worse in Tukee, go across the street and try red lobster!I really want to like this place. It is only a 10 minute walk from my house, and it is very convenient for me. I have eaten her several times, and have had a few things off of the menu. I highly recommend the brizzas, breakfast pizzas. They are delicious and they are always good. The other items that I have tried have been hit or miss. 

The Gouda brizza is made with smoked gouda and apple smoked bacon. What can be wrong with that combo? Absolutely nothing! I have also had The Toluca. It has chorizo, peppers, cheese, and jalapeno cream cheese. This brizza is so good, but very rich. 

I have also had the three cheese omelet. The first time I had it the omelet, it was brown, dry, and inedible. I sent it back and the replacement was excellent. The truth is the rosemary potatoes were the best thing about the meal. 

This morning I work up with a craving for pancakes. So, I ordered the multigrain pancakes. When they arrived they looked great. However, when I took my first bite I was so disappointed. I went back and looked at the menu, and there was no mention that these were cinnamon pancakes. There was so much cinnamon in these pancakes that they were nearly inedible. Imagine chewing 2 sticks of Big Red chewning gum and taking a bite of pancake. That is what it tasted like. The cinnamon taste actually took my breath away. I couldn't finish them. They left a horrible after taste in my mouth. I love cinnamon, but just not in my pancakes. If I had known that these were cinnamon pancakes, I wouldn't have ordered them. 

I am sure that I will go back to Scramble, but I am pretty sure I will not order the pancakes again. They should really revise the menu to mention that these are cinnamon pancakes.Let me start this review by saying that I am a dedicated and long time believer of the Buffalo Wild Wings brand. I enjoy the atmosphere, the people and the food. It's truly a great environment and one of a kind. 

I have spent quite a bit of time (and money) at this particular bdubs, if you will. Lately, my experiences haven't been the best and I feel that it needs to be put onto paper. 

Fairly recently, I have noticed that the employees seem to be of a much lower morale. They don't seem to be the typical upbeat bartenders and servers that they usually are. One visit in particular showed me why this is, it's the management. I saw a manager openly yell at an employee and embarrass them in front of customers. This is so wrong and unprofessional on so many levels. These waiters \/ waitresses and bartenders are the SOLE reason I continue to come here. I can get a blue moon and some crappy wings anywhere... But the people are what make this place such a great environment! To see the managerial staff treat these folks this way, is unacceptable. 

I will continue to come here but I will not support the managers of this establishment. It's unprofessional and deeply bothers me that they treat such wonderful, upbeat and energetic employees the way they do. 

Please keep your eyes out for this, I do not want to have a reason to stop coming to this restaurant but if that's what it takes, I will.I came here on a Tuesday night with only 2 people ahead of me, from the time I placed my order for my single chicken quesadilla it took 40 MINUTES to arrive. The couple ahead of me was already finished with their food about 15 minutes into my wait. Not only that, but a family of 6 that arrived 29 minutes into my wait got their food the exact same time as me. First and last time here. 
Edit: AND THEY FORGOT THE SOUR CREAM. WTF!Had the bulgolgi pizza and the kimche fried rice. The pizza was surprisingly good, crust was nice and Krispy and the bulgolgi was very savory. The kimche fried rice I think would have been much better with out the little korn nibblets in it. Definitely a unique dish though hands down. I accidently went over on the side where the karaoke bar was and the host told me 2 hour wait. I was leaving when I saw the other entrance and tons of empty seats and realized they have a dedicated portion just for dinner patrons without karaoke. Kinda wish I had went next door and listened to the locals of the area butcher those good old American classics lolz!Decent and interesting grub, service was a bit scatterbrained.  I would definitely go back and try more food. Eclectic menu.The only reason this restaurant gets any stars at all is because of the interior decorations\/design. Really beautiful. 

Otherwise, the outdoors are horrible, dust, dirt, construction. 

The food is actually horrible, the meats were undercooked, the rice was unflavored. The food poorly reflected Turkish cuisine. And it's way over priced. 

If you thought that was bad, let's not even begin with the customer service here. Just horrible. They give zero shits about their customers and the waitress gets real sweet when it's time to pay the bill, other than that the staff is rude af the entire time and snarky. 

Will never be coming back.Pretty good pho for East York, flavourful soup, but definitely has msg. 
Only a few options for pho - chicken, rare beef and beef balls. 

We had the chicken spring rolls too and they were very tasty, just a little bit pricey, but would have them again! 

Atleast parking is free after 6 pm!Has anyone watched Restaurant Makeover show or Restaurant Impossible when Gordon Ramsey discover restaurant owners use one week old meat to DEEP Fry to "refresh" , speeding up , or cover up the stale meats? N u think this won't happen in downtown ? This happens to me today n I have to say so far his is the worst dish I have had last 10 years not only the smell of oil fry was overwhelming , also the taste  was making me gage evey time it touched my tougue! I even confronted the chef about his Frying method , guess what he did NOT deny it! 

Many many famouse celebrity chefs said: common restaurant secret is restaurant specials n discounted food r days old food going to spoil n they r trying t get rid off. So NEVER order em!!! I didn't listen n this what happened ! 

The place had THICK Fog of oil , was unbearable as we were walking in even the door was wide open! It should have been red flag that they deep fry everything u order! Imagine u have tinny kitchen n u fry everything in deep fryer n searing meat without the ventilation. I had NEVER been to a restaurant in Toronto that walking in had fog of oil n smelt like fryer. 

Sunday eve, the daily manu (printed on piece of paper) at button section were the main dishes for 50% off . When I saw the "blacken ribs " I realized it is amazing deal I couldn't miss! The food took bit longer to come which was okay . When it came the piece meat was massive ! I was so impressed ! Until the very first bite. When I open the ribs my hand touched the texture it was unexpectedly tough like HARD tough ! I figure it might happen since the outside is hard n blackened. When I reached for the first bite the SMELL of OIL was soooooo bad mixed with some odd foul flavour! ----- have u ever had piece of fried chicken n it happens to be dark meat n smelt very very very bad! Or have u ever had a chicken wing that is over fried that all the water was drained n the meat shrunk to tough n rubbery texture while the white\/pinkish meat looking transparent(OVER FRIED IN DEEP FRIER)?Mean while the texture consisted tough beef jerky smelt like the gross dark chicken meat x10 and drumsticks out of frier!   I can't exactly describe the taste with words. I guess I can say "throwing up in my mouth" n my puppies dog chicken jerkies smelt Freshier than these(actually was like that). The ppl out there who don't eat pork , just imagine eating an precooked one week old chicken wing that has been re fried to make it taste fresh except way over fried it n it was piece of hard transparent rock with oil spilling out of meat and bones!!! N smelt so strong !! 

My bf didn't take the plunge to get 50% off food , he had the non special item which was burger from full price menu. He loved loved loved it. It looked very nice a juicy too. They obviously only use bad meats for the "special menu". So that also explains other ppl did have great experience with their "amazing food"! 

I force swallowed about 1 or two small bites. As I chew the rough surface of the rubbery meat . The oil just spells out n even felt more gross the more I chew it. N ever mentioned when I had was complete piece of lean meat. When u cool ribs the oil r usually burned off or fell out, outside is fat inside is juicy or tender. When my ribs SMELT exactly as my fries n u saw the transparent outter layer of meat. U know he DID NOT COOK my ribs. He put that meat in the FRIER n over fried it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I went to talk to the chef his name was Colin. I politely told him that my food was fried , the Color was see thru like piece of hard plastic or glass. N the texture was tough like dried cured meats n tasted all oil. He did not deny he fry it at all to my surprise n he actually apologized n said :" it's okay it's not your fault." There is another Person at back with long silver hair (man), not sure who cooked my ribs.

I brought the bones n some meat home to feed my puppy because beef or pork bones r very good since they don't shred n the dog wont chock on shredded bones. They would just try to chew the ends n grind their teeth nib at em. Guess what!!! I kept hearing loud cracking noise aft 5th cracking noise i rushed to stop my puppy . As I picked up the bone i realized the deep oil from deep frier penetrated the bones deep. The bones were fried inside out also not just the meat! I had to toss the bone immediately. 

MAKE SURE check out my photos to see the meats! 

So if u go to this place make sure Oder non on discounted non special menu! From previous reviews! A group of ppl all got sick from eating at this place , obviously they use old restaurant trick to get rid of stale meats. It's pretty appalling considering its Trever's sister restaurant.  

On my way home my bf offered to buy me any food I want so I can get some food in but I couldn't eat anything else aft d 2 bites. I was completely grossed out! C d  pics, the parts looked see thru r NOT fat, but deep fried lean meat infused in oil in frierOh yeah! Friends introduced us to Blueberry Hill and now it's the only place I want to do breakfast in Vegas. Off the strip, busy but they'll move the line quickly and it's worth the wait. Friendly staff, good service and great food. I had the apple pancakes and there's more than enough to share! Good coffee too, and they'll bring you milk on the side if you ask and don't want the fake creamers. They were able to seat our table of 6 plus infant with ease, and we didn't feel rushed, able to stay and talk plenty. My husband had an omelette, others had the chicken fried steak, coconut chicken and waffles and the cinnamon roll pancakes. Everything looked amazing!
It's a casual diner, so we're not talking fine dining, but it's a great late breakfast\/brunch place to hang.Service approximatif et lent quoique souriant. Gérant un peu agressif a refusé l'accès a la terrasse pour notre groupe de 8. L'onglet commandé a été servi cru et a dû être retourné pour deux convives a notre table. Un peu cher pour une prestation inégale et somme toute très moyenne.THIS is where you go for arepas.    Quality arepas, quality toppings. The pork can be a bit dry (both smoked and roasted), but just pour on some more sauce, or stuff your salad in there (each arepa comes with a small salad).  The black bean soup is a nice appetizer if you're there for dinner, and the sweet plantains are always a hit.  Lots of vegetarian and vegan options, as well as gluten-free.  The mushroom arepa is great.

Would have 5 stars if they served alcohol and if the pork was moister!Great service. Good servings\/value for money. Delicious food. Would go back. The free baba ganoush and hummus are an excellent touch! Just don't get filled up on that alone!For five dollars cheaper, I could have got a salad at pollo loco, with more chicken and all the other stuff that comes on a salad. The salad tasted fine. It was just extremely overpriced and for the "fire-grilled chicken" another dollar extra. Plus, they hardly put any chicken on it! The dressing was good. As I said in my tip, it's really noisy in here, very difficult to understand the people making the food when they ask a question. It must be popular because the place is packed. I won't come back. Pollo loco is my Mexican salad place from now on.This is a favorite of ours when we don't want to spend a lot of money but still go out and have a nice time.  The employees at Floridino's are so friendly and welcoming, you'll feel part of the family immediately.  Just as an example of how affordable this place is, the last time we were there we had a half order (6) original pizza muffins, 2 bottles of Stella cider, 1 Sun Spot draft, and one 12" pizza with sausage and mushrooms.  Total before tax and tip was $23.25.  Can't beat it.  I can see why they've been around as long as they have, and get as busy as they do.  Good food & drinks and always great service.We started coming here right after they first opened and everything was excellent(aside from the ugly, poorly painted grid ceiling). The pizza and salad were always perfect, friendly staff, fast service, everything was 5 stars hands down. The last couple times ive been there were very bad. One in particular, i ordered a margherita pizza with a lil bit of Bufala cheese. Before, they always informed me that the pizza would be a lil bit watery and im ok with that. This time the guy asked me FIVE times, "Are you sure??" To which i repeated, "Yes." And then asked me again after he was finished making the pizza... The last time i went there(and i do mean Last) it was around 12-12:30 on sat. and there were 2 customers besides my wife and I. There were 3 employees working, one was making the pizza, the next was workin the register, and the third(im assuming the manager) was taking break out on one of the tables. I counted 8 dirty tables, and they remained dirty the whole 30 mins we were there along with the manager on his phone at one of the tables. I ordered the same pizza but this time they loaded it down with fresh mozz and bufala(i didnt see him put the cheese on cause i went to the restroom right after i ordered an my wife started ordering). The pizza came out completely soggy and runny and i could only eat a couple bites. My salad had hardly any caesar dressing and was warm. I told my wife that i wouldnt be back but she said her pizza was fine and she would probably come back. She went back a few days later(while i was at work) an came home dissapointed. Same thing.. dirty tables, manager taking break at a table, bad pizza, dry warm salad, ect... Needless to say, we wont be back. I doubt they'll stay in business if they keep havin saturdays with 3 customers at lunch hour. Step up your game guys!I have been a lifelong fan of wings and am always on the search to find the best.  I have tried some of the best around North America, but had never tried Duff's.  I have been told time and time again that Duff's in Buffalo and Toronto have the best wings out there.  So on a recent trip to Toronto, my wife and I stopped into the Duff's location on Bayview.  These are now the wings by which I will measure all others.  Yup, they lived up to the hype and now sit at #1 on my list of "best wings"!  We popped in mid-day on a Monday and found the place to not be crowded at all.  This place is downtown, so you either have to park on the street at a meter or find a local parking garage.  We found a number of metered spots available on the street right in front of the restaurant.  Upon entering the small restaurant we saw that you could sit either inside or outside.  We opted for an indoor table since it was looking like it was about to rain outside and ordered their #4 combo.  The #4 gets you 20 wings, with fries and a large pitcher of beer for around $35.  You can split the sauce on the wing order, so we got 10 Hot and 10 Super Hot.  We ate the Hot first and those wings were amazing.  The sauce was the best I have ever tasted.  Perfect amount of heat and great flavor.  The Super Hot wings were very good as well with a noticeable jump on the heat scale, but not too hot.  Enough to make you sweat, but not to the point where your tongue is burning.  We preferred the Hot over the Super Hot due to the great flavor that came through in the Hot wings.  The fries were also very good that came with the meal.  We actually contemplated ordering another order of the hot wings since they were so good, but declined since we were already pretty full.  Duff's gets five stars for serving up what I would consider "the best wings I have ever had"!I came for lunch on a Friday. They offer lunch specials which is nice. My friend and I both ordered a burger. When my plate came it had a long blond hair in it. The waitress took my plate back right away but then it took forever to have my plate back. My friend had finished his lunch and we were late to go back to work\/conference when I finally got my burger which was very dry. Ambiance is alright. Not a fan of all those tall tables and food is totally better at my local burger place which is 3 times cheaper.Loved it!! We had a huge group.  Started outside then decided to take the huge booth inside.  Staff was so accommodating and we had the best waitress, wish I got her name.  The food was fabulous! Will defiantly go again!Great food and  great service everytime! 

You have to try the Seoul Poutine ... so good.What can I say, bad food and poor services does not make up for the unique experience of "dining in the dark." 

The "experience"...it was interesting to try and remember where you left things like your water glass and silverware.  Our guide\/waiter, Tim, was often difficult to find and other staff members frequently went to retrieve him.

The food...mediocre would be kind.  My companion had the filet which was delivered charred and overcooked.  Since Tim never bothered to check in after dropping of the meals, we eventually got another staff member to find Tim and replacement was requested.  When the replacement arrived it was delivered undercooked this time (medium was requested for the filet).  What was delivered was clearly medium-rare to rare the center of the meat was barely warm on the steak.   My meal, the braised lamb shank, was not much better.  The meat was cooked and seasoned well.  My problem was the rest of the plate. While the menu states that "All of the dishes are accompanied by the chef's sides" mine was accompanied by five small cubes of cauliflower which would be hard pressed to be considered as anything more than a garnish.   Desserts were mixed.  One was ok, but the "crème brulée du Chef" was on the runny and covered in an overly thick layer of the melted sugar--and honestly it was not very good and I love crème brulée.

All in all I would not recommend dining here.Honestly the best AYCE restaurant Around ! Awesome service , though there was an almost 30 minute wait . It was worth it ! They should look into expanding the restaurant seemed kind of small. Menu had several choices, sushi was the best .I'm not sure if I'm jaded from the lack of truly delicious thai food after trying out so many different places only to be let down.

Yupha Thai did not start out good for me as the soup and salad they provided for lunch was bland and tasteless (like soy sauce mixed with boiling water).

I ordered the Pad Thai with beef and while it did come out piping hot (a good sign), the portion size was a little lacking. My dish had more veggies than actual noodles...

If you're looking for authentic Thai food that will truly hit the spot...you're likely to have to keep searching...Hands down, BEST BUN BO HUE IN AZ. Very comparable to places in Little Saigon areas in SoCal. The broth is very authentic! I highly recommend this place.Second time here and it was 5 star PLUS rating again. The service here is impeccable. Food is top notch and wine, cocktails are amazing. This place is crazy expensive but it's worth every penny for a great dinner out for celebration or if you're really rich. Treat yo self!Not impressed at all! First off I ordered coffee and it was burnt, stale, and cold as if it was warmed up from yesterday. Then after we order our food my daughter had to use the restroom and that was absolutely disgusting I wouldn't let her touch anything in there and there was still urine in one of the toilets. So then we get our food and everything tastes like day old and reheated! The rice was dry and hard. The chow mein was also dry and hard. The only thing that was good was the egg drop soup which was kind of bland but still good and the egg roll. I would never recommend this restaurantBlue Dust features a large selection of decent beers, an appealing and clean atmosphere, pleasant service, and good food. They have a large draft list written on the blackboard which changes frequently, as well as coolers for you to mix and match your own sixpack for a reasonable price. The waiters have always been extremely friendly, and the bar has a laid-back dark cool relaxing atmosphere. PS: Non-smoking!

The fish tacos were amongst the best I've had in Pittsburgh and the China Doll appetizer was superb. They also have decent chips and salsa, a great Portabella mushroom wrap and ginger carrot soup. On my last visit I had a delicious beer called the "Duck Rabbit Milk."me and my mom were taking here for first time let me tell you this is the best mexican food you will ever ever find in vegas food is so amazing they give you a great big plate and the staff is amazing here i love this place will never go anywere else in vegas fresh real here please try it and get amazed like me mom did love you guys the best right hereI moved next to this Carls Jr in August. I've been there enough to form an opinion now. At first there was this nice guy working the window. He was funny. One time he gave my dogs a treat that was cool. But I don't think he works there anymore. One time i went through the drive through. I order 2 guacamole bacon cheeseburgers. We got 2 3 way burgers. We were starving and called, to complain. The Manager said, I could go back in a few hours for the right burgers. I did, guess what? They gave me 2 more of the wrong burgers. Then I had to drive back again, for them to give me  the right burgers. Fast forward, a week ago. I  went to Panda Express for me, and Carls Jr for my son. I had the receipt in my car, so I knew what time I got there. There was 1 car in front of  me in line. Then 4 cars got behind me. There was no backing out. I was stuck there in line for 35 minutes. Apparently the girl at the window was too fucking lazy, to tell the customer to pull up to the front of the store. Then they had the nerve to charge me full price, even though I was pissed. Apparently the cook was having a melt down, and nobody else knew how to cook. So we were all at the mercy of when the cook felt like working again.  I called the Manager and she said shes was sorry. That the girl needs to be trained to tell people to pull up to the front. That the cook was suspended for 1 week. But I got no credit nothing, just the right to vent. I told my son, I wasn't going to eat there anymore. That I would rather drive to the one on Lake Mead Pkwy instead of put up with this. But today, he wanted to eat there. I just ordered for him. Luckily nobody in front of me in line. I pull up to the window, the guy working the window has so much dirt underneath his finger nails, you would think he was a mechanic for his full time job, and this was his part time job. Did he think I was blind, and I wouldn't see it. Totally fucking disguisting.Then I told the Manager because she handed up the drink. She said it was because he was just doing a job in the back. Come on, he is probably a Gardner or something. Either way it's totally unacceptable. I'm done. I'm going to another one. This place is just way gross, totally unprofessional.Being from Italy I have to admit I love to dissect the menu and the kitchen whenever I read the words "real authentic italian".  I did not find any misspelled italian words which is a promising sign.  However, a couple of things did strike me.  The first is the type of flour used to make pizza which in Italy is usually "0" and not "00" as stated.  Then came the kitchen: a stone wheel turns inside a gas fired oven:  in my mind that already disqualifies the place from being called authentic, let alone Neapolitan.  Finally, there are hundreds or pizza associations in Italy, being associated with one is pretty meaningless.  But no big deal there. 

Let's get to the pizza.  It is a gummy one, it isn't crisp but it is somewhat thin, thus it is a Neapolitan style.  Don;t expect to find this type of pizza too much in Italy, the Neapolitan one is something you usually find only, well.. in Naples.  The taste was good, the ingredients were definitely fresh (I consider canned tomatoes fresh), the mozzarella was sliced and perfectly melted. Being cooked in a gas fire oven means no burn marks and uniformly cooked.  I like having some burnt sections on my pizzas.

Prices were not outrageous but neither cheap: $11 for a margherita pizza.  The place is interesting with the big windows and surprsingly confy chairs.  Atmosphere is very easy going.  Service was good.   So I would definitely come back here.  This is (finally!) the second place in Calgary that serves pizza that is close to Italian pizza.  The other one is Pulcinella.The food is very tasty and service is very fast. For the rice noodle dishes, the portion is generous.

I really like the place, and the only little thing is that most dishes are a bit oily to me.I would like to begin with the fact that the food did taste very good, but the one star pertains to the service.

We ordered a chipotle chicken avocado melt, an extra side of macaroni and cheese for myself, and two items for the "pick 2" meal deal for my wife.  When taking our order, the cashier (who seemed to be new) did not notify us that one of our items did not qualify for my wife's "pick 2" meal, so we were charged full price for an expensive entree when we had communicated that we specifically wanted to do the "pick 2" meal deal for her order. We did not notice this problem until we were leaving, but the bigger issue I experienced made me feel unwelcome and unable to bring a complaint to the supervisor. 

When we received our food, I brought it to the table, bit into my chipotle chicken avocado melt, and noticed it was missing avocado. I went back to the service station, and while waiting, I saw a customer complaining that they did not receive their baguette - a side dish that comes with most meals. The two people behind the counter rudely told him off, said that he was a scammer, and told him to leave. I do not know the truth of these assertions, but this was no way to speak about a patron in front of other customers. When the person left, appearing very upset about the situation, I went up with my sandwich and receipt and told them that they had forgotten my avocado. I opened the sandwich for them to show that it was missing avocado, and I asked if they could remake my sandwich. The two persons behind the counter seemed upset about the request and said that they cannot take it back, and kept talking about "customers" (as in plural - not the singular customer from before, but multiple customers now) trying to scam free things. I said I was not trying to scam them, but the person nearest the counter sarcastically said they were not talking about me and continued to discuss the issue while gesturing toward me. They then said they would not remake my sandwich but would give me half an avocado. The other person behind the counter cut half of an avocado into two pieces, diced one of the quarters, and gave me both the diced and the not-diced avocado pieces. 

I felt incredibly upset about the situation, and did not want to raise any more of a fuss in person because of being humiliated by these servers. My wife and I finished out meal (we had not eaten in several hours and were very hungry) and left. During the meal, I had looked at the receipt and noticed that we had been charged the full price for one of her entrees. 

Once we left, I called Panera Bread customer services and lodged a complaint. I explained the situation and they told me I would receive a call back in two business days about the ordeal, and I was asked if my call could be used for training purposes because of how serious these problems were. I consented to the training question, yet, I never received a call from the store. I called again today and was not satisfied with the response, which amounted to, "They are a franchise. I will send the complaint again. Have a nice day." I gave them ample opportunity to contact me to discuss the problem, and they failed to make that effort.

Update: I called the store today and spoke to a supervisor. They were very understanding of the situation. They offered to provide us two free meals or coupons, both of which I declined. They seemed to take the problem seriously and said they would address the problems with the manager who was in charge that day, as well as the associates who were on staff. My review still stands as it is an accurate reflection of how I experienced the restaurant, but I may give this establishment another chance in the future.The inside of Rooster's is fine, and the service is nice, but it's sneakily expensive and a little frustrating because of the combination of high prices and a la carte menu.. The meat portions are very, very small. Vegetable and other choices are relatively larger. I ordered the hangar steak and it was literally 6-7 bites for $18. I'd consider this more of an over-priced tapas restaurant than anything else.  Although all of the food was quite good, I won't be back as there are too many other choices providing a better experience.I'm not sure why this place got such good reviews.   I went last night with high hopes and was totally let down.   

We got 8 Asada Tacos, 1 Nachos, 1 Quesadilla.   The asada was really bland with hardly any flavor at all.   Pretty tough to mess up asada in my opinion.  There were also a lot of pure fat pieces and then partially fatty pieces in our tacos.   It's like that was done on purpose.  There was hardly any guacamole in the tacos at all.   The hot sauce was really good, so there's one pro on the tacos. 

The quesadilla was supposed to be a kids version with cheese only...   they gave us asada and lots of hot sauce on it.   Not biggie, just made our boy one at home.   

Cooks were working diligently, there was plenty of staff for a food truck (7 employees inside truck) but the order still took 20 minutes, and there was no line when I ordered.   

Another part that left a bad taste in my mouth, not literally, was a crazy guy on drugs or super drunk was asking customers that were waiting for food for money.   Some would politely say "no", or "I don't have any money".   And the crazy guy wouldn't stop asking, or he'd tell them "I know you're lying, just give me some money".   He had bugged out eyes and everyone he spoke too was very uncomfortable or scared.   You would think the staff would have asked him to leave.   Not a big deal or the restaurant's fault, just really annoying and creepy.  

All and all, this was a total fail.   I had really high hopes because the reviews.   I only gave two stars because the kitchen staff was packed in and all of them were working with a sense of urgency.Tuscany gardens chased us out at 10:25 after being seated for dinner at 9.

Wait staff was pleasant but not professional. The food was good though. 

If you've made the bad decision to stay at Tuscany casino and you're not up for venturing out, give them a try. Otherwise, there's a dozen better Italian restaurant in Vegas.Extremely disappointed. We didn't know what to order so just got a combo set ($149.99) which is for 8 ppl. We were literally disgusted by every item, except for the soup-filled wontons, and the dessert at the end. The crab was also fine, but not the starch cakes that came with it. My whole family were utterly disappointed. Perhaps we chose bad selections- but it was a dinner set and u would think the resto would put guaranteed great dishes in the set? But I would think the set, which contained about 8 dishes, would be enough of a sample size to represent the restaurant..... I feel bad for bashing the food.... but just tryna keep it real on this open platform....Don't get me wrong. I love Pamela's. But this location can't compare to the others I've been to. I'm usually not a snob when it comes to waiting for food, but waiting over 30 minutes for pancakes, when every other location has you your food in less than 10? No thanksMy husband had a customer to attend to in Phoenix, and it just worked out that my daughter and I could tag along for the weekend to enjoy the sun.  We used to live in Phoenix, and in the area of the Biltmore, so it was very special to be "home" for a few days and visit our old haunts and friends.  We have seen the Biltmore during the tough times of the recession, and so was VERY happy to see the area going strong!   Even the community around the Biltmore is thriving- new building, refurbishments, etc... it was absolutely fantastic to see.
We were in the Terrace building in a suite, so we had a separate King bedroom with a living room.  Our daughter stayed on the pull out couch and was quite happy.  We had two patios, one with a 4 seat dining table and one with four lounger chairs- perfect views of the court yard (check out my photos).  The room was beautifully upgraded in tones of Gray\/Greens that were super soothing.  The bed was out of this world comfortable (I was counting sheets so I can re-build this at home..lol);  great master bath with a soaker tub and big shower, double sinks and a makeup counter\/mirror.   We had a second  1\/2 bath that made it so nice traveling with a teenager      Katie and Cherish- personal concierge's at the hotel took AMAZING care of us.  Make sure you introduce yourself!
We were given access to the Ocatilla exec lounge as I am a Diamond Honors member and am very impressed by the offering.  We had breakfast there several times (continental), and iced tea and cold water\/snacks are available thru-out the day.  They do offer snacks in the early evening but we were SO busy, we didn't quite make it back for that;  however, we did enjoy wine\/happy hour past 8 pm each evening which we loved.  There is a separate fire pit off the patio, so you can enjoy the cool AZ nites with your wine   They brought in the most amazing desserts at this time as well- again, see my photos.
My daughter and I visited two of the pools on different days;  if you want quiet comfort- then go for the Ocatilla pool;  if you want great current music, dancing, and food\/drink services, hit up the main pool- very lively.  My daughter is 13 and she loved BOTH experiences.  You just cannot beat the Arizona sun in February.   We had a turkey wrap and drinks and arrived in about five mins time.  Great service for a busy pool day.
My husband and I did "full" breakfast at Frank and Albert's one morning;  and Adobe grill another.  We have great memories at both of these locations and simply could not resist a visit.  Frank and Albert's has been expanded it appears and the ambiance is wonderful.  Fireplaces and firepits scattered around to keep you warm, and the service was friendly and efficient.   Adobe grill holds a special place in our memories as we visited almost every Saturday when we lived in Arizona-  the menu and the restaurant has been VERY nicely redone and you cannot improve these views.  Food was wonderful- try the Big AZ Burrito with chorizo.  Fantastic.
Your evenings absolutely have to be spent outdoors around the courtyard 'somewhere'... whether that's on the Ocatilla patio, or by the main building fire pits- it's the perfect Arizona evening.  Grab a glass of wine from the bar and sit under those stars.
Also, if you want a local spot to visit (where only the locals go) check out Rokerij on 16th street and order the Chicken Chimayo-  you won't be disappointed.
I'm so sad to be leaving...  until next time...Fried Chicken; in every city, there is a place that cooks it with the idea, that it should be a great value, and it should hold up, even when packed in a "to-go" container.   This is such a place, in fact, it's only a takeout place, so don't bother planning an evening there, unless you like sitting on the sidewalk or dangling out of your car. 

I mean, the friend chicken here is good.  The drumstick is juicy, meat is tender, and the same can be said about the thigh also.  The batter coats it just right; no heavy glops of batter, when you bite in, you feel the skin giving way, to the decedent meat underneath.  The flavor is always present, the idea that it's a hug from the inside out, you get.  Sure there is a lot of great Fried Chicken places around Charlotte, but this one is the simple, working man's delight.

If you get the dinners, you also get Cole Slaw, Tater Rounds, Hush Puppies, and a nice roll. It's a perfect portion, you aren't going to be asking for me, for at least an hour, but you aren't going to be in a coma either.  Their sweet tea is the Maxwell House stuff, which is basically the base for most sweet teas, what you might expect to have been served by family or in my case, southern born friends. Yes I said it, maybe your parents served Lipton, but this tastes just about right in my mine. 

If you can get there before the rush, you might see the front of house, without trouble, but with orders made in minutes, you are assured, even if you take a few extra moments, you are still going to be rewarded with yummy food, that will make you happy, and smiling. 

Go here, lots of street parking, just off the beaten path, they close at 6pm, so beware.This is my main dinner spot when I feel lazy and don't want to cook.  Been to noodle star over 100 times now and I still love it.  Everything I ordered is good.  The congee is the best I had so far.  I like the singapore noodle, the black bean ho fan and the eggplant minced meat rice.  They also have combo dinners.  The chicken and deep fried oysters are amazing.  The fish maw soup is very tasty as well.  I def will be back soon.  Can't wait to get their congee especially when it start getting cold outside.First thing....I don't know if there is a problem with the AC, but it was very hot in the restaurant. I met a friend there, on my lunch break. Neither of us had ever been before. Learned really quick, this is not a place to visit on a hour lunch break. Arrived at 12:40, ordered at 12:50, didn't get my food until 1:20. Had to take it to go, plus it was too hot to sit and eat (even if I had more time). The atmosphere was nice. Very friendly staff, and the jazz music set a nice tone, but it was a bit loud.

I ordered sauteed shrimp with the famous lobster mac and cheese, as this was my cheat day. Well, it was a waste of a cheat. The mac and cheese was very salty with no lobster, the noodles were over cooked, and it is extremely greasy. Not much flavor. It was salty and peppery. That's all. The shrimp were a med size and steamed....typical shrimp. 

Nothing to RAVE or write home about. 

Not sure that I will visit again. 10 med shrimp and some overcooked pasta for 13.50.....clearly OVERPRICED! Oh, I also wanted hot sauce for my shrimp, but there is a .50 charge for hot sauce . Not extra hot sauce, but any hot sauce. I was shocked.Walked in, cash only place. Waitress Rose? was talking to another woman, well I waited, overheard her telling customer to call before coming, her mom sometimes don't feel good so check if I'm open. They were talking like she was a regular.  Rose was eyeing me waiting for the lady to finish, I knew she was aware of me so I didn't mind the wait.

I requested the egg rolls that was raved about here. Great! 4 large for $6.50 - CASH ONLY. Worth my money, filled me with just the eggrolls.  Cabbage, mushrooms, onions, noodles, chicken and shrimp = yum!

As Rose handed me my food, she gave me a menu telling me to call in a order if I like Chinese food. I'm sure she's aware of closing at odd times even if it says open daily 10am. 

I'd go back, its right by my house and only 4 stars because I haven't tried anything else but eggrolls.Ordered via Uber Eats... Had the carbonara, I was glad they had lunch portions. The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente. And the flavour was amazing. It got super greasy at the bottom, but how can I complain when I knew it was a mix of bacon and cheese.
Mmmm still thinking about it now...
We also ordered the margherita pizza which I heard was kinda underwhelming. I didn't try this though, I was too satisfied with the pasta.Customer service was excellent, but food was way overpriced for what you get. I had the shrimp poboy. Not that impressed.La Prima is not my typical type of coffee shop.  With it's stark interior, you won't find any deep armchairs to sink into, no jazz playing softly in the background and no trendy drink of the day.  Frankly, I like those kind of places, but if what you want is a really delicious latte, La Prima is the place for that.

Don't expect friendly baristas... In fact, they can be downright cranky at times.  Typically, service with a smile ranks high for me, but when I taste my mocha (a moka at La Prima) I really don't care if they want to scowl or smile.  They produce quality coffee and you won't stand around in line while they chat or refill a pastry case.  They'll craft a beautiful beverage fast and even their decaf espresso will beat a full caf beverage at Starbucks by a mile.

Expect to have a crash course in Italian since everything from the menu to the trash can is in Italian.  Also expect lots of older Italian men with their top 3 shirt buttons undone eating beautifully home style pasta dishes while standing around talking (in Italian of course) at the few high top tables in the shop.In a hurry that morning and was close to where we were stay and just stopped in for breakfast. 
Was okay food nothing to brag about. People working that day were friendly and did a good job.ATMOSPHERE:
It is located inside The Venetian, and it is a very busy spot. Luckily, I had made a reservation prior, because I knew this was a place that I didn't want to miss! It is beautifully decorated. The bar area is located as soon as you walk-in, and they have a comfortable and nice waitng area to order drinks before you are seated. They have light fixtures with mason jars. They have centerpieces with mason jars, but they are taken away as soon as you are seated. The napkin roll ups are adorable, and they say "Elbows off the table." 

SERVICE:
Matt was a fantastic server! Seriously... he provided really friendly and professional service. I would completely recommend him. If you can, request him.

FOOD:
Wow. The food was delicious. I ordered the Yardbird Chicken sandwich, and my husband ordered the Swine Burger. They were both sooo yummy. The chicken sandwich was so juicy, and the breading was crispy and seasoned well. It was a big piece of chicken, too! The burger was really good, but as far as looks go, my husband stated that mine looked good and wanted to try it. I wouldn't share. Hahaha. The fries were great, and the only complaint that we had was that we wanted MORE! Lol. We skipped dessert, but my husband did order a drink, which he thought was great.

OVERALL:
We ended up with check #777. Was it lucky? I guess it was. We didn't lose money on this trip, nor did we win the big bucks; we broke even. To me, that's lucky! The question is... would I visit this establishment again? And the answer is... YYEESS!!!The food, the service, oh my gawd it was THE BEST. 

I came here with my friends after Jean Georges lost my dinner reservation and thank god for this place. I got their $79 Signature Tasting Menu and it was very satisfying, not to mention filling. What I got on the tasting menu was:
First Course: Wagyu Beef Tartare
Second Course: Glazed Pork Belly
Third Course: Iberico Pork Loin
Fourth Course (Dessert): Peach Praline 

I would most definitely come back here the next time I'm in Vegas.This place was very difficult to find and the store fronts in the Grand Canal Shoppe were not helpful in finding this place. And surprisingly, neither was the security guard! 
After paying at the front desk by the Canyon Cafe and the rock climbing wall, the Women's locker room was so far away. You walk down an endless hallway with lots of different painted colored walls and turns. You literally feel lost!

The spa itself was ok. I went room by room to scope out the scene for the 3 hours I was there. Gave each room a good 30 min to chill out and try to take it all in... I excepted much more. 
- The showers had (note "had") a eucalyptus spray that infused the shower but now it's just a dangly wire with 2 green beads? Weird that the product was discontinued but that thing just hangs there with a large sign to "Try it out."
- The Aquavanna room is a small spa for 6 people, 2 of those seats were tiled lounge seats. It was a tight fit to get 6 people in there.
- The Aroma room is a semi-sauna with indian chanting and good smelly stuff steaming "herb scented air." 
- Was definitely not impressed with the Igloo - a small room (not sure if its meant for a few people or a private experience) but a cold mist\/stream of water shoots down over you... and it smells pretty...?
- The Experiential showers (i think that's what it was called?) was like the Igloo - smaller shower with Carribean storm, Tropical thunder, and some other "experience." It was cold, weird and couldn't get into it. It was like sitting under a sprinkler with club lighting and white noise.
- Long... I mean LONG.... hallways. What, again?!?!?! It took a long while to get to the co-ed areas like the Conservancy, Wave room, and the Salt room. 

I'd give this place a whirl again, IF and only IF I had a treatment scheduled. Would not recommend for the facility day use. Sorry!I'm an Arizonian (born and raised in the valley for over 20 years), and this is my favorite restaurant OF ALL TIME. Now, let me start with the best part of Los Dos: The service. It's literally always the same people. I've been coming to this location for several years now; you will not be treated like cattle here. It's like going to grandma's house and having the most amazing meal prepared for your family. Be patient and enjoy the food if it's your first time coming here, because everything comes out hot & fresh. 

Second: The Legendary Spicy Machaca Pizza (They should really update their menu to say that). This pizza is better than sex. If you *think* you like mexican or machaca pizza because you've ordered it at other restaurants, prepare for your expectations to be DEMOLISHED after ordering the Legendary Machaca Pizza, because no other restaurant will even come *close* to this.... this....... *drools*... LEGENDARY MACHACA PIZZA! 

Third: The people who complain about "it was spicier than I thought omg this was horrible there was no warning" or "omg anything on the menu that is supposed to be not spicy... like the chicken, is bland!" that's because Los Dos practically punishes you for "not ordering spicy". Even if you don't do your online research first to see what kind of restaurant this is... Even before you get seated, there is a literal sign on the front door that says SOME LIKE IT HOT!, oh, and don't mind all the decor in the restaurant (chiles, peppers, etc), and somewhere on the menu, they actually warn you that the food is spicy, and yes if you order it, you get to pay for it.

LOS DOS MOLINOS! YOU'RE THE BEST, KEEP DOING WHAT YOU'RE DOING.Riccio's is a great example of a family owned Italian restaurant. The food is consistently excellent and authentic. The staff (especially Tonya) is friendly, efficient and well trained. The hands on owner Ricky, is always around either cooking in the kitchen or checking on his customers in the front of the house. We have tried most dishes on the menu from their excellent veal to the savory seafood. Riccio's is one of our favorite go to local spots and we will continue to patronize this hidden gem!Greasy and lacked flavor. No carbonation in soda. Disappointing given the other good reviews.I would have given this location four stars, but they lost one because the green chili stew just wasn't that good, and it's usually one of my favorite things to get at a Rudy's.  Fortunately, everything else on my tray was as good as I'm used to getting chain wide.  The brisket being a particular favorite, closely followed by the pulled pork, and they apparently serve breakfast now, so I'll have to stop in for brisket breakfast tacos sometime soon.  
   At any rate, Rudy's is one of the better BBQ chains out there, and frankly they're better than many mom and pop shacks I've been to over the years. My only drawback to coming here, is that my eyes are usually bigger than my stomach, but that just means I have leftovers! Every cloud etcetera.This room is sooodope. Totally wrth the extra money for a suite. Surprisingly really enjoyed this hotel. As I said the hotel room was very nice, huge and had a great view of the strip. Also wasnt super far off the strip so def convenient etc. Will stay here againAmazing sooooo yummy come here if u love food try it u will love the meatballs sandwichI've lived my whole life within a block of Forbes & Braddock and have ALWAYS wanted to have a great restaurant like Alma nearby. I'm so glad that Jamie & Heather decided to open this gem, and highly recommend it! If you were turned of by its predecessor (Callie's), have no fear - This is a complete reboot! It has become a fast favorite for my family and my girlfriend. DO NOT MISS the ox-tail, seriously.Had high expectations for this place. Sadly, it was just OK.

Parking: It was easy finding parking (11am on a Sunday). Apart from the mall parking, you could park near the GO station.
Crowds: Got seated with no wait time. We settled for one of the middle tables because all the booths were taken. - Tables were mostly Chinese families and the ambiance was certainly HK cafe-esque. Some tables were occupied by senior citizens reading Chinese dailies. 
Decor: The decor is nice enough. High ceilings, white linen tablecloth, half-moon booths. However, how fancy can you really get within a (dying) retail mall? 
Cost: Went for dimsum and got there before 1130am so S, M, L items were all $2.30. Made the mistake of ordering two items that were XL- those came in at 4.50. (Note the xiao long bao is XL). 
Service: Was seated prompted. Food took a little bit to come out. Wait staff all assumed we spoke Cantonese. I'd say service was typical for a Chinese restaurant: efficient, albeit a bit brusque.
Food: 
Ordered 8 items: 
Good
- Shrimp Rice Roll (chao fun) 
- Siomai- Not the best we've had, but good enough
- Tofu with shrimp - Tofu was steamed - really soft and jelly-like. Taste was mild but we liked the soft tofu texture and the broth

Bad 
- Pork and duck egg congee 
- xiao long bao - expected more. Yes, it seemed to have been executed well (hot soup intact) but taste left us wanting more. Did not think this was worth 4.50 for 4 small pieces

So-so
- durian pastry - it was ok. Could have done with more durian 
- har gaw (shrimp siomai) - I thought it was tasty - wife thought otherwise
- Chives pancake - I order this every time I see it on any menu. So-so execution

What to try next time: 
- Fried fish
- Pan fried buns
- Regular (non-dimsum) menuGreat burger place. I don't eat beef so I opted for the veggie patty which was huge and delicious. The toppings they have available seemed never ending and the waiter even suggest a beer for someone like me who doesn't like beer. I would definitely eat here again. Yum!food is great and the price is even better, servers are nice and quick to bring drinks and menus to the tablet. great place to watch cleveland sporting events and hang with friends. one of my favorites to stop at and grab a burger and a brew!I'm a BIG fan! I'm almost tempted to go with five stars for this one but I'm gonna reserve that honour for the absolutely mind-blowing places I will someday encounter. 

This tiny little family run Vietnamese place is awesome. Everything I've had is good. Fast, friendly service all the time. 

Five colours rice is awesome. Steamed egg, fried egg, shrimp skewer, pork and shredded pork skin over broken rice. For someone like me who enjoys a variety of flavours in one dish this is great. The portion size is so big you could almost share it between two people. 

The vermicelli is also splendid. A perfect balance of noodles, fresh vegetables, pork, crispy springroll and shrimp if you desire with nice fresh mint and coriander. 

The various fruit shakes are fresh and tasty and they serve you complimentary hot tea while you wait. It's a nice touch.

I have had a couple of the soups and they are good too. I haven't tried the pho yet but I have heard great things.

This place is a two minute walk from my work and I am a proud regular. If only they were open on Tuesdays...Went last night.  It was pretty darn good.  They were out of Brisket but it was 7pm so It must be pretty good with so many people ordering it.  The ribs were good, not the best I have had but solid.  The sides I thought were kinda small, the fries were on the skimpy side.  I liked how the sandwiches come with Texas toast instead of a bun.  I will fo sho check this place out again,  Don't hurt its right down the hill.  I hope this place makes it (I know how most small bbq joints in this town fail).  Give it a shot.This place is whateves to me because it basically tastes like the ones you buy frozen.  My boyfriend was eager to come here so we did and he likes it. 

The reason for my three star is that it's not that bad and I think you should come here at least once for the experience. You have probably been to many fast food-chain like McDonald's, Wendy's and Jack in the box... right? So why not add this to your list?

Yes it's a little overpriced but it's on the strip and  rent is high but if this place was elsewhere it will be a lot cheaper. 

However Just enjoy it I'm sure you can try to win ten bucks at a table and try White Castle for free... HahahaYou have got to be fucking kidding me. 
There was no one in the restaurant. the place was a graveyard, yet no one thought it was important to wipe the tables or even sweep the floor. Crumbs and sticky stains everywhere. i ordered take-out before I got a good look at the place. While I waited for my order I looked around for a place to sit - no clean chairs. All had crumbs on them. Tables had folded-up pieces of cardboard shoved underneath the legs, balancing them out. One table had THREE cardboard balancers. All the chairs have chipped paint. There are stacks of sodas with a stained apron tossed onto the top of them - better wipe those bitches down good before you slurp, people!! The license on the wall reads 2008. HOLY GOD THIS IS 2010!
There is a BED that's not even hidden from view. Toothbrush and toothpaste and a shoerack! Damn, put that in the BACK ROOM not the FRONT if you so desperately need to do it. And give me a break - how busy can this place possibly get, that you need to sleep there overnight??? I shudder to think what the back kitchen looks like if they can't even pretend to make the dining area presentable. 
Even my dog wouldnt eat there... but since he's missing a leg, he might need to steer clear of this place before they try to stew him up. BTW I AM ASIAN so keep the racist accusations to yourselves, white weirdos. 
Okay, all joking aside: the place is GODDAMN DIRTY. PERIOD.The best tacos had the grilled chicken and Carne asada all seasoned to perfection definitely will be come back my wife had beef green chili quesadilla that was also really good get outside dining area for a perfect dayA few of us stopped by the other night to grab some food and watch the games. The outside seating looks a little run down but that is the only problem here if that's what you even wanna call it. They kept us warm outside and Emily was our waitress. She was amazing great personality and went above and beyond for us. I'm a sauce guy asked for a few things on the side but she brought me a few others because she thought I might like them and did I ever! My buddies got ice balls in their scotch and after seeing the prices at this place they are definitely coming back too! I was more then pleased with my service and the food, great drink prices huge TV outside why wouldn't people love this place!!!Un restaurant qui fait parti d'une chaîne belge...
Dans un décor façon BD, l'accueil est chaleureux. 
Vous y mangerez donc des frites !!! 
Servies dans un panier avec un accompagnement (bah oui, les frites, c'est le plat principal).
Large choix d'hambourgeois et de sous-marins.
Des sauces maisons (en partie de la maison du rôti). 
On y trouve aussi différentes poutines.
Pour les grands et les petits, tout le monde est ravie !

(Peut-être une terrasse, l'été, lors de festivals sur le Boulevard Saint-Laurent).Great little spot for brunch & lunch! Quick attentive service - great patio to bring a pooch!! They even give a little water dish for them. 

I had the Cali Benny. Love that they ask how I like my eggs poached. Great potatoes. Huge amount! Delicious seasoning on them too. 

Overall a great place for weekday lunch or brunch. Weekends usually mean a wait!!The thing I love about this bakery is that you can tell everything is made by hand and not mass produced. The donuts are not perfectly round and the buns can be different shapes. 

The cheese buns are wonderful and apparently world famous. The variety of other baked goods is great. They have the best fluffy scones I have bought from a bakery but make sure to get there early for the best selection. Cinnamon buns with and without raisins, glazed cinnamon twists, cookies galore etc. You can even buy a large box of their cheese buns frozen to cook at home when you want a fresh one. 

They also have a great selection of Dutch treats like sugar bread (baked only on Fridays) and house made Stroopwaffels. 

The service is also very good, they are always busy but have lots of staff behind the counter and I find I am never left waiting for very long as the staff are very good at juggling the customers so that you are not waiting. 

It is worth the drive across the city for a visit as long as you don't expect mass produced "beautiful" baked goods you won't be disappointed.Early and often during the first year of our relationship, my girlfriend and I would frequent Honey Pig. She had never tried Korean BBQ, so "Honey Pig!" became our battlecry after long weeks or major life events to celebrate. As time passed (but the restaurant continued to celebrate its "Grand Opening"), the quality of service became schizophrenic and unpredictable. Asking for food became a chore and the cooking of food by staff felt unnecessary and burdensome. Staff routinely overcooked some items by not tending to the heat properly, and I began fighting for the tongs between rounds.

Our disappointment with Honey Pig climaxed around the holidays. With family in town, my girlfriend and I called ahead to reserve a table for a large group. The staff accepted our reservation and we showed up promptly for service. There was no table and the staff attempted to sit six full-grown adults at a table for four. It was obvious that the staff had just seated a group of six at a table intended for us. I objected to the four person table and we proceeded to wait thirty minutes for a second table. Despite the reservation and frequent visits (we're confident they recognized us), I was furious and that was the last time we ate at Honey Pig.

My biggest concern? I'm not entirely sure who is in charge here. Not once after nearly a dozen trips to Honey Pig has an owner or manager ever greeted us. That's unacceptable and such absent-ness is beginning to show. No one has ever asked about our meal. No one has ever asked for feedback. The staff is careless and unobservant (other than one or two persons) and I was so upset after that debacle around the holidays. I was so embarrassed for my family. With the abundance of great AYCE Korean BBQ alternatives in Las Vegas, I'm surprised this place has survived after how forgiving we were trip after trip after trip. No more.WARNING!!! WI-FI CAMPERS!!! DO NOT DINE IN IF YOU WISH TO SIT DOWN! It's McDonalds. The food is designed to always be the same. Over all there is no problem there. The service can sometimes be lax. The warning at the begining should indicate the biggest problem. People are running their business from the wi-fi. Expect a min. of 3 booths taken by one person with a laptop. Managment does not care.REVISIT story

I'm so bummed to have returned here while visiting family and see how badly the service has gone down to. The food is STILL great but the ladies here have grown callous and super rude.Amazing place... loved it! The chicken was delicious and so was the pasta.  
Great selection of vine and champagne! 
Great!P.F. Chang's is one of my favorites. I recommend making a reservation unless you don't mind waiting to be seated for a while at times. The wait for me in the past has been up to a 2 hour wait so I always call ahead of time to make sure I wont have to wait too long when getting there. Parking is another thing the lot can be pretty full at times but, when people know where good food is they tend to gather!

We like getting the "Four-Course Meal For Two For $39.99". You get your choice of 2 soups, 1 appetizer, 2 entrees and 2 small desserts. For $1.95-$3.95 you can upgrade to 1 larger dessert but for us we like choosing our own smaller ones that are included in the price already. 

I love their "Egg Drop Soup". It is some of the best I have ever had. I usually always start out with "Chang's Chicken Lettuce Wraps". The lettuce is always so fresh and crisp and the chicken tastes so darn good. I just can't get enough of the lettuce wraps! We also got "Pork Fried Dumplings". These are chocked full of delicious flavored pork. If you like dumplings then these are a must and they have veggie too. For my main meal I usually get "Crispy Honey Chicken". The chicken comes with crispy rice sticks under the chicken and u tell them to leave that off so I can mix my white rice with the chicken, yum! For the dessert menu I would eat one of everything it all sounds good! The dessert I did choose this time was "Salted Caramel Chocolate Cake". Sounds good right? It was just so-so. I wasn't upset at all it was perfectly edible the flavor just didn't add up to the name so I will try a different one next time.

I had a "Strawberry Daiquiri" that was $6.50 and delicious.

There is a outdoor patio if you want to eat outside.

Check out their website. They have a "Warrior Rewards" that gives you freebies from time to time. Just for signing up you get a free order of lettuce wraps!Everything from the drinks to the food was fantastic! Chips and salSa were good. Drinks were good. We had chicken and carnitas tacos and they were delicious. Homemade tortillas made right In Front of youSat at the bar, very kind and engaging bar tender. Had the clam pasta which was delicious, and finished with the chocolate soufflée. Dessert was my favorite part, to which I did not mind the wait for it to be prepared. Very gorgeous dinner!I lived in Italy for a few years abs my wife is from Vegas, so one if my favorite things to do when we're out here I'd try different Italian places. I do feel that the staff was pretty snooby and not at all welcoming. The server was American and didn't speak any Italian. (I think nice Italian places should have Italian staff that can pronounce the menu if they write it in Italian)

The food was good and authentic, but way over priced. I have ate at many places that have better and more authentic food in Vegas. You do pay for the "wine bar"atmosphere. Very nice place, elegant, but a little too snooty for my liking. Italians are some if the most welcoming people and I like to get an Italian atmosphere when I pay as much as I did. The food you can get better for less elsewhere! If it were not for the high bill it would have got a better review, but when you charge me much higher prices, I expect better taste and better service... neither was found here.We really enjoyed our diner despite the reviews.  I was a little nervous but our server was so kind and welcoming!  We mentioned that we read review on Yelp and he happily gave us the discount. Thank you!  Our server mentioned that the owners are very receptive to Yelp.  Great experience!Great Food and A Great Place to enjoy a Ice Cold Margarita & Corona..
Very authentic decorations and the menu is so vast its quick to second guess what you wanna try. Still got great service and foos was delicious..Came in at lunch time to order to-go. The lady that served me was great and quickly submitted my order. The disappointment arrived once I came home, the sushi quality was something I would find in a grocery store or food court. I won't be back and I'll be going back to my regular sushi place Ru Sans.Hands down best Greek food I have ever had. Me and my fiancé go here once in a while for a date night, we are truly never disappointed. Staff are wonderful. :)Visiting my sister for Labor Day , & of course checking this new location out , I've been to their first location yrs back & it was bomblicious & pack . 
This new location is bigger clean & our server was nice which is a plus , when our crawfish & shrimp , sausages,  corn arrive  . 
We dig in , it was blasting full of flavor not too spicy but sweet garlic mouth watering  seafood , now I don't know who's the winner from boiling crab \/ or Hot n juicy crawfish .This was an alright place.  Review is as always only based on the food.  The parking was complimentary.  

Bacon wrapped dates: soaked in sauce and hence made the dish soggy.  Bacon was somehow over cooked and yet the dish came out lukewarm.

Empanadas: pretty heavy and salty.  The sauce on the outside is probably unnecessary as the dish is already flavorful.  The empanadas breaking was cooked well.

Serrano ham sliders:  a little salty as the ham itself is already flavorful.  There is a spicy kick that is offset well by the bleu cheese.  

Chorizo clams: broth is great.  Still  n the salty side but you get some more bread to dip into the broth.  Worth it to just be able to dip the bread.

This was enough food for two people so not bad

3.5 stars: I probably wouldn't come back often but the price and food was fair and service was pretty good from the waiterIf you want food to grab and go this is the joint. Very tasty foods, served quickly and priced fairly. Limited selection but the two we tried very good. Parking even for a few minutes could be an issue.I don't eat red meat but I tried the sirloin and bacon n blue cheese filet and they were both fantastic. I got sesame crusted salmon that was burnt and shouldn't have left the kitchen. The server and manager both corrected the problem and my second attempt was very tasty. We sat at a bar table n the ambiance  was still intimate. 
Fried spinach tastes like crispy grease - really gross. I recommend subbing (try the green beans)
I'd definitely go back but schedule reservations ahead.I came to Pasta Brioni during a work trip to Arizona. It is a conveniently located restaurant not to far from the airport with a ton of parking. They offer a wide range of Italian fares from pasta, pizza, seafood, and more. They also have a large wine list as well.

The decor reminds me of the old school NYC Italian restaurant. The dim lighting sets the right mood for drinks and food. For dinner I got the salmon with a glass of white wine. The salmon was very delicious. It was perfectly cooked and marinated. Each bite made me wanting more and more.

Overall, great food and fantastic service. I will definitely consider coming back the next time I am in town.Amazing service, ambience and food. A ton of sweet and savory options. Debit and credit cards are not accepted, but there's an ATM in house that doesn't charge a fee.

Wife ordered raspberry chocolate chip pancakes with a side of sunny side eggs. I tried the raspberry chocolate pancakes and they were on point. I ordered the sourdough banana pecan French toast. Crispy on the outside and soft on inside. It was melt in your mouth delicious. OJ and coffee were fresh and tasty.3 name changes later... "BT'z Pizza, Grill, and Sports Bar" is a decent restaurant with a matching following.  Some of their wait staff has stuck around, and a bartender or two, and it seems that the family management has made changes that tickles the fancy of several local bar patrons.

Trust me: Get the pizza. I like mine extra crispy, which they accommodate easily all the time down to flavored crusts.  BT'z has a good happy hour price for a pizza too for dine in customers only. 
Another thing... Their wings are pretty darn good. Can't go wrong here. 
Lastly, they have a surprisingly extensive selection of beers on tap.  All the classics covered, including the local brews.I went to try the general tao poutine (it was for the poutine week so i don't know if they will always do that) the poutine i ate is the one with couple of chicken nugget with a  bit of tao gravy. 

It was good but i'm a still a fan of the good old poutine and Benny BBQ is the best restaurant for a poutine, the bad news is that there's only in Longueuil, but i think if you're near jacque-cartier bridge it's just at the second exit (curé poirier ) you just have to passed under the overpass, and it's just at the first street at your right (ste-foy street).



J'ai été essayer la poutine général Tao (faite spécialement pour la semaine de la poutine je ne sais pas si il vont continuer à en faire après). La  poutine que j'ai mangée étaient celle avec quelque croquette de poulet et un peu de sauce général tao.


C'était bon, mais je suis toujours un fan de la bonne vielle poutine et le restaurant Benny  BBQ est le meilleur en fait de poutine. LA mauvaise chose est que vous pouvez trouver ce restaurant seulement à Longueuil, mais si vous êtes près du pont Jacques Cartier c'est seulement la 2 ème sortie en sortant du pont  vous passez en dessous du viaduc avant la lumière et c'est juste au coins de la rue Ste-Foy à votre droite (derrière le Esso).Great food, reasonable prices. We visited when my parents were in town and they loved it. A good alternative to the typical chain breakfast restaurants. The server was really attentive to our large party with 5  kids. Only drawback, Cozy Corner is so good that it's really popular! Big parties will have to wait a little longer, but it is worth it.Was here for an Sunday buffet. Saw a good crowd in there.

It's a buffet, so you get to eat all you need. Food was fresh and options were many. I don't eat meat and I would totally recommend this place for wide variety of options. Personal favorite is upma with coconut chutney. Unique dish is mushroom bajji, never heard \/ had this before..was yummy though.

Totally worth a try for the price you pay.It looks great from the street with its neon blue club-like interior ......but who was the genius that came up with adding a kid's jungle gym?
 
I, like another reviewer, wanted to try something new in town so I suggested this restaurant to my husband. When we entered, we were immediately greeted by the hostess who asked us where we wanted to sit.... seeing kids as we entered the place (not realizing that there was a jungle gym close by), we asked to sit as far away from kids as possible -- in the bar. But as we got comfortable with our drinks, here comes this toddler bouncing & throwing a ball in the bar area. Then, with no parent watching out for him -- or any restaurant employee for that matter -- he climbs up one of the bar stools & sits at the bar. (???!!!) Shortly thereafter a family member finds him & removes him.... but I mean, c'mon! This toddler made approx 5 unsupervised trips into the bar area...How is this acceptable?  Can't a restaurant be cited for this?  We should have asked for the check right then & there, gotten up & left.

With regards to the food: I ordered chicken with 2 sides -- of which were lukewarm by the time the dish arrived. My husband ordered ribs which he said were awful & had too much gristle.  When the server brought the different sauces to our table - one of the labels had the word "sauce" (in hand writing) spelled "sause"... If this place was trying to be classy, this just knocked it down ANOTHER notch.

The only thing I liked were the funky lamps hanging from the ceiling. To my fellow diners, don't waste your money here.

To Blue Fire Grill --  jungle gyms are for places like McDonalds. Your quality of food needs serious improvement and your establishment is a just an overall strange concept. This place used to be Espee's Tamales -- a restaurant that met a quick demise. Seriously, if your restaurant lasts 6 months I'd be shocked.This is my favourite place. I have been coming here for over 12 years and have seen the owners change. The apprentice that was following him for nearly 10 years took over and has made it even better. I love them!!!While I wasn't brave enough to try exotic concoctions, like the Mac & Cheese slice, the traditional cheese slices were scrumptious.  Great slices and friendly staff.  Great lunchtime bite.Solid option if you are looking for large portions of well made mexican food. The enchiladas are large and flavorful. The food isn't anything extroardinary, but the dishes are classic and made right.I used to work near here and LOVED the burritos here! The green chili pork one was my favorite. Tortillas are always so yummy and the salsa is fresh and delicious!Stopped here for brunch today . The service was great and the breakfast food very good! My son had the country breakfast and couldn't finish it. My husband had the special with two eggs, bacon, sausage, hash browns and toast. He actually managed to eat it all. I had egg beaters and bacon, tomato, and pancakes. I can see why there is a wait for seating. Endless coffee, hot and good. We will be back!The Greek omelette was the best I have ever had!!!  Even better than that was the genuinely warm and friendly mood of the place. Felt like I was having breakfast at my Grandmother's!!!I really don't think this place is all that special. I think that after the fuss of a grand opening and a long time waiting for the new Sam Fox concept, people were packing in but now it's slowing down. I really wasn't impressed at all.

First off, they take over the parking lot at this little shopping center like they are the big elephant in the room when there are other stores and businesses in the area that need parking space as well. Who needs that! And you can't just pull up and park -- you've got to use the valet! That's a needless hassle right there. 

When we got in, we were two of us, looking for a booth and we got seated out at a little table in the middle of the room. The lighting is bright and honestly, the place reminds me more of a Denny's than anything. It's NOT a date night place. There were tables everywhere with little kids yelling. The place is too lit up and too noisy to be the kind of cool vibe that I was looking for that night. 

I won't comment on the food, because after waiting for service and it didn't come, we got fed up and left. And we won't be back.All the food we've had here is far above average. The Greek and Italian dishes offer a wide selection of options! Here is the secret - they have a great steak at a great price. Sometimes one of us wants a steak and the other not, so we go to Dino's to the advantage of the variety that they offer.

The service is always friendly and there is always an owner or two making sure that all the food and service is great!Cute little cafe with yummy food - will come again.

Came here today with friends for a late lunchette. I was VERY apprehensive about eating here when we arrived to find out that they didn't have air conditioning. It was boiling hot outside today and the only patio seating they had that could seat our party was in direct sun. Thankfully, the breeze sort of picked up and the trees came to our rescue as the sun shifted. Overall the atmosphere turned out to be very nice!

I ordered the Mussels Marius and was pleased with my meal. At $11.50 the dish had a healthy heap of mussels in a broth that was just the right amount of garlic and tang. I asked if there was bread that I could order to go with my meal and was pleasantly surprised to get a few slices of their house cornbread free of charge. 

Definitely looking forward to coming back and trying their entres!Absolutely nasty.

Service was pretentious. I went with a guy so I got to be the little lady that was talked down to. There were more than just one server helping us out, and the rest seemed to be nice.

The tablecloth was gross and had a giant yellow crusty food stain. I asked to be moved.

Went for Summerlicious. Chose the mussels. Bad choice. It tasted like the zoo smells, which is like rotting poo. So disgusting. I had to send it back and got the safer bet (chicken) which was better.

The crowd? Old people that look like they're going to keel over any moment (and that apparently have no taste buds), probably visiting from the retirement living residences nearby.

Overall, the food was bland. The mussels were absolutely DISGUSTING and turned me off of ordering mussels ever again. Now that's a strong impression! 

The worst was that they continued to serve the mussels the rest of the night! That's GROSS. A woman sat there with a full plate of mussels not eating while her dinner companion was eating his meal. Like, it wasn't just me, there was a serious problem with the mussels!

The one pretentious server and the nasty tablecloth stain didn't help boost their star power either--and they didn't even change it! Ok maybe it would've caused a commotion, but honestly? Gross mussels that they CONTINUED TO SERVE even though they literally tasted like poo and I had to send it back telling them that they weren't fresh and that they had gone bad or something... Still serving them... Nasty. Big fat crusty tablecloth stain... Decent wine...

The other servers were nice though, and the chicken that replaced my steaming bowl of poo wasn't bad at all.

I would never recommend this place. It was one of my worst dining experiences ever.If I could give them 17 stars I would in a second. This was my 2nd time eating here and it was fantastic. The place is tiny with lines out the door on weekends, but somehow they keep it rolling smoothly and I've never had to wait for longer than ~15 minutes. The sashimi is my fave - huge chunks of amazing, tender, fresh fish arranged on a cool-looking platter on ice. So good. Akami, magura, sake, hamachi, toro, you name it and it's great. Their unagi is probably better than almost any I've ever had. I wouldn't get it as maki though. Oddly we had a sake roll last time that was a little below par compared to the rest, but I'm sure it was a fluke. The happy hour menu is a great deal and well worth it, if you don't mind smaller portions you can def eat on the cheap. Heads up on the wagu beef sliders, they might be the best appetizer they have. I've had them both times and they are off the hook! Really good mochi too.
Great sushi bar ambiance, it can get loud when people have had enough saki but never annoyingly so. And the waiters are as good with hospitality as any you'd find on the strip. Always friendly, smiling, and helpful. They keep the table loaded with food and the water glass is never empty. I usually tip around 25% because it's well deserved. There's a sushi joint on almost every corner in Vegas, but I never stray too far because....well why would I when it's such a good package deal? The prices are commensurate with good sushi in most large cities. Soho is the bomb, I'll be coming back enough to get VIP status and my own parking spot hopefully;-)Place was cleaner and cashier was very nice. This to me is a corporate owned Hawaiian BBQ place, when in Hawaii would go to local spots so sadly this place can't compare. 

Food; Got the Combo with Chicken Katie and Short Ribs, the chicken was not white meat so didn't eat it, the short ribs were actually tasty. The macaroni salad was very good.Maybe 4 stars is a little high, I would probably give three and a half if I could.  I came here for lunch and the plac was totally empty.  It's next to a charter school so there might be some kids outside smoking.  I guess it used to be a Mexican restaurant, and you can kind of tell inside from the mirrored arches.  I had the chicken curry lunch special version.  Comes with soup and a spring roll.  The portion of chicken curry was small, but for a lunch special it's not a bad deal- I think around $6.  The food itself was tasty and the service was good.  My water was always refilled.  The "atmosphere" of this place leaves a lot to be desired, but maybe if they get some more customers then they could eventually move to a nicer location.Excellent buffett, probably the best "standard hotel" buffet I've had in Vegas.  Loved the cerviches, crab legs, and salads in particular. The prime rib was quite good and it wasn't so "gorge yourself until you explode" vibe you get at cheaper buffetts around town.  

Minus points for a relatively weak dessert selection and a very weak selection of fresh fruits. There were plastic mangos everywhere, yet no mangos to be found on the buffett.The Barley House is my favorite place to go to, whether its for cocktails or a night out on the town. They have a DJ Wednesday through Saturday and is the best spot to dance , meet people or to be scene. They have a brand new lighting system so it has that Vegas style feel. Also I recommend checking out their back room, The grotto. It is the only bar in Cleveland that allows Cigars and smoking. There really isn't another bar thats comparable to Barley. Theres always a good crowd, and even if its a quiet time while you are there, the bartenders and servers will always chat it up with you, and I may add , there is pretty scenery there.  :)One bite of their burger and you can taste the freshness of the beef, vegetables, sauce, and seasoning. They cut the fries fresh and throw it straight into the fryer. Freshness is the main theme here. 

Aside from their great burgers, shakes, and fries, they have a lot of options that are not on their menu. That's what makes them intriguing. If you're a first timer, talk to any regular that's there. They will tell you things like "animal style", 4x4, and hot peppers. Just other day, I learned you can get a neopolitan milkshake! Awesome!

Their menu basically hasn't changed since the first ever restaurant opened up. That's why I love it. Whenever I go get drive thru for a certain number of people, it's pretty easy to remember what everybody wants.

Keep in mind that since everything is fresh and made to order, sometimes it takes a little longer for your order to come out, especially if the place is packed.Mmmmm. One day I felt like getting some not cooked fish with rice wrapped in a seaweed burrito. My sushi burrito tasted just as fresh as if I had jumped off a boat and killed a fish with a spear. Mmmm. Fish. Gotta love it...10\/10 experience. Mmm. Sushi is good :)This place is a cool place in Charlotte.  They have Salsa dancing on Thursdays that can get pretty busy.

I usually come here midweek, but hear that  weekends are fun too.  The bald headed bartender was very friendly and knowledgable.  The IPA I had was really good (but just a tad warm).  I am staying at the Holiday Inn across the street so this is a good low-key find right next to my hotel.   Was described as a Bank Of America bar and not a Wachovia Bar, I guess the two of them compete in this town?!?!.........Kidding.  Have fun.Place was clean and the food was good for the price. You get a lot for your money.  The TV was not working which was ok but the NBA finals were on.   
The beef lula was good. The hummus and tabbouleh was good too!  
Good place to get to go.Greeting- Yes
Vibe- Upscale diner
Service- good
Prices- Good
parking- Hotel
Food
Everything on the menu is good. I have had almost everything on it. The salads and sandwiches are the best options
Desserts- Yes. They always please. The lemon meringue tart is one to try
WIGB? yesA few reasons why this is one of the best shawarma places in town.

1) They wrap shawarma as a half moon instead of a cylinder. How many times have you bit into your shawarma and gotten a mouthful of only veggies or only meat? That's the result of a cylinder wrap. At tasty, you get a mouthful of everything on every bite. Because the half moon is flatter and has layered ingredients. Makes a huge difference in flavor.

2) I like spice. The pepper sauce at most places has too much  vinegar which takes over the flavor of the shawarma. Tasty has nice balance when adding heat.

3) the ingredients looked fresh. I hate looking into the serving dishes that my shawarma maker is taking ingredients from and seeing wilted brown lettuces and sliver - thin sliced wizened tomatoes. Tasty's ingredients seemed fresh. 

Want to take this shawarma to the next level? Add a little bit more quantity of ingredients and Tahini to keep it juicy. And it would be hands down the best shawarma in the city.

Hope you enjoy it.This place is great to enjoy drinks in a nice quiet atmosphere (patio area). Love coming with friends & catching up.We've dined at BJ's many times and had both decent and not-so-decent experiences. I doubt we'll be back after this last time. There were four of us and we had appetizers, cocktails, dinners, and dessert. One of the entrees came with soup or salad and tortilla soup was ordered. When it arrived it was barely luke warm. By the time our server, Lacee, came around we told her that the soup was cold and asked if it could be reheated. She took it away without a word but before she returned all of our entrees arrived. When she got back with the soup she started to pour the broth over the dry ingredients without even asking if we still wanted it since we were already eating our dinners. When we said that we no longer wanted it because our dinners were already there, she rolled her eyes, made a face, and left the table while we were still talking to her. The rest of the meal was uneventful, the food was adequate although certainly not exceptional. The server tried to be more friendly towards the end of the meal but never once apologized for the cold soup. On our way out we stopped to tell the manager (according to the receipt the manager was April) what had happened and she could not have been more unconcerned. She smiled and listened but made no apologies nor did she even mention anything about talking to the server about the rolling of the eyes and the face she made. She obviously didn't care that her customers were less than satisfied. This is not the first time that we've had what I would consider poor service for the caliber of restaurant. Between mediocre food and mediocre service we won't be returning which is sad because it's a beautiful restaurant with an extensive menu.This place is definitely a gem in disguise. My husband and I went here for dinner. We had the nachos for an appetizer which were great, I had the Cajun steak hoagie, and he had the chicken ranchero wrap. All of our choices were good.. They also have crazy specials throughout the week for food and drinks, so we will definitely be back! You can park across the street in a lot which is convenient because the bar is located on a main road. There is a separate dining area which is nice. Can't wait to try the pizza!Came here on a Friday night without reservations and was immediately seated! The restaurant is located on the second floor of the Tiff light box, and is absolutely beautiful. The five of us weren't too hungry so we primarily focused on the mains rather than apps and desserts. I had the piglet on mustard spaetzle, and it was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. The portion size was huge, and the pork was perfectly cooked - crispy skin, perfectly rendered fat, and moist succulent meat. The spaetzle and apples were the perfect pairing. My friends were also all really happy with their meals too (the braised short ribs especially). I fund the service to be pleasant and attentive, and the price per main to be very reasonable.

My only negative was that they charged us $2.50 each for still water! Who does that?! Anyway, aside from this minor point it was an excellent meal and I would definitely return.A good mozzarella sandwich for Arizona but NOWHERE NEAR the one I had back in Jersey at Joe Leone's in Pt. Pleasant. 
I had to park down the street, even on a Saturday at 2pm. Paid $20 to take home a Mozzarella\/tomato& basil, and a Soppressata\/provalone& roasted pepper. The hubby agreed: they were good, not great. Had to add salt & pepper to the mozz sandwich; not a good thing... 
Bread is very good, but it's that tough, rustic thin focaccia style which makes my mouth sore from chewing. Not a big fan of that. Also, they were sold out of the Sandwich Special of the Day so that left me with exactly 3 to coose from. Not enough variety.The service at this location has always been below par at best but this past Sunday took the cake.  Stopped in to grab a couple of "quick" coffees this past Sunday.  After waiting in line to order and pay the pot ran dry after the 1st cup, 2 other coffee types were also empty.  Was informed it was brewing and it would be a few minutes.  After another 10 minutes went to the widow where I was told they were doing the best they could.  Come on can't even keep up with brewing coffee? Handed the manager my cup and left.  Received a survey a day later and completed it providing my phone number as requested.  Received an email from Panera "Customer Care" yesterday requesting the phone # I already provided.  Gave them my number again and RADIO SILENCE.  
Great job Panera!!!!
If you want to keep your blood pressure in check go elsewhere.I like this place. I feel like like its underrated. The food is delicious and I like the restaurant it feel quiet and peaceful.I love this place and I always forget about it.  It's such an adorable spot with great hummus\/tabbouleh and a sinful gyro platter.  The best part about it is the outdoor patio, it's simply adorned with those soft glowy light bulbs on a string and a bunch of potted plants.  A wonderful place to sit with a magnum bottle of BYOB wine and watch Ellsworth go by.  The food is flavorful and inexpensive, and the family who runs it is very sweet.  I wouldn't necessarily say it was destination dining, but I think anyone who lives in the area would be hard pressed to find a better casual spot to become a regular.Authentic Italian food. My family and I
Moved from New York State to Arizona last year. Our hometown had a plethora of good Italian restaurants and we had difficulty finding "authentic" Italian food. We eventually found it here. The food is delicious. As the namesake says, the owners are from Brooklyn. They are extremely friendly and inviting, too.Amazing Pizza!  Super fresh from the oven to your table.  The speciality pizzas are on point, or you can create your own.  The service was excellent.  They also have my favorite pumpkin ale for the fall season.  We have dined in and ordered takeout, but the best is when you dine in.  They salads are pretty fresh too.  Their house made ranch dressing is one of the best I have ever tasted.  Enjoy!We come here every time we're in Vegas which is like 6 times a year and this is by far the worst time here! We usually always get the Croque Monsieur and this time it was bad. The server was not good at all he did nothing to make our visit good! I complained about my food and proceeded to argue with me. Also I ordered and blueberry and elderflower martinis which used to be on the menu it wasn't good. Very disappointed I'm not sure if we will come back based on the last visit!KJ(Kevin Johnson) former Phoenix suns guard and mayor of Sacramento is the new owner here.  So shocked to see him working the room and even pitching in.  Lo Lo has always been hit or miss in the past.  It's not Roscoes which people routinely judge it against.  That's not fair. By itself it is a great spot for breakfast.  Chicken is crisp and full of flavor.  My one complaint...KJ...get those waffles to the table piping hot.  Butter should be able to melt on them. They have always come out Luke warm and today was not much better.  Still very good, just trying to help out.  See you next time.Its a pool hall, the best pool hall in Vegas though. I wouldn't go here for drinks and dinner unless I was playing pool though. The staff is friendly, I didn't notice a pro shop which would be nice here.For a birthday a group of us went to Good Catch. It was perfect since we shared a ton of food and had the chance to try a bit of everything. The menu is very broad with many options that can be customized. The Cajun fries are so thin and crispy! The soft shell crab came with a tasty dipping sauce that was great with everything. I would recommend the good catch house seasoning blend if getting one of the steamed bags. Our server was Jo Yee. She is so sweet and was great at making sure we ordered enough and really helped us pick our dishes!This is my first time in here since they're rebranded everything seems really good the place its clean  the food is devilishly good not much of a decor but who cares i just picked up my order and left not sure whats going on in here tho cause the old staff still is in place so they just had a name change i guess  but its bussier than before and better food quality like the AAA BEEF and so on and its right on Richmond & Peter street so can't go wong ....Visited on a Wednesday night around 7:30 at night.  It was not busy at all so there was no wait to get in.  The best way to describe it is a gourmet buffet.  Everything was 'fancy food', which is what they are going for.  For me, I'm not into high end restaurants, I like basic food, not basic food with extra spices and odd combinations.  

Also, maybe it was the time we went, but they seemed to be out of a lot of food.  I see a lot of choices in the pictures posted on here, but don't remember seeing it while visiting.  There were also several counters that looked empty, like food was once there, but now isn't.

That being said, there were a few things I liked, like the bottled water left at the table, nice to not have to wait for refills.  I also liked the portions.  If I didn't like something, I didn't feel like I was wasting very much.  The jerk chicken and fried chicken wings were good.  Deserts are always a win.  

That being said, take a look at the pictures online and you can see what you're buying.  For me, it was a one time splurge.Blown away by the large tasting menu. The menu was seafood-heavy and everything I tasted was delicious. My favorites were the prawns two ways, lamb and the smoked catfish. Have to admit I shuddered when I heard catfish because it can get fishy if not prepared right, but this was so delicate and mild I wish I had more on the plate! The shallot soubise it came with was so good I wanted to lick the plate...The preserved peach with elderflower jelly had the perfect balance between sweet and tart. This was the splurge meal of my visit and did not disappoint. Servers were very knowledgeable and patient about explaining the dishes and answering questions.Nice personal, the best food. Nice place. Wine menu its large. I recommend. Belagio hotel.Giant Burger's food is fantastic. The hamburgers are made with 100% beef and taste homemade. Their garden burger is made with a Boca patty that is grilled to heavenly perfection (you must try it with mushrooms yum!). Whichever burger you choose, it will be freaking huge. Their fries are cooked in canola oil and they are just the right amount of crispy. I had a chocolate shake which was big enough to share but I wouldn't dare share something so amazing. The only thing that bothered me was the hamburger buns. It's like they were steamed. After the bun touches a wet tomato and onion the bread becomes kind of soggy but still edible and delicious. I prefer a grilled bun so I will ask for a grilled bun the next time. Also their shakes are not very thick. However, the shakes do have an exquisite taste and the amount that you get for the price is awesome. Everything is reasonably priced! I'll be back for sure!Very elegant space. We sat at the bar. We were told since we didnt have reservations. Well the restaurant was 80% empty. Hmmm. Anyway the barkeep was entertaining, gave recommendations and we were happy with out choices. Its a bit pricey and the chefs table brunch was not too impressive.  Coffee is served in tiny mugs but refills were granted. I think i had 4 refills. Anyway it was our farewell to cle brunch. A beautiful space in a beautiful museum (free too!).Great BBQ, good burgers, possibly the best mac and cheese I've ever eaten.  GO there NOW!Not a lot to choose from but many toppings for your salad. The pizza wasn't that good and they didn't have my favorite soup (broccoli cheddar) but it's all you can eat so I can't complain too much I guess.Surprised to have a good sushi place like this in Fountain Hills.  Can get expensive, but eat in or take out is always great.  Fun to mingle with the chef while making the sushi.Cool place!
We went there for breakfast! - not really breakfast more like brunch  (breakfast at 1 pm). The coffee was great.
Pancakes are huge: there were 3 of them and I barely finished one. Freshly made with butter and syrup. 
very nice bright purple sofas - perfect place for pictures.
Thus, I recommend this place for breakfast or lunch or casual dinner.I always just get the hotdog and soda combo for $1.50.   Price is right and always hits the spot.  For a food court inside of a Costco, it's good.  The wife loves the frozen yogurt.   I think today I'm gonna try a churro and see what's up with it.  Sometimes seating is limited on weekends.  But if you want a big, tasty hot dog on the cheap and a drink.  This is your place.  They have a nice assortment of condiments.   Ketchup, mustard, raw onion, relish.   Haven't tried any of the other items yet except for the pizza which I thought was decent.This place is tiny and seating is very limited - I would only recommend this for take-out, never dine-in. Extremely fast service and very good sushi. If you are looking for a nice dine-in sushi experience with fancy presentation, you are not getting that here. Just great sushi on the go.Going to chime in to say that the selection is great, food is delicious, the Yelp stars are well worth it, and the price is justified.

It was about $30 per person including drinks and the food (for a buffet) has very good standards!

Went on Wednesday night at 6 PM with a 20 minute wait. The service was attentive. The place was clean.

As a person who usually goes to cheap buffets, I was impressed with the selection of food (main course, salad, and dessert) they have. It's very well diverse while maintaining their quality. The only complaint I have would be the pastas. The marinara pasta's flavor was weak and the creamy pastas were very grainy (due to the cheesy sauce.)

The highlight? Prime rib. Add mashed potatoes, mashed yam, grilled mushroom & veggies (zuchinni and squash) make a perfect comfort food plate! I'm not a huge crab person so I can't criticize it (it was good though) but I can tell you their baked sea bass was perfect. Also, their sushi is surprisingly good for a buffet. If you like raw fish then you won't be disappointed. They've got the nigiris and poke salmon\/tuna. The seaweed salad gets a thumbs up too.

Dessert? Yes! I usually hate dessert at buffets but I was nodding after every bite.

My first buffet at the Vegas Strip was Paris' Le Village for a few bucks less and I can tell you, you're better off coming to Bellagio. 
Next time I come back to Vegas, I'm going back to Bellagio for more stomach-stuffing.01.22.12

Sunday afternoon.  Checked out of hotel.  Checked baggage until takeoff.  Hungover.  Need H2O.  Need food.

In goes the group to Ocean One.  $5.99 lunch specials are the way to go.  Along with a gallon of water.

Not bad for a tilapia meal under $10.Food was okay. I asked to make sure that my to go order has a salad dressing.  Without looking he said "yes, of course all salads have dressing"  the salad was dry and not good without dressing.  Doubt I will go back.  Sorry.Really enjoyed the grouper sandwich and the fries were delicious!! The coleslaw on the grouper sandwich was so good - truly set it off. Also, my husband really liked his chicken sandwich with bacon.I drive here from downtown to devour plate after plate of roti canai, the best I've found in the city. The other food is decent, but that's what you deserve for trying anything other than that crunchy chewy buttery roti. Full disclosure: I just ate 3 orders. Bonus points go to this place for the impromptu karaoke sessions by owner "Yummy Forever" during dinner.I come in here almost every morning for a smoothie and man are they good. I recently found out about the the pinkberry smoothie and I am addicted. The store is very clean and the staff are always friendly and helpful. After the pinkberry I love the blueberry bliss. They also make wheatgrass juice which is good for my workout. I simply love this place so much that I go almost everyday before work. Highly recommended.The food was ok BUT what is a real turn off is if you get take out food they have the nerve to ADD ON a 10% tip to your take out bill.

To me you give a tip to someone who has preformed a service like serving you dinner or drinks. You tip a waitress or waiter...

If you ask them to remove the tip their answer is no..

This is simply WRONG...Is Sweet is a Very nice new place to come grab a drink a dessert! The people working there are very nice and friendly! I really like their drinks! Definitely will come back for a visit!!The best place to get boba! They have a wide variety of flavors to choose from. The boba is always fresh, not too big, not too small. Sometimes when a location gets busy, the service declines. Definitely not the case here. They are always happy, always greeting you,  and always makes sure you are satisfied. I go there to get the taro milk slush (With real taro on top), milk tea with boba, or hot jasmine tea (omg so good!) I recommend all my friends to go here!!Great little BBQ place in town square. Staff and service are always on point and they have a decent beer selection.Brio has never done me wrong.  We go here all the time and it's always good. Thank you for being so consistent.  My fave starters.   Lobster bisque and blue cheese wedge salad.   The healthy menu item with the chicken and quinoa is so good.we happened upon Olive & Ivy while touring scottsdale yesterday, and needed a lunch spot quick (we love to eat, and when we get together, its basically an eating festival).  we took a look at the menu and decided to go for the cheaper option of the counter service were i got a $7 salad of mixed greens, two cherry tomatoes and an ice cream scoop of tuna.  it was okay. it did the trick.  my friend ate a curry chicken pita which looked excellent and which she enjoyed.  

our server\/cashier girl was very nice and suggested a drink that my friend tried and liked. and she was quick with the service, so all in all, a good experience. i wouldn't particularly call this place mediterranean, but it's definitely targeting rich people who care about having 8 different brands of bottled water to choose from.I love that they have a section of vegetarian rolls and a few fully cooked choices. I had the Sakura roll, sweet potato roll and tofu steak appetizer. I'm looking forward to eating here again!Stopped in Wed. afternoon with the kids (11 & 12) for a bite after doing some errands. It's loud here, but that's the kind of place it is. The day's special, X-L pizza w\/ 1 topping was $10. It was about a 16 inch and pretty good. We left full and took half home. We will definitely come back to try more off the menu. Lots of daily specials and happy hour\/bar hour discounts. Worth the first try, and a second.A hidden gem on the Vegas strip!! If only I had found this sooner than our last day in Vegas. Slightly tacky decor, but isn't everything slightly tacky in Vegas? Cheap prices, large portions and delicious food! Friendly waitstaff. They take a complimentary picture for you to keep as a souvenir! The scorpion drink is huge and fabulous!The young man who took my order at 10 last Sunday night was nice and wanted to talk football because I was wearing a Colts shirt which was nice....friendlier than most...ordered double cheese burger combo....I thiink it was #2 of 3 choices ...could have ordered something from secret menu but just wanted something basic at that time of night...if it wasn't the greasiest burger I've ever had I can't remember when I've eaten anything greasier....not as good as Steak and Shake or Fatburger.I love this place. I come here all the time when I go to Vegas. Stone Crabs are a must.  I usually get their lunch specials. I wasn't too fond of the filet mignon. The first time I had this, I got swordfish. That was awesome. I think their fish entrees are good. Seafood platter is ok, but it's not my top choice.  The service is amazing and the bread is great. I would also suggest making reservations either on yelp or call-in cuz it does get busy. I prefer sitting outside where the forum shops are. Make sure you say seating in the forum shop area and not outside cuz they got my reservation confused with outdoor seating and we ended up just sitting inside.Went here while visiting my parents for Christmas.  It is tucked in the corner right next to Paradise Bakery if you have a hard time finding it. 

This is basically Chipotle for pizzas.  They have set salads & build your own salad as well.  My parents chose this option and they really enjoyed their salads, but they are pretty big so they were unable to finish them.

The line was decent size, but went very quick.  The pizza options were broken down to several categories: sauce, cheese, meat, veggies, and fresh herbs.  They do not charge more for adding any of the options (don't know if you ask for extra portions though).  I suggest that you do not get fresh tomato, it makes the pizza very soggy afterwards.  I made the mistake, don't repeat it!  Other than that, my pizza was delicious!  I also had the Pookie, just love that name!  Don't be surprised, it is a normal sized cookie.  I am so used to huge cookies done this way, but it's only $3 so you cannot expect too much.  

Warning, they do have Pepsi products!  Boo!  They also do have a nice selection of iced teas so that made up for the Pepsi faux pas. 

Will I be back?  Definitely, but will not order the fresh tomatoes on my pizza.Great Mediterranean food for an economical price and it's only 15 minutes from the house.  Lots of choices on the menu and we have been impressed with the spanakopita and dolmades...not to mention the feta fries.  We will definitely be back.I absolutely love the South Charlotte Chef!!! The meals are amazing and portioned well enough that I do not have to cook at all.  The lamb is amazing as well as all the dishes.  I highly recommend them.  Chef Sandra is very friendly and totally awesome!!!When I moved to Las Vegas, there was one or two Indian restaurants. Today, there is a plethora scattered around every part of the valley. Some have come and gone. Many of which I have yet to try. Being that my husband is from Northern India, I have an advantage of knowing quality and authentic. Yelpers, be rest assured, this is the real deal, a true gem! I enjoy buffets because it offers a wide variety of things to try. The buffet here certainly has no shortage of options. And, the selection changes each day, so to have plenty of chances to try the menu. Today we enjoyed sag aloo (spinach and potato), Chana Masala (chick peas), navritran korma, samosas, naan, tika Masala, and a choice of plain rice or pilau. There were a total of 15 dishes, plus the salad and sauce bar. There are vegetarian dishes, chicken and goat. The decor is warm and inviting and very clean. Service is attentive and friendly. The owner came around to ensure we were all content. We arrived 11:15, and there were already many tables occupied. I look forward to bringing friends here and to many happy returns.Better than expected. 

We went here to meet some friends. It is definitely fast food dressed up, but the pizza was good. Salads were nicely sized as well. The outdoor seating was right in the middle of the State St sidewalk and had great views of everything, which was nice.We've tried this First Friday hotspot a couple times. Service is good, staff very friendly and accomodating. We usually come with large parties of 10 or more and manage to get seated right away. The chef prepares a tasty selection of tapas ...faves include garlic chicken, paella, mac & cheese. But you may want to file a police report because you will get ROBBED! $15 for a tapas size mini bowl of paella will not only leave you hungry but feeling jilted...and empty...oh wait that's your wallet. Tonight we spent over $100 to feed 4 and still managed to look longingly at the roach coach nearby serving up garlic fries. B&B's food is ok but not worth the entrée prices for a "sampling" of food.I went to Radio Maria for lunch on my birthday with my parents, who drove in from out of town. It turned out to be the worst dinning experience I have ever had. Our waiter William ignored us during the entire time. He completely forgot our appetizer.  When I tried to ask about it with the other servers they ignored me as well. the appetizer finally came after we were done with our meals and our waiter did not even bother to apologize. 

The food was horrible. My mothers mahi mahi was the driest piece of fish I have ever seen. The portions were extremely small. The "sea food plate", a $12 lunch entree, came with ONE scallop, THREE tiny shrimps and a piece of dried up fish smaller than the size of two quarters. We were all so hungry after the meal we had to go to another restaurant for more food. 

When I mentioned my poor experience with the manager on duty, he started to make excuses and argue with me. He didn't even bother to apologize. 

Bad food, bad service. I will never return to this restaurant again. Not for lunch, not for dinner, not for drinks, not for salsa, not for anything. I will tell all my friends to avoid going there for get togethers from now on.This is the Only place I order from now.  Turkey hoagie with house dressing is amazing.  Salads always fresh.  The Calzone is no joke and they have really good moz sticks.  I could drink their marinara.Not your typical airport food... this was a welcome relief to a frequent travelers palate.   

Highly recommended if you have a few $$'s leftover from your travels and a layover!!I used to really like Del Mar, heck I go out of my way to eat here all when I'm in LV. But this last visit was disappointing. My sandwich was dry and plain with no extras, yet it was still nearly $20 bucks. 

Generally the deserts are amazing and I can't vouch for all of them but the one I ordered was old and dried out. Large yes, tasty? Not really. 

The second to last time I was here I had a great soup, a tasty sandwich and a wonderful apple turnover. That was back in February. But the last time it was also not as good as it should have been for the high prices.

I hope I got them on a bad night and that things will improve and return to the high quality and value. I'll try them again next time I'm in town but if they fail again it will be my last.This taco bell is amazing at always letting you down.... Every time we go to this location our orders are either missing items or not properly prepared.St. Francis is a truly great gathering spot.  I've come here a few times with friends and family and I always enjoy the atmosphere, the outside seating is nice even when it might seem to hot to go out.  They have a wonderful happy hour and who doesn't appreciate locally sourced ingredients.  They are always happy to accommodate and one night they let my girlfriends and I stay even after they had closed up shop and were about to finish cleaning the place.  That's what I call great customer service!

The desserts at St. Francis are my favorite.  I've devoured the sticky toffee pudding and the Apple Crumb Tart,  you should enjoy them at some point too.  I feel that this picture of the Apple Crumb Tart speaks for itself, you would be a fool to skip dessert here.

My favorite dish at St. Francis, other than dessert, is the Pig Dip.  The pork loin is cooked perfectly, I'm a sucker for prosciutto and bacon and the fennel marmalade, Dijon and Gruyere make my taste buds scream for joy.  I have to state for the record that I have not had brunch here yet and it always looks fantastic when I see people posting pictures.The worst Papa John's experience I've ever had! I ordered Pizza for my coworkers and had the Pizza's delivered to my job. Not only did they get one of the Pie toppings incorrect but they just didn't taste good. Was not the Papa Johns quality we were use to...When I called to advise one of our pies were incorrect, the Cashier who answered the phone literally argued with me telling me I was wrong! He stated he was the one that took my order and he knew what he heard! I couldn't believe what I was hearing!!! I asked to speak to the manager and I was then told that they could make another Pizza and have it delivered. The correct pizza came an hour later! Never again will my job be ordering from this location!! Customer service is vital to any establishment and bad service is NOT acceptable!We had the restaurant week lunch with the braised short rib.  The French onion soup was pretty good, but the risotto was extremely undercooked.  It was so chewy that we couldn't eat it.  The undercooked onions also were not peeled.  There was a layer of skin that we had to spit out.  The short rib was larger than I expected and very tender, but also very bland.  The best thing on the plate was the carrots because I actually like raw carrots.

This place is a shame to any chef's name.Terrible food and even worse prices. Plus why ask me for my name when I'm your only patron? 

The steak and bacon tacos were barely edible. I wanted to try something different since we don't have this chain in the Windy City but I was not impressed. The food was so terrible I got McDonald's to make up for it!

Visit Date: 11\/16\/09Finally I am satisfied with Mexican food in the burgh since this place was brought to my attention via yelp. Thanks a lot!

I came here around lunch time on a Wednesday and was happy to see a few people already enjoying their meals in the small dining room. I went a little overboard on ordering because their was so much to choose from and I had high hopes for this place. We order among two people; 2 fish tacos, 1 chicken taco, 1 Tostada, and the California Burrito and horchata. This was a ton of food holy cow and all for under $19. The California Burrito was so good that I devoured it so fast that I almost forgot to check what was in it. I did figure that there was grilled and cubed steak (possibly flank as it was lean), fries, a small amount of standard veggies, guacamole. But it so hit the spot and filled me up with that alone. The Tacos were also really tasty bites, they were pretty standard tacos with a soft corn tortilla shell filled with fresh salsa lettuce, tomato and your choice of Guacamole or sour cream, as well as your choice of Meat in my case order chicken and fish. Cooked perfectly. 

I recommend trying the horchata, if your not familiar it is sort of like a rice water based beverage. For $2 you get a huge glass of it and was very refreshing on a blustery cold afternoon. The dude at the counter was very patient with me as I did ask a number of questions about the menu because there was some stuff on there that I had never seen or heard of. The place did definitely remind me of the many taco stands that I have experienced in the Southwest, and Tijuana and Baja. Just a heck of a lot cleaner. 

This place has ample parking and great prices, I sure hope this place lasts, I could have lunch here everyday. If you like tacos and burritos, you have to go check this joint out.we were driving thru coming back from Grand Canyon...bumped into.this place...it was delicious!! everything was great!Stopped here during a layover for a quick lunch. I tried to get a Cuban panini but was told by the woman behind the counter "we aren't doing panini's now".

Settled for a turkey club on an everything bagel. Had to repeat to them 4 times that I didn't want tomato or mustard and my sandwich still came out wrong (they forgot the bacon). Didn't think I needed to specify that in a club sandwich. 

The sandwich was fine for an airport turkey sandwich, except they botched my order despite me telling them what I wanted multiple times.Pretty much exactly what one would expect from a taco joint like this one. Visited here at 5:00am due to minimal open restaurants and a slight craving for some tacos. I ordered their breakfast burrito and a few carne asada tacos. 

The meat quality in the tacos was very poor and bland, the cilantro\/tomato and other veggies inside the taco tasted like they were left in room temperature. The lack of fresh veggies and grade F meat combined for a mediocre taco at best. 

The breakfast burrito which consisted of steak, cheese, and eggs also disappointed on the same level as the tacos. The taste was extremely bland and the steak had qualities more align with rubber than it did beef. One pro is the size of the burrito which was bigger than a burrito from chipotle. Although, it's a bit ironic because who wants to eat more of something they don't enjoy...

This would be a 1 star review but it is 2 because of the good service that was provided by the single man running the entire place. The order also came out surprisingly quick given that one man ran the register and prepared the food. 

Unless it's a lack of options, I will most likely not return.I drive by this market daily. For some reason it popped into my head that they might serve food, and I thought, if they do, I bet it's amazing. I looked on Yelp and Google, and sure enough... tacos, burritos, and more at this little market! I tried the Pastor taco and a Carne Asada burrito. Both were awesome! I look forward to trying more varieties of the tacos. The burrito had a toasted tortilla and fit so many great toppings inside! (Without busting open like other places.) Plus, the total was $11, which would beyond fill me up! What an awesome find! And maybe dangerous...Awesome service awesome breakfast.  So glad they don't salt and pepper the food.  Due to everyone on blood pressure pills happy that chef does not salt food cooked.  Great experience will be back.Maybe it was all the martinis... Or maybe this really was one of the best slices I've ever had!!! I tried the white pizza and dang! That ish is tasty!!Went there today and they were permanently closed. Another restaurant is moving in. Too bad since I only got to enjoy it once.I really enjoyed eating here.  I liked the decorating and it was inviting.  I got the filet mignon and it was good but could have used a little more salt.  I tried the sun chokes for the first time and loved them.  Loved the bread!  I liked the warm frisée salad but there was a lot of it for just one person.  Would definitely go back.Wow just discovered paella heaven!  If you're adventurous try the paella negro.  A little taste of Barcelona in Vegas baby!!Awesome food and service. Great deals on food. We come here at least once a week. 
The new three for ten deal is wonderful!!!!!The go to place for Korean food in Vegas!  It definitely helps if you know what to order or have some knowlege of Korean dishes. The combo deals are great but in general the foods are with added Vegas premium.

Don't expect the top notch Korean food from L.A. or Fort Lee\/NYC but pretty good enough to my satisfaction.Food is very fried, which is not something I enjoy. 

The salad bar appears unappetizing between the very soggy lettuce and the greyish eggs. 

I was very amused to see that they had A&E on their TVs after reading another review where they had brought their kids and had to watch one of the crime shows. We also had crime shows! That didn't bother us at all but I did find it amusing. 

Our server was very pleasant and we had a great time. 

The decor is lackluster and the place was very empty. 

The biggest factor in the low star rating was the food. It wasn't tasty and it stuck with me for a long time. It was not my cup of tea.Good food...fast and friendly. We got all the appetizers and had a sample of them all was so delicious. Love the Ox Tail chili cheese fries!!There good and quick never really had a problem just not a fan of those mini sausages or meatballs but I do like there crust and wings are good.There are so many sushi AYCE places out here in Vegas.  As a result, I just chose one of the new places - Sushi Neko.  One of the cool things about this place is that they don't limit the number of rounds that you can order, which obviously is awesome because you can better gauge how much more you can handle\/want to eat.  I don't know if there was a time limit or not, but it was nice that the food came out pretty quickly.  One of my biggest sushi AYCE peeves is that subsequent rounds take forever to come out, but I was glad that this was not the case here.  Well, I guess that the restaurant had maybe 3-4 other tables occupied, so that could be a reason why food came out super fast.  But, overall, the service was very good.  The waiters were very friendly, took dirty plates away quickly, and also got all of my orders correctly.  The menu is very, very big so it was definitely difficult to pick which things to eat.  There was everything from nigiri to BBQ skewers to mini udon bowls.  Big mistake on my part was I went to eat by myself, therefore, I didn't get to try as many things as I would have wanted.  Be sure to bring friends when you go so that you can try everything!

On to the food - the nigiri was overall very good.  Salmon belly and unagi are my favorites and they absolutely did not disappoint.  The fish to rice ratio was amazing, which is the one thing about a sushi restaurant that can either make or break my experience.  Unfortunately, the yellowtail was a little icy (frozen fish, perhaps).  I was not a fan of that one and would not get it again for that reason.  The appetizers were average - I had miso soup, salad, and calamri.  The miso was a little on the salty side.  Salad was nothing special, but was refreshing.  The calamari was served with a generic sweet chili sauce, which was mediocre.  Unfortunately, what was most disappointing for me was the actual rolls.  They were drenched in sauces and mayonnaise; it was so excessive that it ruined the experience of eating the fish.  If I were to come back, I'd either stick to just nigiri or pick rolls that didn't come with some sort of sauce.

A big perk is that there are a handful of desserts that you can choose from at the end of your meal.  I got the mango mochi and the tempura ice cream, which both were very delicious!

An AYCE meal here costs $21 at lunch and $26 at dinner, which is pretty typical for any AYCE sushi place.  I'm not sure if Vegas has better AYCE sushi places out here, but this place is pretty good and I'd definitely come back and get a ton of nigiri.Last night the food was bang-on finally! We had the sisig with garlic rice & kare-kare, it was super delicious. Casa Manila food has finally "arrived" after it was featured at the Food network 2 years ago, with a more steady patronage the food has not only improved, but even the choices have also improved. Keep it up Casa Manila, yey!Best new downtown joint for sure. This place is great for all sessions. The brunch is delicious. Lunch and dinner are on point. The patio is amazing. I am curious to see what it is going to be like in the dead of summer. Might be a bit too hot to hangout there unless they have a nice misting system with some large swamp coolers hanging out. 

This place is our first go to for going out on a Friday or Saturday night. Great vibe and atmosphere.I don't know anything about German food. This place was close to where we working for the day and we figured we would stop in. Had a group of 5 of us and came in for a workday lunch. I had a pretzel with cheese which was incredible. They baked it fresh and brought it right out of the oven. It was great. 

Then I had the sausage with potatoes and red cabbage. I was very skeptical of the cabbage but the entire meal was just incredible. the staff was great too! They are from Germany, very hospitable and helped with recommending items on the menu. I am now a German food fan! Can't wait to go back.Chef Tarun Kapoor is big LIAR and DISHONEST........By far the worst restaurant experience ever. I took my parents, who are visiting from India, to this place for dinner and seriously regret my decision. Haven't had such a bad indian food even in remote areas of USA. I was most hurt by the lies of  chef Tarun kapoor, he insisted us to take dinner buffett again and again, I was skeptic that this might be left overs from lunch and when I questioned it he made up a story that big party is coming shortly whom asked for this buffett, and it's a good selection. I trusted the chef and oh God that was the biggest mistake. Buffett had three items, soup, pav bhaji and some snack with super bad taste  never heard of it before. 
We asked him to change the stuff to which he said he can't and offered us instead take 2 extra entrees to cover up his lies. I was with my parents and don't want to create any scene so I said yes to that, and needless to say those entrees were even worst.

We got off from our chairs to leave the place without eating it, and this shameless chef brought check for that buffett which we didn't eat at all. I mean one can't go beyond this level

It's a shame that such people are running restaurants.
In strong words won't recommend this place to anyone not because of my bad experience but the quality of food which may get you sickVegetarian: 
I got a 6 inch sub with the Veggie Patti, which is made of soy. I also got a variety of vegetables and sauces. It was good and consistent with what I have come to expect from Subway. 

Meat: 
My cousins got kids meals. One with roast beef and the other with turkey with a variety of toppings. The meals came with an Honest Kids juice box, they said the juice was flavorless, and chips. They enjoyed the meals overall.

Overall: 
Service was fast the staff was polite. The restaurant was clean and quiet. Our total was$15 so I was happy with the price.Visiting for a weekend and I searched for an organic juice bar, so happy I found this place! It's like heaven on earth. I made sure to stop in every morning of my trip to try something new, and everything was amazing and the girls are very sweet. Great place!1st, I swear the beans are Hormel chilli. ..which is just ew for a supposed Mexican place. Just no. Why? The rice has no flavor for "cilantro lime"...Chipotle is better.  2nd the margaritas are awesome and strong (maybe so you get drunk and forget that the beans are probably chilli from a can?). So, go here fo the bar and NOT for the beans. The steak tacos were good but we just couldn't get over the beans and rice...yuck! Even worse that they had the nerve to put those godforsaken  beans and rice in my husband's burrito. Double yuck!Wow!  I think we had some of the best fried chicken ever!  I'd have to say both service and food is outstanding at Yardbirds.  This was our first visit there and what a treat it was.  We will return next time we are in Vegas!Great little local place.  Seating is limited.  Find a way to try the baked goods.  The cinnamon twist will leave you planning your next fix, err... visit.I did expect the restaurant to be more upscale we made a reservation and were well dressed and saw others casually dressed in shorts and flip flops. From the outside you don't expect it to be a gourmet restaurant it has fresh foods and great flavors. We started with these Salmon Puffs so good, puffy little breads with smoked salmon and cream cheese. for my entree I had chicken with a mushroom sauce and it was very yummy.Amazing veggie sandwich ever! The service is always pleasant and the food is delicious!! You should definitely try it :)Great price, decent selection, and friendly staff. Yes, it's "buffet style" so you'll have to get your own meats but it's a good format and I'm already used to it so no big deal for me.

I would suggest going for the dinner as there's a better selection and for the price, it's a great deal. Been here a few times and I'm sure I'll be going here again when I'm in Vegas.

FYI, there's a limit on the Kalbi (4 per person) but you can pay extra for unlimited.I really enjoyed my Chicken Works Philly, sweet potato fries, and fried ravioli. I can't wait to try some of the other sandwiches and sides. It's definitely a bit fast-paced and a very casual spot, so expect to be in and out with a satisfied palette and wallet, in no time.Came here on a Sunday afternoon for brunch. There was a line up out front but luckily I was able to skip it since my friends were already inside. I ordered the hungry gal, which came with scrambled eggs, toast, hash browns, and a fruit salad, and I got coffee to drink. The food itself was pretty good, but the coffee not at all. They had a bunch of other things on the menu that I would have liked to try and their waiters were quick to serve and friendly, so I wouldn't mind going again but I'm not too keen about it just yet. Overall, 3\/5.Yikes, no thank you!  I remember coming here as a teenager and loving it but I honestly think that my standards were a lot lower back then.  

The customer service was pretty good but the food was really bland and mediocre.  Thankfully the buffet didn't cost much compared to other Las Vegas buffets but I was so disappointed in the food.  They have a wide variety to choose from but in all honesty, I only enjoyed one thing: their fried chicken.  Their fried chicken is really tasty and crispy and everything else was just blah-even the dessert!

Cocktail Shrimp - really tiny shrimp
Meatloaf - no taste
Steak - hard and rubbery
Apple Pie - yuck
Pumpkin Pie - double yuck
Mashed Potatoes - very bland

Well, you get the picture.  

If you have a voucher for a free meal at the buffet, get the fried chicken, I don't know what else to tell ya.Not much to say about this place other than it's a place to sleep. It seems pretty rundown. I did like the layout of the rooms having the bedroom separate from the living room area. The beds are hard as a rock and the pillows are pretty poor too. The toilet and seat were both loose. I needed a wheelchair accessible room (didn't get one) and although I could get to most of the areas the space to get through to the kitchen unit was way too small. The cable tv constantly froze making it impossible to watch anything. The only food they offered was pizza, which would compare to something from 7-11...edible only. Also there is 3 pools and the main pool which looked nice had private parties booked at least 2 days in a row. The middle pool looked dirty and didn't even bother checking out the third. We won't be staying again. I can say we had 2 nights booked and they allowed us to cancel the 2nd night, so there's that. Time will tell if we actually get refunded the 2nd night though.After seeing this on DDD with Guy Fieri, I had to check it out. It's in a grocery store strip mall, almost hidden from view. Inside, it's a typical hole in the wall fast casual place. You order at the counter and sit down until they call your number. 

Although it may not be impressive in appearance or from the outside, the food is absolutely amazing. Some of the best Mexican food I've ever had.

I had their signature Bombero burrito. It had carne asada, beans, and veggies, with a nice hot sauce on the outside. The carne asada was so lean and melted in my mouth. It was extremely spicy, which I love. The tortillas are homemade, and you can certainly taste the quality they put into their product. I also had homemade chips and their excellent salad with my burrito. And it's also served with some of the best refried beans north of the border.

Guy Fieri definitely nailed it by featuring this place on his show!!!Came here with a group of 4 on a busy Saturday night.  Looks like they were understaffed when we had to wait longer than 45 min for water.  

Missing one order, still no water.  

I tried the new coconut ice cream with my crepe. It was delicious and presentation is always great.just got home from this place..not bad but not great either..wife and I ordered the clam and mussels app and it cost like $11.00..No joke we got 12 total clams and mussels..very disappointed about that..wife got the Lobster Ravioli special..mostly cheese in them..hardly tasted any lobster what so ever..another disappointment..i got the veal gorgonzola,,not bad at all..veal was a little over cooked but eatable..I will say the waitress was very nice and knew her stuff..she got her 20% tip..thank goodness for the Groupon I had,,the meal was not worth the total price..We will not be returning there..SorryThe guy at billing was quite rude. They closed serving with a reason of food is yet to come. That tells me the dont make food at this place and serve ready made food. 
Just a tip to them Dont be rude to atleast old ladies have some decencyReally hard working crew!
Great food that hits the spot!Tried this place out a couple times, I felt the whole pizza experience was just alright . The build-your-own concept is quite a trend lately with pizza joints poppin up all over the valley. So we were happy to see one in this area. 

For the record: the first visit was the days before their grand opening and my pizza was complimentary for visitors during that day only. Second, and subsequent visits were a week after their grand opening.

--the Za
I didn't care for the dough they use. Bland, texture real dry and well frankly reminded me of cheap frozen pizza crust. Not enough selection of veggie toppings for me.  And unless you ask for more of one topping, they kind of skimp on servings of each topping.. Not their fault though. You are in control of building your pizza, so just ask!

Disappointed in the artisanal cheeses offered.  No fresh mozz?  Only shredded.  No goat cheese.. boo. 

The sauces were just ok as well. Prices under ten bucks are in ballpark with other places, but portion size is smaller.  Nothing stood out to differentiate themselves from their competitors other than they are the only fast \/casual byo in the area, but that is about to change. 

Service was friendly, the dining area is small but there are additional tables outdoors.  This place is perfect for employees working in the area to a grab a quick decent lunch.Tried this place for the second time.  Very quality burger, for the people who say in-n-out is better they must be crazy.  I am a fan of in-n-out but my first impression both times is that this is a very high end burger chain style burger i.e. no ordering medium rare, etc.  It beats in-n-out bar none.  Very high quality burger.Great place to come for kiddos to play! Love their half off days too ;) 
Place itself is huge compared to other indoor playgrounds. They have great verity of slides and other activities. 
Their cafe is pretty good too. Lots of options to choose from weather you are hungry or thirsty. 
Love coming here with my 3 year old!I won't bother with the specifics because pretty much everything was wrong. Every single time I go to this place, the order is wrong and poorly made, that's IF their "system isn't down." This is hands down the worst fast food restaurant in the region and I would be ashamed if I were responsible for it.We had to make dinner reservations almost 2 weeks in advance in order to secure a table for 8 and even then we only had 2 time slots available - 5pm or 9pm... Neither which are favorable. 

Food was good for AYCE standards and our waitress was nice. Love their daily special (sushi platter) and they had a good selection of food you don't see elsewhere (e.g torched sushi and the rectangular block sushi). 

In terms of pricing, it's above average for AYCE but good value considering what you're getting. We would come back again.Beautiful little restaurant, warm antique decor, friendly staff, delicious food and coffee... great find for an intimate dinner night!I love Charleston's. My experience has shown that everything they make tastes good. It's a great choice for a date because the atmosphere is a kind of darker and intimate. The food quality is a clear step above a place like Outback or Texas roadhouse, but it won't totally bust the bank.Consistent food, fun vibe, great addition to the neighborhood! I've eaten here
A few times (dinner mostly) and have never had a bad experience. Wide variety of seating\/ambiance options and a knowledgeable staff.Real Chicago-style deep dish pizza.  I spent a long time in Chicago and had been to the usual staples - Giordano's, Gino's East, and Pizzeria Uno, but never Lou Malnati's.  The taste is authentic and delicious.  My only criticism was that the crust was a bit tough (like hard to cut with a knife hard)I was here on the 1st official night they were open (not the soft opening or the VIP party).  I have to say, I was impressed at how smoothly everything seemed to be running.  I didn't get to see the entire restaurant, but what I did see was really cool.  I sat at the 1st bar when you walk in the place.  The stool was really uncomfortable - there needs to be a footrest ON the stool, not just under the counter.  The server\/bartenders who assisted me were very friendly and seemed genuinely excited about the products they were serving.  They have a good beer selection, something that is just now starting to happen more often in Vegas.  The bartender told  me that it is very important to them, the company started in PHX, who has a great beer scene.  The drink prices were a little high, but that is to be expected for the location.  I had the "cheap house salad" and the pretzels with fondue.  Both only took a few minutes before they were delivered.  And both were really delicious.  The salad comes standard with ranch dressing, and was tossed perfectly (not too much or too little dressing).  There were tomatoes and onions chopped up in it, along with some other stuff.  Now, the pretzels were AMAZING and totally worth comnig back for.  I don't know how they do it, but the cheese fondue that is served with them is absolutely orgasmic.  The pretzels are great for sharing, and are served in a paper lined dish.  The fondue comes in a small, individual pot with a candle underneath.  They were seriously SO good.

The menu is really diverse and there are so many different areas of the place, I think that there is something for everyone.  There is also a patio that looks down into the pool, so there is definitely some good people watching to be had here.  :)  I can't wait to go back and try some of their entress (and of course get more pretzels).  Everyone was so friendly and I really like the concept of the place.  Hopefully they are around for awhile, I hear they have quite a following in Phoenix.Meh.  Was hoping for a little more, but it was meh.  The soup needed to be spiced with more care - it was pretty bland.  The noodles were well pulled but my curtain noodles needed to boil about .30 seconds longer.

Prepared salads:  don't.  The taofu pi was stuck together like glue - definitely not made the same day ...

THe lamb skewer - meh.  Asked for it to be mah-lah (very hot) and it was barely a tickle on my tongue.  Adequate.  What this place is lacking is a little soul and authenticity ...Great time, great food. My server Maddie was great and I like the birdsOh my god! Customer service is the greatest! Cocktel De Elote is a MUST! Literally the best thing I've eaten in a while. They're very pet friendly too!Really good wood fired pizza oven creates the best pizza! Grab a pizza and drink between 4-6PM great happy hour deal. Beautiful bar and restaurant and friendly staff.This is my breakfast joint. Yea it can get crowded and the service can get a little lost in the weeds but they are nice folks and they apologize. Just have another coffee & surf on your phone and before you know it a great breakfast will arrive. My hash special was indeed special with nice chunks of corned beef and my over easy eggs were cooked perfectly. Nice folks, great breakfast, oh and really good coffee. Be prepared to wait a bit on a Sunday AM....Small place, but very modern looking and clean inside.  Some of the freshest tasting sushi I have had rivaling more expensive places (Parallax in Tremont and Pacific East in Coventry).

I always test sushi quality by ordering a rainbow roll at restaurants, this way they can't cover up old\/non-fresh ingredients with loads of mayo\/tempura.  The fish here (tuna, salmon, snapper) has a fresh non-fish nutty taste which is very good.

Their appetizers are also very tasty and fresh.

Lastly, the staff is very friendly, welcoming and never forgets to come by and check to see if you need anything else.

Great place, I would definitely check them out.For the most part they do tend to have better customer service than other fast foods. I have gone in several occasions and most of the time I have gotten good customer service. Although, I did not give them a 5\/5 stars for a few reasons: on weekends the drive thru lines are outrages ( should have more employees working) but I waited like minimum of 20 mins last time for just a number 1 on the menu! Also, I always get my burger well done and I always get it done medium when I asked for well done. Overall, it's good place and higher quality of service for a fast food.Back for part two  this pictured here is the best Pho and the best #SatayPho to be had  I almost have to say 'of all time'  actually IT IS.  Experience the most satisfaction & enjoy the time of your life in a bowl of pure liquid love. .  I can't get enough.lets get serious here. you don't come for the Japanese stuff.... you come here for the sashimi flounder fish (Korean style) it comes with that salty sauce you dip it in. i don't know what it is or what its called but its thick and red and ive seen it before at Korean bbq. i think it has soy bean paste in it. its delicious and its one of those versatile sauces that can be used on many different foods. i heard they also serve the sashimi style octopus here which i will have to get next time. sashimi flounder and soju is the bomb. this place is a must if you can handle a different way of eating sashimiThey now have an amazing deal on dinner and a movie.  14$ for drink, movie pass and a small steak, chicken or veg burrito.  I have one hell of an appetite, trust me when I tell you a small will do you fine!  Best of all you don't have to use the movie pass right away, so no worries on sleeping through your film in a full belly, burrito enduced coma.

You can load your burrito up with an amazing selection of fresh ingredients with burritos being made right in front of you.  When they ask you how hot, if you like spicy go for the 5 drops of the housemade hot sauce. Beware the one server who squirts a whole line, you will know her by her eyeliner!  If she's making your burrito you better drop into sobeys on the way home and invest in a gallon of milk to help you get it down.

Super healthy and crazy flavourful dinner. My only suggestion would be to include a fish option that isn't breaded and deep fried. 

This takeout spot is always busy and yet to disappoint.  Hard to find parking in the tiny lot out front, try to park up the street on the east side of the mini mall.Probably the lousiest chicken & service I have had in a while.  The hot sauce is straight from the bottle with all heat & no flavor.Great pizza, wonderful atmosphere and friendly staff. Their hot honey is the die for, the owner gave us a bottle of it, we put it on everything! He is amazing. So glad they do take out, because this has become our friday night staple dinner!Great service and atmosphere. Even better food and drinks. Definitely moving to the top of my list when it comes to the camelback corridor.

Recommendation: Don't miss out on the smoked salmon, its awesome!Great variety of poutine... But depending on time of day and which chef is there the crispiness of the fries are not always the same...Easily my favorite restaurant whether I'm dining in or ordering takeout through Uber eats. Food is always the best quality when it comes out. Be sure to try all the momo's and the chili chicken with steamed ting mo bun. The hot and sour soup is also the best I've had in the city. Highly recommend this place and the owner Garab and his team always give great service. Get here!!!maybe even better than archi's? i'll have to try a few more dishes, but damn it's yummy!

the restaurant is new so there are some kinks they are working out. but overall the food was tasty. maybe my favorite thai place in vegas so far.Wow. Just visiting from seattle area. And heard bout controversy with Gordon Ramsey( have never watched the show). 4 of us 
1. I order Caesar salad( had prosciutto, egg , a good Parmesan , anchovy, white truffle Caesar dressing and I ordered Side order of sautéed chicken breast( I wanted more protein on my diet.  It was fresh and delicious ... This coming from a gal who usually drenches my salad in Caesar dressing ... This salad was crisp lettuce and a light dressing FULL of great tastes. I would add bites of the chicken as I ate my salad
2. My husband ordered a fresh greens salad with lemon dill dressing which came out ahead of our meals. I took bites of that since it was huge and the yellow and red cherry tomatoes really made the dressing stand out. Very tasty .. He also had chicken fettuccine Alfredo and I tasted the sauce ... Wow best ever
3.  She had pear salad and she said it had the pears all throughout salad not just on top. Very good dressing.
4.   He had fettuccine Alfredo without chicken and he raved about it. 
The older white hair man did a lot of running around and checking in with us ....  We all thought this was excellent food and we are all seniors so we have had our share of excellent meals. 
Oh the other couple shared a crime brûlée and we already talk about a another visit soon before we leave ... I just need to decide between the desserts or my hubby's Alfredo for my next dinner!!! Sure was a great meal. Either something changed from GR opinion or he was nuts!This is hard, for value I'd easily give this 4 stars plus (at 17.99 the food is excellent), great variety, and it's really really good. 

But, it's not Caesar's, but hey it's less than half the price. I think Caesar's and Orleans would be my 1\/2 go tos in that order. You should try both. 

I'd rate it at 3 1\/2 stars.Seated immediately at almost 6pm on a Friday...our lucky day! The hostess is always bubbly and welcoming. Our waitress was quiet and I hated to keep asking her to repeat herself but she was friendly at least.

Hubby, sons and I shared fried pickles. A tad salty for our liking, but they were ok. 

"Sam I Am" was my burger of choice. A generous ground beef patty cooked to perfection, an egg fried hard (per my request), a ridiculous portion of ham, American cheese and pesto made for a meal that left me stuffed. I could not finish my tater tots although they were very tasty. 

Hubby had the Bacon Cheeseburger on Steroids. Need I say more? 3 pieces of jalapeño bacon and 3 pieces of applewood smoked bacon! He thoroughly enjoyed it!We lucked out and got a seat at the bar.  Drinks were fantastic.  Service was great.  And the food!!!  My husband loved his steak.  This place is great and will definitely come backSuch a great casual atmosphere in the dining area: well lit but cozy; large but intimate. The shakshuka was really delicious and big enough for a very hungry person. Seems like it would be good for groups. 

Will say though that we had to wait unnecessarily when 6 tables were open due to a bit of a disorganized host system.Love me some In n Out...so, I live in a state devoid of this great burger establishment so I always enjoy an opportunity to stop in and blow my calorie consumption for the day.

Upside is consistency, customer service, freshness and fun...love it animal style. Onions by request but plenty which I love...

It can often be a bit sketchy to find a seat but be patient, generally by the time your food is ready someone has finished and moved on.Pretty decent spot. The staff is very attentive and have issue being ready and available for you. If you ever come here make sure you try the blackberry drink. It was amazing.drinks are good .. just a little pricey . wouldn't recommend going regularly . drinks take long to come out .. boba is really wateryI came here for a cocktail before dinner. I liked the atmosphere, music and bartenders were good. 
I left to have dinner at another location. I think I should have just stayed at Merchant Madison for dinner. 
After dinner, I went back for an after dinner drink. Perfect.

Next time, I'll try the food.I think Stephanie C said it best -- atmosphere and alcohol are pretty much all Johnny Mango has to recommend itself.  I've had the big plate with something meaty and the pad thai and both were borderline inedible.  The food is simultaneously bland, salty, dry, mushy, and pricey with cheap ingredients.  Don't eat here. 

That said, the reason I didn't give it 2 stars is that it has a fun vibe and it's situated on a lovely corner in Ohio City.  On a nice day, it's tough to beat a table outside Johnny Mangos with friends and ordering round after round in one of very cool very cute pockets of a neighborhood.  

Oh -- and they have HAPPY HOUR: M-F 4-7pm 1\/2 off beer and wine and $2 off all other drinks.First, I have to give them props for accommodating our group that started with about 10 people, but grew to 20.  

Located in the Hard Rock hotel casino, our group decided to eat together and Goose Island pushed tables together for our large group. Good beer selection, limited wine, but full bar. 

Servers had quite a time trying to keep up with the drinks. Our server seemed overwhelmed, but others stepped in to help. 

As for food, they make it somewhere else and carry it to the restaurant. 

Spicy Italian sandwich? Average and bread didn't taste fresh
Buffalo fries? Soggy and covered in sauce
Antipasto salad? Good and huge (I shared)

We had a great time time, but given the size of our party, food was subpar and servers seemed a bit grouchy.First let me express my surprise with the otherwise glowing reviews of this Yorkville disappointment.  I have to disagree, but first some disclaimers.

1) My review is based on my first and only time eating here.
2) I only had a light meal and was in a bit of a rush.
3) I spent a couple of years in Japan, and may have 'unrealistic' expectations for this type of cuisine...

Disclaimers aside, the restaurant was woefully understaffed on a Wednesday evening just after 8 p.m. You would think two waitresses would be enough for this smallish room, but my girlfriend waited five minutes at the door to even get seated, and we both waited longer to get a drink order in.

The waitress was smiley, and her kimono was cute enough, but maybe it was what was slowing her down? She also brought one tea, when two were ordered, and I had to call her back on behalf of a neighbouring table who were having no luck doing it themselves.

Poor service can almost always be overcome by good eats, but alas, it was not to be. The sushi combo "B" was a tray with six california rolls and about six or seven nigiri. The rolls were poorly made -- actually the worst I've seen in a restaurant. The maki were loose, and the rice seemed dry, which made them crumble in my chopsticks. They were also sliced sloppily, with long odds and ends of avocado and cucumber sticking out.

The nigiri were a mixed bag. The hamachi was buttery and tasty, but the hokkigai (surf-clam) was rubbery and the salmon was listless. This was also the first time I have been given a clump of rice with an entire piece of faux-crab on it as a nigiri. I didn't even eat that one.

Perhaps worse than the sushi was the "fried tofu" which I took to be an attempt at agedashi tofu. Maybe I shouldn't compare it to that dish, since the name was different, but it looked similar. Well, similar enough. The small triangular tofu pieces were swimming in a soupy sauce -- way more than you would normally get in agedashi. And when I tucked in I found the soup to be very sour, almost just like vinegar. The tofu itself also had a slightly sour taste.

Miso soup was nothing special, but OK. The little run-of-the-mill salad that came with the sushi set might have been the best part of the meal, as it had a half-decent ginger dressing.

After all that the price was a shocker too. For one person The bill was nearly $30, including one bottle of Sapporo. Ouchie.

True, there were signed photos of stars like Richard Gere, Lucy Liu and Michael Ignatieff (does he qualify?). But after eating here, I think this restaurant trades much more on it's location than it does on the quality of the dining experience.

Cheap but acceptable sushi is kind of a Toronto staple these days. Unfortunately, on the night I ate here, Shogun had neither.Gourmet casual dining is how Provo brands itself and that's exactly what it is plus soooooo much more. Superior food, amazing beverage menu and most importantly exceptional service!!!! Definitely a hidden gem! You can't help but leave full and satisfied (and I'm picky). Looking forward to my next visit to try more of Provo's menu!Food and service is absolutely top notch- Great for business dinners or special occasions. I went to Del Frisco's for a business dinner, now I have to take the wife back. Pricey but worth it when you feel like splurging a bit-So I took my wife for our anniversary and I was pleasantly surprised. The service was among the best I have ever had and the overall experience was a great one. 

 The food is definitely overpriced and is decent but not great. The view of the Vegas city from above kind of makes up for that. This is a really romantic place especially if you go later in the evening during sunset time. I would recommend this place mainly because of the atmosphere, great service, and the view but not because of the food.2.5 - I do like the decor! Decor is Busy, detailed and rustic looking, transports you elsewhere. 
Friendly staff.
Interesting concept when they describe it but really its just make your own tacos. 
Tastey but nothing really stood out to me. Weird how they give you such minimal amounts of rice and beans. Nice soft taco but I rather have the dish (I had the shrimp and my bf had the lamb) with just the sauce mixed with rice and beans. We did ask for more rice. Minimal cilantro. A bit confused when they brought out the hard tacos and hot sauces. Was it an app or was it to go with our dish? We did both. 

Since it is make your own tacos we had sooo many dishes on the table. The tables are super duper small - we had to put some dishes and the water bottle on other surrounding tables (I cannot imagine where to put stuff if the resto was packed). 

A bit more $ than you expect to DIY your own tacos, unless you like paying for that experience.I've been wanting to try this place forever, but I'm not sure why other than yelpers seem to love it and it is close to the house.  However, let me disclose that there is few BBQ restaurants I've been to that I really have loved, so you may not want to listen to me if Lucille's is your bag.

I hadn't eaten anything the day I went here, and a plate of filling BBQ sounded good to me.  I wanted to try a few things so I got a combo plate with baby back ribs and the beef ribs.  I knew it would be too much food but I figured I could take home what I didn't eat.  For sides, I had corn and cole slaw for a tiny bit of vegetables.  My husband and I tried the onion strings and he had the pulled pork.

I found the onion strings to lack any sort of discernible onion flavor, which is what I like in onion ring type dishes.  It was too much focus on breading, not enough on the sweet onion.  However, my husband, who isn't into onion rings, really loved this dish.

The main dishes were okay, nothing I haven't made at home much better.  The baby backs were not that tender, but I thought the flavor was good, and I love the vinegar based sauce they have.  They were disappointing a little, but compared to another restaurant in the area, like Memphis Championship BBQ, they were a lot better.  But the beef ribs were a big disappointment, as if they managed to burn them and make them kind of "charred," but not in a good way.  I felt like I was just eating burned crunchy flesh and couldn't get through more than one rib.  My husband liked his pulled pork but it wasn't anything he hasn't had better before.

What really impressed us was they have some of their own "Lucille's beers," that included a Hefeweizen, which was delicious!  While our dinner wasn't impressive, we would come back for this  and the wonderful unsweetened iced teas.  So we're more than excited to do Happy Hour here, but I'm not sure we'll come back for a normal dinner.Great place to come and enjoy food, watch some games (tv's aren't that big but there are a lot of them), and hang out with friends.

I sat at the bar where i waited for one of my friends to arrive. Like always the bartenders are nice, trying to work for their tips (can't blame them).  I was promptly asked if i needed a drink and a menu. Of course i accepted. She came back quickly to ask if i was ready to order. I explained that my friend was coming and i was going to wait to order food.

No complaints so far, great service.

My friend comes he gets his drink order promptly and looks at the menu, i finish my first drink and they come by and get me another. Woah standard bar treatment. who would have thought.

Okay anyways thats pretty much the last we heard of the bartenders unless we flagged them down (and i hate doing that cause i feel like a jerk). Anyways we flagged them down for our food order, more drinks, water, and the bill.

They would have gotten a solid 4 stars. The service fell short in the end on my experience was a 3 star. 

The food was great i got the chicken sandwich... it was HUGE, i recommend it. Beer batter fries were maybe some of the best i have tasted. For real i will come back and i hope to upgrade them to a four star...unless the service is the same then it will be 3.PHOnomenal! Best pho in the valley! Their chili sauce cannot be beat and they really don't skimp on the veggies in the veggie pho. The atmosphere is great- they NEVER play stupid music, it's clean, energetic and really makes you feel good. I PHOfucking love this place!What exactly happened to my big fat Greek? Not only did the name change!Now it's called Opa Life. I ordered the same as usual Mediterranean chicken salad and it was a disaster! They literally put it on a soggy paper plate and didn't give me dressing nor pitas. The staff had no clue what's going on and it's still $9 plus tax and the fries were under done because they are rushing . It used to be my favorite.A new foodie friend of mine turned me on to this restaurant and I definitely wasn't disappointed. Went for dinner and started off by ordering a wild mushroom risotto with oven dried tomatoes and parmesan froth complemented with a Hitichino Nest white ale. Whenever I see Hitichino Nest on the menu I know I'm in the right place... Risotto was cooked perfect, slightly al-dente with nice earthy tones from the mushrooms and a light zing from the parmesan.

I sat at the chefs table so as I waited for the entree Chef Cole threw together a flat bread with caramelized onions and olives with a bit of roasted peppers that had a nice heat to every bite.

I ordered a Chimay to go with my open-faced pot roast sandwich with broccolini and caramelized carrots. Pot roast was nice and savory served over a thick slab of texas toast.  Taste was predictable until the caramelized carrots took over and pulled the flavors into another direction.

Forbidden rice became my dessert for the night. Simple light dish of rice and vegetables.  A must when you visit...It is a good spot at the MGM. The fried chicken sandwich was good. The brioche bun was great. The sweet patio fries were great too.Just stopped at Station for happy hour before dinner. Drinks are delicious and affordable, service is WONDERFUL and the decor is industrial and stylish, definitely paying homage to Pittsburgh history. And the outdoor seating is a huge bonus. Will surely be back!This is THE place to go. Went with my family for lunch after we visited the hoover dam and it was the best decision we have made. You can sit inside or outside. They have happy hour from 3-6 and live music starting at 6. Potato skin was AMAZING!! Was a big worried at first but it ended up being super good. Definitely the place to go!!! 10\/10In the middle of the afternoon, too early for dinner, too late for lunch, this is the best place to go, a different world not only in regards to the interior design seemingly going back in time, but also in regards to the taste buds which are going to be spoiled quite a bit. A seducing selection of pastries but also a la carte sandwiches etc let you indulge.Maybe i was just really hungry. The food was delish and very satisfying! Good service, too. :)Unfortunately overpriced for the quality of the food. I feel like you could have the same items at another restaurant that is less stuffy and old-school than this place.If I could have given Brand Steakhouse ZERO STARS I would have. 

My girlfriends and I were in Vegas this past weekend (memorial 2009) and we were looking for a good steak. What we got was incredibly disappointing. 

From the service to the food the whole meal was a nightmare. Our waitress could not keep a single order straight and when she delivered our drinks (each one to the wrong person I might add) she said, and I quote, "this is what we do when one gets the wrong drink" and she slide my drink from in front of my friend across the table to me. And that was just the beginning. I heard every excuse in the book from the runners being new to them being super busy... there were maybe 4 other parties in the whole restaurant. 

The food was sub par at best. I order the 9oz. Filet Mignon and what I got was a fatty piece of beef that I could not identify. In addition, the potato pancakes were a greasy gooey mess dripping with oil... YUCK!! 

Take my advice skip this restaurant at all costs! Instead go to N9ne Steakhouse at the Palms. If you are stuck at the Monte Carlo and need to eat there you will not go wrong with Diablos. The food is delicious and the wait staff are wonderfulFree with my room I made the all day buffet my bitch by eating my weight in crab legs... 


It's not the Wynn buffett, but seriously, what is?  It also doesn't cost as much.  I wouldn't go out of your way to eat here, but if you get a deal and aren't expecting haute cuisine, it's not terrible.I've come here multiple times and loved this place. The last two times I've come there has been a hair in my food. I thought maybe it was just a one time thing so we came back again, there was a hair in not one but TWO things I ordered. In our appetizer and my margarita. I am completely turned off from this place I can't say I will be back.I came in a little later after the lunch rush, sides were running a little low. Ordered the buttered chicken panini and to my surprise it was not bad! Could use some more flavour though. Don't bother ordering the smoothie, fruits are frozen and they put only one scoop of yogurt.My absolute go-to bubble tea spot. They were the first, and they are the best. Variety of flavors and sizes, and the tapioca pearls are soft but not mushy. Just the right amount of bounce! They do not have the tendency to be occasionally hard and undercooked like other tea places. I usually get the Jasmine green tea, no milk, with tapioca. It isn't as sweet as some of the flavored teas and there is a fresh jasmine tea flavor. Flavored milk teas are excellent but more like a dessert drink than an iced tea. 

I was waiting until I tried their food to review them, and that was fantastic too! I ordered the tofu with chinese pepper. Had a really wonderful taste! Not too oily or too spicy. Perfectly seasoned. Tofu was chewy with crunchy exterior. It was really excellent. I can't wait to try more food from here!Great food- and service! Very attentive with hardly no wait at all. I had a burrito bowl with shredded beef and a margarita. My bf had the lunch special: taco, enchilada and tostada. We are both happy and full!Ordering the prime rib sandwich has always been great. This time BOTH of the sandwiches were far below par. I asked for rare & lean. They both came in little pieces ( like it was the end & they didn't care what was in the sandwiches because it was a delivery ) & well done. Sadly we will not be ordering from them again anytime soon. Also our guest orders the fried chicken which literally had no taste , ( except for the breading ) & was dry. Her mashed potatoes were loaded w butter. Totally gross. The carrot cake was old. Only good part of meal was the key lime pie. 
Please dm me if you like since in your contact info there is no way to reach me?!! You left me a link that is for all your restaurants, not one to reach you. Good try though !We try to stay at a new hotel every year when we go to Vegas so this year was Cosmo. When we arrived, concierge came to grab our bags and told us just to call when we got into our room and they would be right up with our bags. We got our room immediately and were in a hurry to get to a dinner reservation. We called concierge to bring our bags up and they said it'd be a 30 minute wait! So then we had to go back downstairs to wait in line to get our bags.... annoying way to start our trip.

Our room was updated and looked clean. When we booked it said we would have a fridge.... the fridge was completely full with products you have to pay for so I had no place to put my cold food that I brought with me. I called the front desk to complain and they brought up a fridge at no charge. Still... very annoying way to start our trip. 

The rest of our stay at Cosmo was great! Everyone that worked there was very friendly and helpful. The bed was comfy. Room was clean. Great location on the strip. Great restaurants. Amazing views from the pool. My only other complaint is that the room wasn't very noice proof. Many of the other hotels we've stayed at in Vegas have blocked the noise well. We could hear the people next door talking even though they weren't talking very loud. Surprising since this is a newer hotel.Great place to shop, they have sugar free salad dressings & choc syrp. Hard to find items R here. Love itLoved it! I had this place on my list to visit before I left and luckily I came across it before departing. The food was excellent, Chef Dougan is an awesome person, and I'll definitely be back there on my next trip. 

I ordered zucchini pasta with spinach and mushrooms along with the cashew alfredo sauce. The dish was plentiful and delicious.We went to Nikko's for the first time for a friends birthday this week and I have to say I was pretty impressed. It is a bit more upscale then some of the other trendy sushi joints around town, with an almost club like feel. Parking was easy as they had valet parking. Service was great and the food was wonderful. We started out with the toro tartare which to be honest wasnt the best toro Ive had but still pretty good. It did lack a little flavor for what you expect out of toro. The price was about $19 which I think is somewhat fair for a good amount of toro. Definately a bit more expensive than your usual appetizer though. The remaining entrees were fantastic. I got the a sushi\/ sashimi sampler plate for $30. it game with 3 pieces each sashimi octopus, salmon, and tuna and 8 pieces of nigiri including, shrimp, tuna, hamachi, salmon. It was definately tastey and for the price they did give big cuts of sashimi. The only thing I wish was different was the double tuna and salmon they give. I would of liked to try different fish on the nigiri. One of our friends had the volcano roll. It  may have been the best volcano roll I have tried. I believe it was around $13, which for higher end place is not a bad deal. My soon to be mother in law is in town from Detroit and she will not touch any sushi so she got the steak and chicken teriyaki hibachi. The steak was delicous. It was cooked to perfection and had great flavors. The cost was about $25 dollars. Which I think is comparable to any other Japanese restaurant. I did get a couple bottles of sake. I prefer unfiltered cold sake usually and they had a couple of different selections. It was rather good. I did notice that some of there sake was a bit over priced. I have seen the same sake at other restaurants for a fraction of the price. I would say this place is almost five stars. I have not been there enough to try more of their sushi rolls yet. I will definately go back sometime and maybe this review will be updated.Atmosphere is nice.  Made reservations right from the app and we went straight to our table.  We had a new waitress, but she wasn't bad.  We ordered and our sushi was out in probably 10 min!  Very fast for the amount we ordered.  The presentation and taste were both excellent.  All around a good sushi\/hibachiThis was the worst dairy I have been to in my life.
The grilled chicken salad was wilted, brown with unedible tomatoes and very little chicken and not tasty. My partner's turkey sandwich was average at best. the fries were good.I hadn't been here in ages - delicious food, great atmosphere and excellent service from Zach F..  He had great recommendations and was very attentive to my table's needs without being annoying.  I will definitely be back soon!!Decent Mexican place at the Waterfront. I have been to Gran Agave a few times, most recently this past weekend. The food is always satisfactory and I have never had to wait for a table. They seem to have all of the basics down, free chips and salsa, large menu, good margaritas and fresh ingredients. The guacamole is always tasty and the mole sauce is on point. The portions are large and filling. The chicken in the tacos and quesadillas taste like it has been slow roasted for several hours. My only criticism is the wait staff. On Saturday, our waiter was visibly unhappy and impatient. Also, another server spilled a tray full of drinks right behind my dining companion and did not apologize or ask if he got wet. All in all, go to Gran Agave for the food, not for the friendly service.Let me start this review off by saying... I'll be back, and most likely this will be what I consider a 5 star establishment.

This part of the review carries the opinion of only the people of 48 out of 50 states.  That being said, people from NY\/NJ are extremely opinionated, bordering on obnoxious, when it comes to discussing "pie."  We get it, you're impassioned, cut the crap, this is what we got for y'all down here. Take it or leave it....

But wait.. What's that? There's a pizza joint recommended by my Yankiest of Yankee friends... Guess what?  I never tried the pizza... just to be a jerk.  But it smelled\/looked amazing. 

No I had eaten pizza already that day, so instead I went with their Chicken Parm, my wife also went with pasta, we were both pleased with not only the dishes, but the service, the ambiance, how quick the food came out, everything.

Big point, to restaurant management everywhere, these guys are doing it right, walk around a few times throughout dinner service like you genuinely want to be there, welcome people, to your establishment, ask their opinions. You don't have to have long conversations with people, a little goes a long way.

I really suggest checking it out, this is a great neighborhood spot.I was definitely seeing a lot of red at the Red Martini!  I usually have a 3 strikes and you're out policy... If this were a baseball game, the Red Martini's winning streak would be in the negatives!

It was my high school English teacher's birthday and because she lives I'm the Durham Region we usually dine somewhere in Pickering or Ajax. It gets me out of Toronto once in awhile.  So I had made reservations for 7pm. When we arrived there were 2 occupied tables in the downstairs bar lounge.  We stood there for 5 minutes with no sign of any hostess or staff.  After what seemed like an eternal wait, the waitress appeared and she told us we could choose a table either upstairs or downstairs.  We opted for the upper level.

The Red Martini is a house-converted restaurant, similar to 22 Church Street Bistro across the street.  A co-worker told me that the 2 restaurant are owned by the same owner, however this is unconfirmed.  However I did spot a lot of similarities.

Once we chose our table, again we were left unattended and ignored for awhile. We quickly realized that the waitress who "greeted" us downstairs was the only staff in the front end for the entire restaurant. Strike 1 - understaffed.

My high school English teacher loves her white wine and she usually orders the house white.  Strike 2 - they were out of their house white.  This is a clear indication of poor restaurant management.  So we had no other choice than to order the next available white wine which was twice the cost.

We waited for our appetizer - no bread basket appeared - Strike 3 and you're out! 

We ordered and shared the Stuffed Portobello Mushroom Salad to start. This could've easily been THE best tasting salad I've ever had in my life. However, the minor neglect in detail made it second best.  The salad was a deconstructed-style salad. The grilled portobello mushrooms were delicious. The "stuffing" was made from imitation crab meat and eggs... So essentially it tasted like an egg salad.  It was also served with COLD naan bread... It would've been the perfect salad if they grilled the naan. We had requested that the appetizer come first and then our mains... However the server showed up 2 minutes into us digging into our salads, so we had to send her back to the kitchen and requested the food be kept warm.

My Coconut Tilapia was served with a spicy plum sauce, Bok Choy, red and yellow bell peppers and jasmine rice. When I first bit into the tilapia I was excited that the fish skin was so crisp... But I quickly realized that the crisp was not due to skillful culinary execution, but rather to a burnt fish... Parts of it were so burnt I started tasting charcoal!  Also, the "coconut" component of the dish was M.I.A.  This dish had so much potential.. *sigh*

I didn't try my teacher's Veggie Stir-Fry with Chicken but the feedback I got from her wad that the vegetables were cooked to a mush, and that the chicken was dry.  In their defense, the mush factor may have been a result of the dish being kept on a warming plate.

To finish we ordered a cappuccino, tea and marbled cheesecake.  The server came back up to inform me that they don't offer cappuccino... How do you not know that?  Its like she was a temp hired to tide over a quiet Sunday restaurant service.  So I settled for a coffee.  

The cheesecake was average, nothing spectacular.  

At the end of the day, the bill came to $105.  I will say that the portion sizes are generous and the food does have potential... However, the service aspect is going to need a complete facelift.  I had such high hopes for you Red Martini... I thought you'd be sizzling... But unfortunately the only thing that was red and sizzling about my experience at the Red Martini was my dress and the afterburn in my mouth from the spicy plum sauce!I was here with a group of people on a per-set menu. The decor was beautiful and service was superb. He wait staff was very attentive. 

I started without the lentil soup - it was ok. We were served like a salmon roumelade with the starter bread which was amazing. My salmon entree was cooked perfectly and my potatoes were tasty. Dessert included mini donuts, brownie bites, and macaroons. The donuts were my fave. 

It looks like they have an extensive seafood menu including raw oysters but we didn't get a chance to try it. I would definitely go back.Ordered the turkey burger with sweet pot fries and it was pretty good. Wanted to try them out and their spiked shakes because I got a shake on my last layover. For $7, I was impressed with the size. But I was not happy about the spiked shake. So much for wanting one. It cost more than my burger and fries. For $13.50, I need more shake and a little more alcohol. Don't get sucked in, proceed with caution.This place is a great bang for your buck! The portion is HUGE with a good ratio of meat\/veggies\/fries or rice\/pitas\/ greek yogurt. The food would be ordered from the register and brought to table when it's done. And it's done FAST considering how busy the restaurant was at the time we were there. 

I got Traditional Gyro plate and Hummus Pitas as appetizer. Hummus was REALLY creamy and it was not too salty which I loved. My sister also got a side of rice, which is so flavorful and has a hint of milky silky flavor to it. I was obsessed with it! 
However, the lamb didn't really live up to the rice. The meat was a bit on a dry side, which I'm not sure if it was how the dish was supposed to be. I like the flavor of the steak and chicken on my brother's and sister's plate better, so maybe next time I'll get that instead.We have never had a bad steak there until our last visit Jan 4 2015 we went for dinner my steak we very tough our server took it back they made me a new steak it was just as tough as the first one with lots of gristle. I'm not sure if they are getting there meat from but the quality is gone, I well probably never go back we spent 50.00 for the meal not including the $10.00 tip.Happy Hour is legit here.

I love any place in Olde Town that looks great and has a great crowd but it doesn't take a strippers pay check to hang out.  This is a place like that.

Went at happy hour for a friends birthday.  We ordered what seemed liked everything on the menu and everything was delish and nothing broke the bank.  Very pleased.

Im not a sushi snob in anyway as you can see I like almost every place I go to. However, do to the fact that they have great food, waitresses, great bathrooms, and a pic of Jimi Hendrix at the bar this place easily gets 4 stars.  Only reason I wont give it 5 is I have been here at night and the place has gotten too crowded and that gets annoying.

4 1\/2 starsThis location is extremely 'group friendly.'  I just made up that term, but it's true... I've been to this Z a handful of times with large groups and I've never been disappointed.  Maybe it's because it's a central location and they've got a private lot for parking... or perhaps it's because of those chambord margaritas? or is it the chips and salsa? or the cornbread?  Whatever the reason, I'm giving this Z a 4 star review because of previous good meals and for the excellent service we had tonight.

I called in the afternoon and had no problem getting a reservation.  Julie who answered the phone was really sweet (always a good sign), and Matt, our server, was extremely personable and attentive.  We had a group of 8 - including a few picky eaters.  We started with chips (which are house-made) and salsa, guacamole, and grilled shrimp & guacamole tostada bites... On top of that, the GM brought us over the beef tostadas and shrimp & pork dumplings - this was a very sweet gesture and much appreciated - we finished every last bite of both!  The dumplings were cooked to a golden brown and really tasty.  The beef tostadas were yummy also; I think these are both new menu items that are being tested - hopefully they will stay since they were both pretty impressive!

After sampling all of that, I still somehow managed to eat my dinner salad with a light lime vinagrette dressing; it was good but nothing special.  (Nothing like their Achiote Chicken Chopped Salad which is my favorite menu item to order when I go to Z for lunch)... And then my 'Grilled Miso Salmon' entree - actually, not as good as I remembered, but tasty nonetheless... other entrees at our table included the halibut special, blackened tuna, porcupine shrimp, seafood enchiladas, and a couple of entree salads.  Everyone was happy and left full - and for just over $30 a head including tip... not bad!

I'll be back to visit this Z again soon for sure... it's a safe bet no matter your reasons, and it's great for groups!  Word of caution: be careful with the chambord margaritas - they dangerously good!this place is legit. cheap beer by the pitcher. great deals during games. neighborhood vibe. black velvet painting of a sexy lady above the beer taps. worst thing about this place is the touchtunes- like i ever need to hear "you can't always get what you want" or any song by "the eagles" ever again but whatever. pretty lousy vegetarian options but it's fun and cheap. drunk bros playing darts makes me nervous but that's my problem.I really love this bakery and all of its freshly made and truly delicious offerings: breads, rolls, bagels, cakes, pastries, etc. If you'd like to save a bit of cash, the day-old items are often available at a discount.

When I used to live in the part of the Las Vegas metropolitan area where they are located, I was a regular weekly visitor at their original bakery (before the fire and rebuilding).

However, now having lived in the wild and woolly northwestern part of town for many years, I very rarely stop by anymore. It's simply too inconvenient to travel way down south - to the diagonally opposite end of the valley - for my freshly baked goodies when the in-store bakeries at all of the local Smith's supermarkets produce comparable items of consistently good quality (but not as good as Great Buns!).

I have often hoped that Great Buns might open a second bakery (or a satellite store of some kind) in my part of Las Vegas so that customers in this part of town could more conveniently get their fresh baked goods fix. 

Any chance of doing so?I've been going for 26 years and the recent changes to the menu are very good. Try the risotto dishes or the new seafood ravioli dish superb. I think that the price rating should be $$$ not $$Best coffee in Tempe hands down.

Cool little place too.

I used to work at a roaster and this place knows what's up.  Owner is a drummer too, so I like the place even better.Super cool brunch place! I met a friend down here because of the good reviews on Yelp. I ordered the Be Sammy with turkey which was pretty yummy with their mayo sauce and avocado. Seriously, anything with avocado makes me drool. They have a good selection of coffees, i.e. Drip, pour over, latte, etc. It was cute and small, sat at the long table with other random people which was just fine cuz everyone was really friendly. You can even walk a few steps around the corner and check out the art gallery. I think it's part of first Fridays as well. 

It's pretty hipster and you'll find a lot of different types of people here. Good food\/sandwich and coffee was on point. I also loved that we didn't have to wait an hour in line to get seated like a lot of brunch spots on a Saturday morning. I only gave it a 4star cuz it didn't have the biggest selection but I could definitely see myself coming back to grab a quick bite to eat.We were a large group so we had a separate section to ourselves.  The restaurant was more empty than I expected for such a terrific spot.  Even though the group was large, we were served well and despite lapses in service (slow to bring drinks etc.) it was an overall positive experience.  

The set menu was very nicely laid out and he salad was fresh and crisp with a lemon dressing.  We were served exceptional bruschetta which I must say was very refreshing and had little or no onion (my preference) so it was a big hit for me - and a great way to cleanse the palate...  The crab cakes were exceptional.  They were mostly crab and very little other stuff, so they tasted more of the sea and the crab itself rather than the stuffing.  Recommended highly!

The choice for me was Chilean sea bass and I must say it was cooked perfectly.  The meat was flaky and moist and the greens and vegetables surrounding it were crunchy - just how I like them.  Overall a delightful dish and highly recommended

I would love to go back.  The service speed and somewhat dryer ambiance make it a 4 for me.  Or maybe a 4.5.  I need to go back to check it out again.  

I recommend this spot!Crowded, rightfully so the breakfast was worth the wait. Grits with cinnamon n butter YUM. Get out from downtown n go here!This is a pretty typical premium outlet mall except that it's so hot your skin will melt off. (No seriously it will) It has all my favorite stores: Coach, A\/X, Kenneth Cole and Banana Republic. There are some good deals in here but a lot of stores only knock off about 20% which isn't much. Either way I always come here when I visit Vegas.Excellent food came last week and had to come back again food is delish. Had same waitress excellent serviceLoved our experience here! We ordered an assortment of food from the Benihana roll, to tempura avocado, to chicken fried rice. All delicious. Our 1 yr old decided to have a fit once we placed her in the high hair  the staff immediately came over and brought her a cute fruit tray carved out as a monkey and some sweet cookies. Staff was courteous and very attentive. We will definitely come back here.We decided to try something new, and this restaurant was awesome! Had such great gluten free options too. Our waitress Brandi made an extra
Effort to make sure my food was defiantly gluten free. She really cares about my allergy which made me feel safe! She was so friendly and made our time there worth while! Food was awesome too! If you like a little quick restaurant this is your place!Soooo good. We ordered the tamale, buffalo cauliflower wings, and their  daily special, "chicken" and waffles. 

Every dish was totally flavorful and delicious. Wish we had a place like this back where we live!One of my favourites in the area. I really like the rolls- have a huge selection and the rolls are quite large. Bulgogi and spicy chicken are also quite good. 

My favourite is the chefs roll and mountain roll. 

A really nice sushi spot.First of all, the food is good. However, I had the worst dining experience of my life here tonight. We purchased a Groupon worth $40 that we paid $22 for. We ordered the rolls which were 50% off. When the check came for about $75 we were told the coupon did not qualify. It was only good for the "all you can eat lunch." The coupon didn't specify lunch nor not applicable on any specials like the 50% off rolls. My position is they have $22 of my money already and they wouldn't even take that off the meal. I already paid that! I will NEVER EAT THERE AGAIN. I will tell my friends not to also and I have many friends. At the least they could have taken $22 off the bill and they wouldn't do that. POOR AS HELL CUSTOMER SERVICE. They will not stay in business with that attitude. Bye bye Sakura.OK, decent beer selection, but no local beer on tap?  Whats with that?Place has a nice ambience but can be rather claustrophobic, service is good somtimes, and absolutley terrible on other occasions. Some of the pasties are not as good as they sound and can be quite dry.  Be careful when ordering.  The original classic pasty is always a good bet. Good yet short happy hour & a creative atlternative to the average corner pub. Could be better, could be 5 stars!Burger was Dynamite and the rest of the menu looked great. Great craft beer selection that's always changing. Definitely would return.atmosphere is nice, service is good and the servers are very polite. Wine collection is amazing. They have American, Italian, and Spanish wine and their food is delicious. Just let you know that their entrée meal is limited. You may want to look at their menu.Wow...yummy!

I had wanted to try out Scarpetta having been a huge Chopped fan and knowing I was going to be staying next-door in the Bellagio. OpenTable didn't have a reservation available for that day and I thought I was out of luck. We happen to be at the Cosmopolitan anyways and went upstairs to do a drop in... luckily they had a table for two with a Fountain view and all!

I can't say enough good things about the breadbasket it was amazing. The caponata I could've eaten 10 bowls. 

But I wisely left some room for apps and the main. I had the beet and burrata salad. The dressing on the beets was tangy and the burrata very rich and smooth. It was also beautifully composed. My companion had the polenta. Which was just as sinfully creamy as they said it would be.

For main I had the bone marrow agnolotti. Rich little pillows of beefy heaven. And the breadcrumb crunch on top...perfect. And of course we had to try the famous spaghetti. There's a reason they're famous for it. Sauce clings to the noodles and transports you to Italy...get it.*4.5 STARS

If only there was more space here, or have a better way to handle line-ups, I would give this restaurant a full 5 stars.

My friends and I were planning to head to Lady Marmalade for brunch on Sunday, however, with the extensive line-up, we decided to come to Bonjour Brioche (found it on the yelp app).  

The line-up seemed shorter, however, unfortunately, I was waiting for another 45 minutes just to get a seat for 4.  I was getting hungry and cranky.  Joanne being hungry and cranky is not a fun sight.

We finally got seated, and I absolutely loved our waiter.  Fun, smart, and had an amazingly great memory.  I had ordered the special that day: poached eggs, smoked salmon, caramelized onions, on a croissant.  Goodness gracious, this was probably the best benny that I had (next to Vancouver's Teahouse).  The caramelized onions was a great touch.  The fresh pear\/ginger juice was okay as well, but I could have passed.

My friends had ordered the croque monsieur, and the smoked salmon & scrambled eggs.  They said that my poached eggs was a lot better (which I have to agree with).

For dessert, my girlfriends and I had ordered the flourless chocolate cake.  It was a bit too dense for my liking (and I'm not the biggest fan of chocolate-related pastries... Please don't kill me).  I would love to try the apple tarte tatin next time.  Too bad I was pregnant with a food baby at the end of the meal.We go there every year once or twice and every time it's amazing.  They serve steak, simply and fresh and over wood fire and it requires nothing else.
This place hasn't changed in 30 years nor should it, the food is great, the staff is excellent and the ambiance is superb!  If you visiting or a local come here before you try those overpriced others.Not gonna lie, the line sucks! But the food was good. The iced coffee was ehh... Let's just say I didn't even finish it and for me to not finish coffee is rare.You could eat at Spring Garden, or you could just pay the guy dropping off food from the Cisco truck $5 for a sample and save yourself the time.  There is nothing original or tasty about the Spring Garden menu.  The only positive thing I can say about them is that they participate in the community fund raisers.Always delicious. Always quick and great service. Only reason for 4 starts is the price of the food compared to the portion you receive. Love the brisket and pulled pork. I prefer the brisket but it's usually an upcharge.  The pork rolls are also delicious but they can fill you up and they are also a bit expensive.Some friends and I were searching for food late at night when we stumbled across this place. I ordered Kimchi Fries, not sure what to expect. They were fantastic, and better than any poutine I've ever had (sorry Canada). The staff were amazingly friendly and looked like they really enjoyed their job and chatting with customers. I'll be back.Stopped in on our way out of Charlotte and got coffee and a few sandwiches for our train ride home.  The caramel latte is exactly what I needed, so YUM!!!  We got a roast beef sandwich and a turkey\/brie sandwich.  While the sandwiches were good, I do think they are over priced.  Then again it is midtown so I didn't expect cheap...  We also got some of the candy lego blocks for our son, which he had a ball with (I know I can get these other places but because there was something there for him, made me happy).  We will be returning!From the outside it was hard to tell if this was a sit down restaurant or order at the counter. It was the order at the counter type which is what I was hoping for. They have many Mediterranean options and sides, apps, desserts to choose from. I got a chicken pita and side of roasted veggies. The chicken pita was delicious at first but then fell apart as the sautéed onions were too much for the pita to hold. It turned very messy very fast. But it was still delicious! As we're the roasted veggies on the side. I got the limeade they had at the counter not expecting it to be as sweet and sugary as lemonade, but it was just that. Should've stuck with water as I was trying to be more healthy. Anyways all in all it was very good food, just pretty messy.Their gourmet buffet is the best! A little pricey but definitely worth it! I think i paid like $60 that day and yep i was alone that time. Make sure that you are super hungry when you come here because you would like to try all of the dishes. Make sure to save some room for desert. They all look very pretty and well presented!I love fried chicken! So the moment I realized there was a new chicken and waffles place opening up - I was excited, yet skeptical. But, honestly, it lived up to my expectations of crispy skin and juicy meat. 

The menu has a ton of super cute puns... which is fun!

I recommend the Mother Clucker - 3 pieces of chicken with a cheddar jalapeno waffle, choice of side and dipping sauce. Twice I've gone, and twice I've gotten the house sauce and the spicy sauce. So so good.

The Cluck Yeah! Is also pretty awesome. Boneless skinless chicken breast, deep fried and sandwiched between cheddar jalapeno waffles, with coleslaw and chipotle aiole.  

And, yeah, I had dessert... The Clucking Lil' Waffies are like a waffle, a churro and a tiny tim donut all became one. Deep fried waffle sticks are dusted in brown sugar and cinnamon and served with nutella and maple syrup. 

Spoke to the owners and they buttermilk brine the chicken overnight and exclusively use broaster fryers so the chicken not only cooks quickly but perfectly every time.DOWNTOWN TONY

portobello mushroom sliders with vegetable slaw and sriracha aioli. served with togarashi fries and curry ketchup (house made!)

Buns were sooo fresh. Delicious sliders. Potato fries perfectly cooked with "curry ketchup" was not a strong flavor. Perfectly balanced and matched the fries well. 

I will come again.Dina's.....


Their decor is from the early 2000s (when they moved into their location, an old auto repair shop) and still remains clean with good lighting. 
I have to respect a sports bar that is loyal enough to still have the framed Tim Couch jersey on display. Multiple TVs and a wide array of bar stools at the bar and plenty of tables. There's darts and a touch-screen jukebox with only 3 [!!] Sublime songs.

The waitresses are nice and get your order right but they have not been very attentive on multiple occasions. I had considered ordering another drink from the bar but decided to wait on one occasion since my server was pregnant. I just realized after typing this that all of the employees I remember are female. 

Their domestic beer selection is quite large [I didn't even know there was a Rolling Rock Light...] and 2-3 microbrews. Last time I went, I was pretty surprised to find Magic Hat for $4 a pint. The $2 miller lite 22oz specials are tempting. 

Pizza. Pizzas are their signature dish and are made with a variety of toppings. I like mine with little grease, a lot of sauce, and just enough cheese to cover the sauce. Dina's pizza is too greasy for me (enough to put a napkin on the cheese side and have it soaked up) and all right overall. The end crust is thick and crunchy but never burned. I had their fish dinner on Friday night. Sure, the perch came out of a freezer and had generic breading (I had low expectations, so no loss) but it was a large portion with fries [large] and cole slaw for $7. 

This place is popular [I've never seen the place dead, even on a Tuesday night] but besides its close location to me, some of my friends' tendency to stick to what they know and like, and average prices, I don't have a strong feeling to particularly come back or any reason that makes it stand out from other bar\/grills.Sampling plates are awesome. Veggie platter is a great way to try multiple dishes. The service was fantastic as well.Ordered a medium Deno's Special and 20 BBQ wings, both were fantastic. Decided to take them home (A\/C must have been out) the place is very small only four tables, very sparsely decorated and sterile.  Incredible place for takeout! 

The food is great and with some table cloths, candlelight, and vino (no alcohol, so BYOB) this place could be that amazing hidden treasures you talk about for years.Food is fine, but just overheard the owner tell a customer, and I quote "I hate the way you fucking order." When the customer, who had ordered their food in a normal manner, asked how the owner could say that to him the owner continued to be belligerent. He said the customer "ordered like an idiot". I've never seen anything like it and I'll never go back there again. Incredibly rude.The food there is not bad, I almost order it everyday. Everyone working there are polite except one.
This girl is brown hair with highlights who normally stands at cash table in the morning. I have observed that she never smiles at customers. (The only time I have ever seen her smile is when she is with her co-workers). Instead of saying 'thank you' and 'please', she always give us a cold face with saying 'go ahead'! It is not at all courteous to greet customers like that.
The last time I ordered hot chocolate with whip cream on top, and I told her twice, but she still forgot to tell the person who made it for me. I waited there for about 10 minutes, I know they are busy in the morning that I can totally understand. But when I got my hot chocolate and it wasn't what I wanted. I asked her but she didn't apologize, not even a 'sorry'. This kind of service and attitude to customers is entirely unacceptable, and perhaps bad for business too.. If you could kindly look into this situation and make mornings better for all of us, that would be much appreciated!!! Thank you for taking the time to read this.Tried a little bit of a lot of things. It was all so good. The carne asada was awesome and the favorito de elianas was sooo good!! Restaurant was super clean and the owners were very friendly. Definitely going back.Honestly, I rarely ate Rosati's when I lived in Chicago. It wasn't even close to being in my top 5.  However, having lived in Vegas for 15 years now, my options are limited---especially to what's close to me.  

With that, I'm happy Rosati's is here.  I still find their pie to be a bit salty (I think their double dough is better), but it is a way better option than most everything here.  Also, the Italian Beef is better than Al's, but not as good as Sonio's.Always good, always consistent!  Quality meats and cheese.  Just the right amount of grease!  The only local pizza that is not disappointing that delivers to Highland Park.  

Try the white pizza too.  Yum!

Wish they were open later on the weekends for late night pizza, but it's probably better this way (for my health and figure).Well it seems fun as long as you speak Vietnamese er Korean er uh um "Asian." Has a big TV, karaoke and guys play some weird checkers game out front all day. Owner is a young woman who knows no English but is nice.Worth every penny!! The best buffet!! They have a variety! The steamed crab legs are sooo good and to top it off the desserts are awesome!!! The crepes station! Mmmmm. You should try the Nutella crepesI come to crab corner on a regular basis. The soft she'll crab and crab cakes eggs Benedict is amazing. The service form Ashley the bar tender is superb my drink is always filled and she is always attentive to her guests. The service here is one of the main reasons I keep coming get backStopped by Ron's today to try it for the first time after reading all the great reviews and it did not disappoint at all!!  The food is very good!  The seating area is kinda small but I took mine to go anyway. Fresh food and great flavors. Small market attached with a wonderful variety to choose from.  
Prices are very reasonable as well.  
I recommend, this is a must try!!We had lunch here and the place was busy.  The service was extremely fast and very good.  We had the fresh spring roll appetizer followed by  vegetables delight with chicken which was delicious.Quaint old house! Guacamole was yummy. I ordered a side with the tacos. Alberto was a friendly and attentive server. We appreciated his service. A nice place to hang with friends or in my case, my hubby. Nice music. A must try. We'll be back!My family has been coming for years and have never had a bad meal. It's amazing service from the time you make a reservation to the follow up call the next day. My only real complaint is it's a little to dark people using phones or a flash light to read a menu seems ridiculous. How can you tell if your steak is cooked right? The bone in ribeye is the best in my opinion and butter cake is my dad's hands down favorite dessertGreat selection of beer, actually excellent selection of beer! 
Beautiful location!
The food was one of the best for a great value. But the thing that got me, was the fact that I ordered a pint of Guinness, and they gave me a brown Guinness. Now when I order one I always expect a perfect pint, so that was unfortunate.
Great food, great selections, good value, maybe not experienced bartenders, next time I come, definitely just a Bud Light.Good margaritas and average food; great happy hour. 

Happy hour is from 3p-6p daily with cheap beers (if you like PBR, it's less than $2 a beer) and half off appetizers. They have specials on margaritas too (buy one get one free). I actually enjoy their margaritas but don't care for their food. I've been here a few times when I used to live in Henderson but I haven't been back since I've moved closer to the strip.

Would recommend Nacho Daddy for margaritas and beer during happy hour. I wouldn't go hungry though...Some of the best sandwiches I've had anywhere.  We have been trying to get to the Goodwich on a Vegas Trip for a long time and now that they have moved into the new restaurant we finally MADE IT!  The reviews did not lie.  That Reubin...  It should be illegal to have a sandwich that good.  Just go eat here.  Do it...  Yeah... It's Hipster...  but suck it up and get a sandwich...What a great find! We just tried Sushi Hagi and are impressed by the quality and service.  They have only been open about a month and a half but they know what they're doing. The quality was excellent. The shrimp in the  tempura app and ebi was perfect, all the fish impeccably fresh and skillfully prepared. I was happy to find a futomaki on the menu and it did not disappoint. PLUS fresh wasabi. The room is very plain but the quality of the food and service at a reasonable price will have us returning soon.The food was okay.  The service was poor.  The stainless steel cup with water was horrible.  The cup has steel rusts in the bottom.  The Asian server\/manager knew about it and did not apologize.  She just smiled and was proud to say, "This is stainless steel."  I was disappointed and not happy.  If I will have Tetanus, Dhaba is going to be sued!  I am not going back again.

Health Disclaimer:
Please check your stainless steel cup.  Does it have stains?  Do you have a Tetanus shot?  Your life and health are at risk!Being from NY it is hard to find authentic Italian food. I stumbled upon this place and it is now a family favorite. The food and service are absolutely amazing.I had the Venice & it was vegan & let me tell you, it was so good! They used gardin steak & it was life changing. My vegan friends loved it too. Would def recommend!Stolen money $800. Dont eat here. Thieves.I have a feeling some of the initial poor reviews that were released  were due to growing pains, as it happens with lots of new restaurants. I think there's even been some shift in management and staff. I had a wonderful experience at Bin 86.

The ambiance was relaxed and comfortable. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The food was tasty and served promptly and they had a nice selection of quality wines. My guest and I ordered a selection of meats and cheeses, which were presented very delicately, followed by some Bruscetta and beef skewers. None of the food disappointed. 

I also got to have a really great conversation with one of the managers, Matt, about his history in the wine business while we sampled some delicious Red's and dessert wine.

If you've been here before and had a bad experience, I'd recommend giving it a second try, and if you haven't been, you should check it out!Close to yonge and Wellesley, this Korean restaurant is one of my preferred places in the area when in the mood for Korean food. I had a 2 person mild stirred meat pot and it was delicious. The meat was cooked just right, and sauce had a nice sweetness to it. The wide variety of side dishes were some of the most delicious side dishes I've had compared to other Korean restaurants. The service was also very good -- and the free Wi-Fi is a nice bonus!Stopped by today after hitting up Town Square and grabbed a cobb salad w\/ chicken to go. Been to many other Smash locations in the valley and haven't been disappointed with one until now. First off, the employees are kind of clueless here which drags out the ordering process.

The salad looked the same as usual at first glance but after I left the store and later tried to eat my salad, I realized they hadn't included any dressing. Really? I'm sure they just forgot but I'm now left with a salad that can't be eaten. If I had gone home that would be a different story but I didn't and was still out, which means there is nowhere to find salad dressing. I'll he back to Smash but not this oneWent here yesterday, the food was eww terrible. It was not worth $13, the variety of food was real limited. Also they do not make it fresh, they let it sit out in the open all day long. If I had to choose between mcdonalds and no buffet. Mcdonalds would get the award!It's a cool concept. I do have to admit that I love coming here, I just wish the food quality was just a lil bit higher.How have I never reviewed this place before?

Its got a great location, right at the corner of Yonge and Finch.

Cheap drinks too. They're definitely not that bad.

I've come here so many times it's hard to count.

Highlights:

1. Sketchy Patrons who are fun to talk to when drunk. Just don't invite people to sit at your booth.

2. The food here is pretty standard fare.

3. Except for the build your own salad, which is fucking phenomenal. LOVE IT. There's a little sheet at your table, and you just check off in different compartments what you'd like in your salad. Theres the greens, the colour, the crunch, the veggies, the protien, the dressing. So awesome.

4. The waitresses are pretty nice.

5. THE BOOTHS ARE SO SPACIOUS. I have never had so much room in a booth before. +++++++++++++++++++++++++++Food was meh, side dishes were terrible, service was pretty much non-existent, and prices are ridiculously expensive. I understand it's located on the strip so nothing is cheap, but still. Long story short, it was a rather disappointing experience and I don't recommend this place if you're craving for good Korean food.The quintessential neighborhood bar, Aces has a cool but welcoming vibe where customers can range from octogenarians to tattooed vaping hipsters.

In the past we've had trouble finding a place in the bar away from dreaded tobacco smokers (don't they watch the horror story commercials and realize you can only be so hip missing your tongue, teeth, and jaw).

This time we found a relatively smoke free corner and we throughly enjoyed our visit. The beer was outstanding - I had the midnight ritual (not a very large pour, but with a great kick and awesome complex flavor profile) and the chai milk stout which was creamy, smooth and flavorful.

We had the Bacon Bombs appetizer and were throughly impressed. The Bacon Bombs consisted of in-house cheese stuffed jalapeños, panko breaded, wrapped in bacon, and deep fried. They were just perfect, served hot and not greasy. A sumptuous combination of flavors. We were there on a busy evening so our waiter was a bit slow, but since he was covering a good portion of the bar I totally understood. He was accommodating despite being overworked.I'm slowly becoming a fan of the breaded hooters wings. The 3 mile sauce isn't very spicy, but it has good flavor. The loaded tots are awesome. Probably the best thing on their menu. The staff is friendly waitresses come around quite often to refill drinks. Good spot for lunchSaucisserie dans les Cours Valois où l'on trouve une grande variété de saucisses dont la fameuse William suisse ( saucisse fumée avec du fromage emmental ).  Les saveurs sont très variées : chou rouge, fromage bleu, fines herbes, italiennes, inferno, mexicaine, et j'en passe! Vous pouvez vous faire faire un sandwich européen avec le choix de saucisses du jour.  Ce que j'aime bien de cette franchise ce qu'elle vous offre un choix de condiments pour votre sandwich un peu plus varié contrairement aux autres franchises : olives, piments forts, choucroutes et cornichons.  Ils ont une belle sélection de bières de micro-brasserie, de charcuterie et de condiments pour complèter votre repas de saucisses.
J'ai souvent eu la chance d'être servi par une des propriétaires qui était fort sympathique et tout à fait charmante, tout comme le reste du personnel.  Bref, un endroit à visiter lorsqu'on recherche de la bonne saucisse!It's not the bakery that I go for, even though their Eclairs and Macaroons are the closes thing to heaven! It's the 24 hour availability the delicious sandwiches and coffee drinks and the free wifi. This is a great place to kick back and get some reading done or just people watch. Also, a great place to take visitors. They're impressed overtime.Really wanted to love BAKN. Interesting menu and decor attracted us to give it a try. What can I say? It just wasn't a good experience. Meeting friends and decided to start at the bar. The bartender seemed lost as fumbled his way through our drinks, asking me how to make a "Rusty Nai"l and guessed wrong on a friend's "Cosmo". Adding to commotion, bartender functions as coffee Batista for waiters, another distraction for the inept bartender. By the time our table was ready, we had the "pleasure" of observing a manager (owner?) terrorize and humiliate a waitress for what appeared to be a minor mistake (dinner and a show?). 

Because of its convenient location and attempt to be something special, our friends agreed to give BAKN another try. Sadly, our 2nd visit was similar to the 1st, it seemed like "Groundhog Day". Apparently, management prefers criticizing employees to actual training. Despite the interesting concept, poor management is likely to spell doom for BAKN.This place is so nice and have all the hipster vibes one would want. The food is cheap and the Swedish meatballs give the Italian place next block a run for their money. There are so many good things going on in this cafeteria setting that I am proud to say it's a great place to bring your first date. 

They say that most people or a lot of people break up in ikea so that if you can survive IKEA, that person is probably a keeper! 

The prices have gone up recently but not by much. The famous 10 meatballs with fries or mash potatoes is $6.99. They no longer offer free coffee if you are an IKEA family member.We all know Fiesta Burrito has great food, but that's not my issue here. PRICES. They have raised their prices almost comparable to sitting down at a full service dining restaurant. A carne asada burrito, beans and rice combination: $9.28... with the burrito having shrunk in bulk noticeably. 
Not sure if they have lost business and are struggling, or if they are hoping to reap the benefits of the new mass apartment complexes going in across the street from them.The food is ok, but the portions are TINY and they are so stingy with everything and the staff is unpleasant about it. For the price, it's a TERRIBLE deal. If you want to leave somewhere hungry, this is your place.Barro's is our go to date night place when we go out with other couples.  Great Pizza no matter what you choose, and the "Honey Hot Bone-In" chicken wings are lights out good.  Not to mention they have a glassed of area with toys and children size tables and chairs for families.  Service is consistently good and we always have a good time.I've never eaten at a Chinese vegetarian restaurant and finally had the chance to go.  I was pleasantly surprised at the very large menu.  It looked like a typical Chinese restaurant menu.  The servers were friendly and efficient.  We tried one of their newer dishes, BBQ pork and I was a sceptical at first.  But it actually tasted really good and had the same flavouring as BBQ pork but of course a different texture but still flavourful.  We also tried several other dishes and I was amazed at how everything was tasty and without meat!  I stuffed myself but unlike being stuffed after eating meat it didn't feel heavy.  It was like going to a regular Chinese restaurant except it was vegetarian.  I'm not vegetarian but I did really enjoy my meal.  The restaurant is very no frills but that's fine by me as long as the food is good.  I'll definitely be back.Heard about this place from everyone raving about it. We came in and we're probably the first customers of the day. The music was blaring and the ice cream machines were going full bore. We had to yell our order and the employee still couldn't hear it and even he said it was too loud in there. When we tried to order fountain drinks, the employee told us the soda dispenser isn't working and the photos are flat. He told us to buy a soda from the cooler, because it would be cheaper. The sodas in the cooler were in mini bottles. We were told that there was no ice. They were waiting for a delivery.  Doesn't make for a relaxing lunch break. As for the food, the crepes were nicely done with great ingredients. The floats were delicious. That's a shame the business cannot be more organized. Very simple things that could be easily corrected.The best hotdogs around!!! We will definitely be back soon!!! So glad I let my coworkers talk me into having lunch here. We done takeout on my next visit we will go eat in.Loved the place, amazing food, not too expensive, service crew was especially wonderful, we're going back for sure.I have been here in forever and I forgot how good it was. Deff come here for vegetarian food- it's the best (and I'm not a vegetarian). This is a Cleveland staple. Glad I rediscovered it again! Oh, PS, they have meat as well haha!We were in Vegas for a conference and looking for a reasonably priced steakhouse and fouled Charlie Palmer's on Yelp. Our hotel concierge made a reservation for us at 7:00 p.m...probably a good idea...

The restaurant didn't disappoint. We had the filet and the Ribeye. Everything is A la carte, so you have to order vegie separately. Ends up costing a little over $60\/person.
The restaurant is located steps away from the hotel lobby, so unlike many other hotel\/casinos, you don't have to walk for miles to reach the restaurant.
Service was exceptional. Would return next visit if we visit Vegas again.My family has been coming here for over 10 years and this restaurant never, ever disappoints. Each dish tastes like the first time. The owner Ken is a wonderful and respectful host. Thank you Ken, you had me at Shrimp with Lobster Sauce!I personally LOVE Mariko and have been going there for years. The sashimi is always top notch and the service is usually pretty good. It has been most times I have been there.
They offer two all you can eat menus that are very reasonably priced and have a decent variety as well.It was whatever. Extremely overpriced. Honestly didn't even think the food was that good. Decent atmosphere, service was good, but that was about it. Came here with a group after a recommendation. Not sure if I would come here again.Beautiful bar, super close to pnc park. Was excited to visit after a pirates game...BUT, do not expect good service. I sat at the bar for 15 minutes without getting acknowledged. Went next door and had immediate service. Stay clear of hereI never write a review of fast food chains but my wife was insistent because she enjoyed her char-broiled burger so much. The meat was charred just the way she liked it. I had the teriyaki burger and enjoyed it a lot too. 
We've eaten at quite a few Carl's before but she said this was absolutely the best. Raved about it all day.This restaurant is one of the best in Pittsburgh. I haven't had one thing here that I didn't love. No matter what, start with the Pork Belly Steamed Buns as an appetizer. They are seriously out of this world and perfect to split. As far as noodles, the Kee Mao with tofu (they have meat options, too, don't worry) was the first thing that I tried at Noodlehead. Even if you're not a big tofu fan, their's is cooked perfectly and goes well with the other ingredients in this dish really well. Highly recommended. For something a bit more saucy, my other two favorites are the Chiang Mai Curry and the Green Curry Linguine. Honestly, though, you can't go wrong at this place. 

A few important things: they don't take reservations and it can be packed around dinner time, alcohol is BYOB with a very small "recycling" fee, and it's cash only which is less of a big deal now that they have their own ATM. Service is not always the friendliest, but, given the price and style of the place, it's nothing to be bothered by.

Go to Noodlehead. Seriously, you won't regret it.Where do I start...went in there for Christmas eve dinner.  What a mess...first of all we got there early for our 8:45 reservations...finally got seated at 9:15...then we waited...server finally came around and dropped off some tasty bread.  I asked for a Blue Moon and he said he didn't think they had any left...my Dad ordered a dos eques...again they didnt have that...so i went with water and they did have Heineken.  I ordered two of the shrimp cocktail and calamari appetizer...which was excellent.  That took forever to show up as well.  Then comes the issues with the main course....My order came out wrong, my dads original order of Prime Rib, they ran out of but weren't told about it until well past 10:15, so he ordered the larger filet, which came out  smaller than my daughters small filet...my dads filet was luke warm at best and potatoes were actually cold, my daughters filet and potatoes were in the same temp range...really unfortunate, since the cuts of meat were great and done perfectly.  Our server was completely overwhelmed and was attempting to do his best, but in the end, everything put together made for a horrible experience...we informed the waiter of our dissatisfaction with everything...Our bill was over $300...when we left, i purposefully walked past the manager, and he wouldn't even acknowledge me...he had walked past out table a couple tomes previously, and I guess i expected at least some sort of acknowledgement from a manager of what this type of restaurant is attempting to be...what they could be, what they are pretending to be, has nothing to do with what we experienced on Christmas Eve...My thoughts on this place are as follows,
The service was kind of slow, but this was probably due to the large parties that came in and being short staffed. The live music was nice, it got a little loud to where you had to shout, to be heard.
My husband and I ordered:
the calamari fritti- it was good would be better if it wasn't cold.
Ceasar Salad- the croutons were really good, the lettuce was bitter and had wilted 
The pizza: actually pretty good, very similar to pizza in Italy. 
The linguine with meatballs: was ok, I've had better.



Overall I was satisfied. Was I blown away? No.
I will order pizza and pick it up next time, BC the pizza was good.Only go here is you really, really want seafood. There are none seafood stations, but even then a lot of the dishes are seafood dishes. The non-seafood dishes are actually pretty good. The prime rib and dim sum stations in particular stick out. They probably don't go through as much of those as seafood so they don't have to cut corners. 

As far as the seafood goes, it seems to change seasonally. Each time I have been there, they have had snow crab and stone crab legs. They have never had king crab when I was there. They had crawfish on this trip as well. One of the attractions is the "lobster". I say "lobster" in quotations because they are langostinos, which are more closely related to the hermit crab than a lobster or shrimp. These are what you get when you order Lobster Bites at Long John Silver. It's funny seeing how many people line up for the "lobster". Some people take their sweet time picking out the biggest ones. They used to have two areas to get them, but now there is only one and it is in the middle of the seafood station, leading to unnecessarily huge lines.

I've never really tried any of the desserts except the gelato. I actually get cravings for the Elvis (peanut butter and banana) flavor once in a while. The service is really good here though. Probably the best service I've ever had in a Vegas buffet.I came here based on all the great reviews I found on yelp. But it would be an understatement to say I was disappointed. One of the worst Indian food I have ever had. There was not even a single item that stood out. Seemed like everything was stale food. The tandoori chicken seemed to have been painted with red color. Even the Naan was not good. Even before we settled down the server brought the Naan out and by the time we came back with our plates it was already cold. Please stay away from this place.We had the pizza and it was just ok. Maybe it's the style but the crust seemed a little hard to me plus it was on the expensive side. I think there are better pizza places in the area. I would like to try some of the other option sometime.I may not be the best to review this place since I didn't eat the sushi. The rice and teriyaki chicken were ok, but the rice had a weird taste to it. The tempura vegetables were bland and the desserts lacked flavor. I did enjoy the walnut tarts but that was the extent of what i really liked. Children should be free, especially since I have a child who decided 5 bites of dinner was enough. 
My husband on the the other hand tried every single sushi roll they had because he liked them so much, so much so he got sick. 
it was my first and probably my last time there.Over-rated.
They cheapout on vegetables and I hate it when restaurants do that.
Price is expensive.What to say about a cafe that makes delicious cuisine, amazing mochas and has super-terrific-yummy-delicious bacon? VISIT!

This was the last meal we had before heading back to the Golden State after our stay in AZ and it couldn't have gone any better. 

The atmosphere inside definitely reminds me of a New York type establishment, yet I've never been to NY. The service was impeccable, very nice and accommodating to requests we had. The food was *muah*, deliciosa. I really don't have any words because it would not do it any justice, it me had and enjoyed. Allow your mouth to become engulfed in a festival of flavors that will leave you wanting more!A small group of us had brunch here on a recent trip at the suggestion of a friend. The day we visited was my birthday, which we informed the hostess of when we made reservations the day before. The entire staff, throughout the reservation process the day before through the meal the following morning, was very courteous. 

We were seated in a rounded booth that faced the Bellagio, which was ideal for me as I find the building to be beautiful and of course there are the fountains. From our seats, it was easier to see the fountains when they were shooting higher - the views from the small tables that line the windows look to be amazing. I was a little disappointed that halfway through the meal, shades were drawn halfway over the windows and thus limited our view.

We had anticipated the prix fixe menu ($39\/pp), before realizing there was also regular menu options. I opted for the french toast, which was listed in the menu as having a vanilla cream, bananas, and pecans. Upon its arrival, there was bacon (actually, pancetta as I was informed) resting on it. I informed our server that I am a vegetarian, and had my only unpleasant moment during this experience -- while he took the dish back to have it corrected, I was not given an apology of any kind but merely told "that's the pancetta". This item was not listed in the description on the menu, so I did not know when ordering to request that it not be included.

The food itself was good, after being corrected. I also opted to have the warm apple dessert, which we were told needed to be ordered in advance due to preparation time. This came out a little more crisp than I would have normally preferred, but overall it was a good dessert. In addition to this, I was given a small chocolate dessert for my birthday. As a chocolate lover, I found this to be very good and especially enjoyed the chocolate slice that topped it.

Overall, I really enjoyed this restaurant and would return on a future trip so long as the menu still contains items I find appetizing. I would be more careful when ordering to ensure that the option does not contain any kind of meat, however. 

As a final thought, they sell a few items including cookbooks and chocolate bars. As I raved about the chocolate slice on my dessert, my brother purchased a chocolate bar for me. I wish I could say that this was the same chocolate, but will admit that the purchased bar is very good as well -- it is a dark chocolate bar with sea salt. As someone who doesn't care much for salt, I find the combination in this bar to pair very well.As I write this review, I am ready to go into hibernation. Like a bear storing up for winter, I have gorged on a bounty of meats and greens. In Vegas, the weather is not cold enough and there is never a shortage of food, but that did not stop me from mauling every piece of flesh placed in front of me. The worst part is that I did not even try all 15 types of meat and passed on seconds.

On second thought, I would make a very poor bear. Nonetheless, the 12 kinds of protein that I tried were all amazing. I have tried a few other churrascarias around Las Vegas, but none compare to Fogo in value or quality. The salad bar is fresh and bountiful. One round, and plate stacked high, gave me a taste of everything. The hearts of palm and large asparagus spears are a nice touch to add to my salad. 

When it came to meat, the bacon wrapped filet mignon and the Picanha were the stand outs. The latter had a nice crust on it that was juicy yet seared to perfection. Even the chicken was the best I have experienced. Normally, at other places, I take a bite and feel underwhelmed. Not here, it is so moist and flavorful. The caramelized bananas were the only plate they needed to replace several times throughout lunch. I might have liked the fried polenta, but had an insatiable spot for the bananas. I cut myself off at two plates. 

If that was not enough, dessert is spectacular as well. My friend and I shared a Chocolate Molten Cake and a slice of Key Lime Pie. Both were exquisite. The chocolate bundt cake had a liquid center that oozed down upon breaking. Served with vanilla ice cream gave a nice contrast of hot and cold. All of that made it better with the contrast to the other dessert. The Key Lime had a tartness that was not overbearing and cleanse the palate of the rich chocolate.

Now in retrospect, I should just tell everyone to read Tony T.'s review, because I echoed everything he said in lesser detail.Waitress was very helpful in giving suggestions as to what we could try and she did check on us several times. They were fast. We did like what was suggested like the Empress fried rice and congee with mushrooms. I did try chicken in black bean sauce.  Next day, we came back and was not disappointed. And restrooms were clean. Hope to visit on our next vacation and try some dishes.Not worth it. I went to Masto's for the first time this weekend. I brought my fiancé and future in-laws. We arrived a little early and got a drink at the bar\/lounge. The drinks were great and the lounge had an energetic atmosphere, which we liked. Our table was promptly ready and we were seated at our reserved time in the dining room. The entire dining room seamed to be rolling their eyes as we were being seated next to a table of 8, boasting one very loud and belligerent neanderthal. I hate to admit it, but the behavior of this one person ruined our experience and that of the other patrons around us. We could hardly hear each other at our own table to make conversation. Perhaps the most aggravating thing, was the fact that the staff failed to address the issue after our table and other tables made them aware of the disruptive idiot. We didn't get so much as an apology. They remained willfully oblivious to this behavior as if we were at an Outback or Sizzlers, even as the idiot attempted to physically assault another patron who kindly asked him to keep it down. It was ridiculous! Mastro's even posted a staff member in a white coat to stand guard near the table in case any further altercation erupted. All the while, this behavior was permitted and seemingly authorized by Mastro's staff who failed to make any effort to enhance the experience of the other patrons having to endure the antics of this drunk buffoon. I had, what I would consider to be a reasonable expectation of service and ambiance at a steakhouse like Mastro's, which turned out to be woefully unmet. They did a great job cleaning the peanut shells off the floor, I will give them that.This Taco Bell drive thru is rediclious at night. Waiting 15 plus minutes to get to the speaker and another 5 minutes to get your food is crazy! You get stuck in the line and can't to anywhere and then I'm missing a taco!!! Not the first the first time I have had this experience but it will be the last time. A manager or store owner needs to fix this. How long does it take to make tacos or burritos with pre-made ingredients in a system where the process is standardized for efficiency? Never fast food restaurant with such poor service.AVOID THIS PLACE.
The place is grim, with half of the space closed(at least looks so). The staff? Not very welcoming. The whole service just looks very unregulated. The food tastes funny, I felt the soup is made with some weird chemicals instead of pork.But those are not the point.The worst part is I went to this restaurant and felt bad until I threw up everything. This is the first time I write anything on yelp, just to inform all people who are kinda interested in this place of one piece of message:Get out of here unless you want food poisoning！Boy this used to be a 4-5 stars for me, but the last two times we had to wait for our food way too long and it came out cold and didn't taste very good.

I do like their white chicken chili and their pie.Visited for the first time here last night. Normally I do the drive to Fredricks in Markham but after just getting back from Windsor and just completing a  3 1\/2 drive....the thought of driving to Markham from Vaughan was just not appealing.
Types Hakka Food on the Yelp search line and this place popped up. Location was convenient (straight down the 400 and a right on Finch....a 12 minute drive from home). Thanks to this visit, I now have another option for Hakka other than Fredricks.
First off, this place is not fancy by any means. The décor is dreadful (plastic, dusty plants), old tables, cafeteria style seating.....but you're not here for the décor.
We started with Chicken Pekoras...they were spicier than those I'm accustomed too, but excellent non the less. You get 10 for around $9 and they are worth every penny.
We also ordered a rice dish (Manchurian Rice) and Chili Chicken with Gravy (you have the option of getting them dry). All were excellent and the rice was very spicy (Yah !).
The waitstaff were excellent....brought over a menu very quickly once we were seated and returned frequently to check on us.
All in all....despite the décor and loud atmosphere (a table arrived after we were 20 minutes into our meal who were VERY loud and disruptive)...we will return.
Food order, plus 2 drinks (water and pop), with tax, came to $30. Excellent value.THE FOOD IS INCREDIBLE.  THE SERVICE WAS EVEN BETTER.  My wife and I ordered 2 plates of fried chicken with 2 sides each and 2 cokes.  20 bucks.  Are you kidding me. NEWSFLASH TO THE PEOPLE IN HUNTERSVILLE WHO DO NOT TIP- THE LADY DID A GREAT JOB SO I GAVE HER 5 BUCKS.  Make sure you tip, it is the right thing to do.   Simple , southern food done incredibly well.  We will be going back.  If they served breakfast there it would be nice .....HINT, HINT.Nice quaint place, clean and basic. I asked them to repeat a few things and there was a language barrier which was difficult because I settled for what I actually wanted. Please understand English if you have a restaurant, or hire an interpreter. 

I had the spicy pork nachos. They let you build them kinda like Subway does with their sandwiches, kinda cool. I asked for more meat and pointed at the picture that was fully topped with meat and the guy ignore me and put my nachos in the microwave inside styrofoam to melt the cheese. I was taken back and knew then I should had left. Styrofoam plus microwave equals poison. I was too hungry to care. After munching on about two thirds of the nachos I noticed that my styrofoam had melted into my food, sick. I'll pay for the toxins later, 

I went up to the cashier and pointed it out and asked for a refund, he said I shouldn't have eaten it if I wanted my money back, I responded that I just discovered it (since it was near the bottom side) and I was still hungry and intended to finish it if it wasn't melted to my meal. After a few exchanges (civil ones) I fought back my refund. 

The place could easily be a four star if they knew English, didn't melt my styrofoam container containing my meal and had better customer service skills. 

I won't go back. 

In my picture I posted of the nachos, you can see on the bottom left backside that it's melted.I went to Nook Kitchen as it is close to my Office and opened quickly - it is going through a soft Opening and here is my review;

SERVICE - Excellent Service from the staff (Hostess, Servers, Bartenders, etc.) Prompt, courteous and offered suggestions

DECOR - Great Decor -  interior of restaurant is very nice.  Funny thing is the builders did not realize they put doors that open OUT towards the patio and placed a table right in front of one of the doors - maybe a slider would have been a better idea!  Also figure a door would have been placed by the corner as you need to enter the Hotel to get to the Restaurant - Hotel Lobby is Extremely Nice!

FOOD - Found the food to be okay - here is what I ordered;

1. Shrimp Coktail - Shrimp themselves were very Good, but the Cocktail Sauce had too much Lemon in it - considering it was served with two Lemon Wedges, I would have preferred to add my own instead of tasting mainly lemon - also prefer a little more heat - was nearly no spice at all.

2. Beer Braised Pork Butt Bruschetta (Half Order) - I wanted to order one of the Bruschetta choices and the Server recommended this one so I went with it.  The pork itself was Great, but the bread it was on was Mush\/soft.  It literally tasted like I was eating an open faced sandwich on white bread - maybe this is part of the learning process, but the bread in a Bruschetta should be crispy! 

3. Meatball Sandwich with French Fries - Meatballs were very Good - Real Deal Cheese and Bread was similar to a Pita which I liked - disappointment here is the minimal amount of Sauce that was involved in the sandwich

PRICE - Total came to $41.00 without Tip - I had 5 Shrimp, Half order (2 pieces) of Bruschetta and a Meatball Sandwich with French Fries and an Unsweetened Tea.

It is a new place and normally I would not order Shrimp Cocktail, Bruschetta and a sandwich, but I wanted to try various options - I will try some other sandwiches and salads in the next months, but I am not rushing back to try them - the meal was okay and is Pricey for LunchWe were a group of 7 for dinner, and came to check it out for the first time since the new owners took over. The meal was excellent. I had the rundown, a veggie dish, and my wife had the jerk chicken. Both were delicious. Highly recommended!I have been here a couple of times. The best thing about this place is the service and the warm bread they bring out with the food. The potato spuds were decent nothing special. It has huge portions and its relatively cheap so if you're looking for a huge breakfast come check this place out!Worst place ever no service beers are hot no costumer service what so ever if you do go there make sure to  pay attention to what you order... we asked for the fan to be moved sans is on the table and the server said it was ok to move it ... latter a guy moved it i ask him to move it  and the so call manger said no" I told him what the server  said and he still said no. Than i give the buckets of beer to the table next to me and tried to leave than the people at the  table next to us told us not to... than the manager" started to grave my husband he told him not to and then hi started to pull him from his belt pushed him outside and then 3 of them tried to make him react by surrounding him they have guns on there belts and wend my husband told them I was calling the police they all wen inside. Be really careful when you decide to go there.I love this place I love the bowls and I love the staff I strongly recommend. The staff was lovely and the place was really clean. The service was also efficient and the hooked me up with a coupon they are lovely!This is consistently my favourite Ethiopian restaurant. Friendly,reasonable delicious.Five stars across the board!
The place was hard to locate, since the street address puts them at the other end of the building on Bland St, but once I found the garage, it was on.
We had the Tori Kara Age (fried chicken) and the Rice Crispy Squares appetizers, what a treat, especially the chicken, every bite tasted like crispy chicken skin. The tuna was fresh and seasoned nicely, presentation was wonderful.
I had the Tonkatsu pork broth with pork belly and it was full of veggies and loaded with flavor. 
My wife enjoyed the Niwa vegan broth with veggies, wonderful as well. I finished all mine and was jealous when she had leftovers a little later in the day. 
We will be back often!1st waiter was awesome:
But-
Started with brown guacamole in appetizer
Asked for water w\/lemon got water no lemon. Ordered chicken with broccoli & baked potato fully loaded. Baked potato had no butter hence not loaded. Broccoli was going bad where it had black on it and it was turning yellow and tasted rotten. I asked a blonde waitress for a to go box and she must have been having a bad day cause she looked at my plate that I hadn't touched and was so rude cause I asked for just a to go box. Mngr comes to the table and offered to give me a piece of cake or something . This industry is horrible I remember when a piece of hair was in someone's food they at least comped ur plate mine was only rotten after everything else and nothing. So I found my coupon to at least use to comp myself. This was sad cause they New they were wrong as I left they added to this and gave me no reciept . I went back in that's for sure and got it. I use to love TGIF! USE TO! That's not how to treat a customer.You must try the burger!!!! It's so damn good. It looks fairly small but it truly is what's on the inside that counts. I wasn't able to finish off the generous serving of fries that it came with. At $22, it's totally worth it. 

I went there for a bachelorette dinner of 10 girls. And super kudos to Richmond Station, they were THE ONLY restaurant that didn't impose some ridiculous restriction like 55\/pp family meal with a 500$ non refundable deposit. 

That's why they're getting 5 stars. Good job!This place looked pretty promising coming in, but it's a disappointment. After 30 min of waiting at the table, only 3 carvings were offered to us. Turns out that the restaurant only 4 carvers for the whole thing. Meat when it comes is just bland. The Only thing that saved this place is that our waiter was trying his best and was friendly throughout.Fairly run of the mill pizza and Italian food. Really nice patio and good for larger groups. I preferred Grimaldi's when it was in this spot but overall not bad. Only been once.food was good not great, the butter popcorn shrimp was better the other places. Cost was averge we dined in and try most of the food. Was standard mixed buffet. not a lot of asian food, sushi was not good.  The place needs make over dull and no shine to the place.I'm hesitant to give a hot-dog place this many stars, but I'll make a confession, guilty pleasure of mine. West coast guy here, loving this east coast staple. This eatery is new to my recently gentrified neighborhood in Vegas, couldn't be happier. This place will be on my rotation.I have mixed feelings as I write this review.  Splendido is still a splendid place to entertain business guests or enjoy a special occassion dinner, you would not get better service anywhere else, delivered with such finesse and proficiency.  However, the food on our recent visits didn't produce any "wow" moment.  Years ago when out of town visitors asked for a sampling of Toronto's finest dining, I would always put Splendido near top of the list.  I will probably hesitate more now...

I am still a fan, hoping to be wowed.The food here was pretty good. It's in line with average bar food. I got the French dip, it was average (nothing special about it) but it was good. The service was very good, the waitress was very attentive. The best part of this place is the cool outdoor patio with misters.This was the best thing that I ate on my Vegas trip.  (Surpassed all of the fancy expensive meals).  The burger was cooked perfectly, (the meat quality is great so they cook it med-rare.)  Every topping was well though out and added to the flavor of the burger.  (I got the one with the fried egg on top).  I wasn't even hungry when I ate my burger but by the time I was done I wanted more!

The only downfall is it took for.... ever... to get my burger.  (20+ minutes... they must have been killing the cow in back).  I rarely drop stars for service but I did in this case.

I lived in Vegas before and have been to the Fuku Burger Truck many times and am glad to see this establishment is here.Seated promptly..received water quickly after.. then it seemed we were forgotten shortly after. After waiting and flipping through the menu for about 20 minutes while employees walked by us multiple times, making eye contact and everything, we decided to get up and go somewhere else. It wasn't until then that we were acknowledged. And what was said was"Did you eat?" Like we were dining and dashing instead of leaving because we were being ignored. Annoying.Great service, great food!  Chicken parm, spaghetti with meatballs, chicken marsala, and Caesar salad all very good!  You will probably need a reservation as this place typically has a long wait.  Request a table by the windows overlooking the strip!Their firehouse burger is too die for!!!! The service was a little lacking but nothing overly outrageous to keep me from going back.I recently went to this restaurant to mainly try out the street food. First, I do think the price per stick is quite expensive. They charge $1.39\/stick. In terms of taste, I thought it was really flavorful. My family and I tried out the adidas, isaw, tenga, betamax, fishball, and kwek kwek. I was a little disappointed with the kwek kwek because I was honestly expecting it to be bigger, but you really just get the size of a quail egg. I believe the make their own sauces and it's actually pretty good and balances out the taste. I would also recommend their sisig! It comes out on a sizzling plate so you get the crunchy bits and just overall a good flavor. It's hard to find Filipino street food in Vegas so I recommend everyone to at least try this place out for that reason. 

The place itself is clean and nicely decorated. They literally show off the Filipino culture with their wall paintings.I am not a big Yelp contributor,  but I am so disappointed in The Haymaker.  I loved this restaurant when it first opened and I would always take friends and family there when they visited from out of town.  Each time I have visited in the past few months, it has been going down hill.  When I used to visit The Haymaker, my glass would never be empty. Now, I never get a refill.  They used to put a leaf of lettuce on the burgers\/sandwiches,  now it's shredded. They used to offer a to go iced Coffee when we left, now they do not. They had the best Toasted Almond flavored iced coffee, now they do not. They didn't have marinara sauce for the mozzarella sticks, no marinara available (Saturday afternoon). They have $2 Bud Light drafts for happy hour which is fantastic. There was a butt end of a tomato on my "medium" burger which was medium\/rare. I asked for an onion slice on my burger, there was one ring of onion (see picture). I will not be visiting The Haymaker unless I hear things change.New Restaurant on Fremont St. Great vibes, staff and food!
We had a party of 8 and everyone loved their food and drinks!
I had the Steak sandwich - one of the best I've had. The salmon was great and my son is still talking about his Turkey Burger and of course the truffle fries- I would go back for just those!  Service was friendly - a great addition to downtown.Great tapas and whatever we ordered was good and tasty. Compliments to the chef. Very creative and I recommend the rice pudding for desert. Never had anything like it. Over all great place and fun restaurant to eat specially when u sit at the bar.To start off I will say they are committed. They are one of the only places open late. After ordering my phone was on silent so I missed the 3 calls they placed to find my house. An hour later they arrived food still hot.

However, the woman that took my order just took my name, address and phone number.   When they arrived it was a slight ordeal because I had no cash and had to pay by credit card, she called the store and it took quite a long time for them to discuss and run my card. 

The food is not flavorful, and now I have a stomach ache. The fried rice looks dyed and the lo me in has orange oil in the bottom. :-(Good food with flexible menu options. The only real issue I can think of with it is that the building itself is kind of small, which is a complete non-issue during the warmer seasons, when you have the rest of public square to relax.Met my BFF for lunch during the week. We were practically the only ones there at the time, which is great. Sat by the window and had a view of the strip. I was starving so I just ordered a bunch of things. I LOVE the spicy tuna on crispy rice. In fact, we ordered a second serving. Sushi was fresh and excellent. Albacore in particular. 

Now remember we were pretty much the only people in the restaurant. So I have to say that the service was not the best. It wasn't horrible, but it was a bit slow and our server was MIA most of the meal. In fact, one of the items never came, but she didn't even notice. I brought it to her attention and said that we were full and to go ahead and cancel it. Her response was "okay". I'm not sure if she took it off the bill, I didn't check which is a very bad habit that I have. I will give them the benefit of a doubt and will say it was an off day. Other than that, I will go again. I would have given it 5 stars. 

Great food and great view.This was a nice change of pace from our typical road trip meal stops, but it was nothing that blew my socks off. The dog was fairly tasteless (I'd rather have my store-bought Hebrew National any day) and while the toppings were decent, it was nothing that made me say WOW, I WANT ANOTHER. I tried the home brew root beer and again, it was decent, but I like Barqs better. The best part of the meal was the fries. So, an A-OK stop and if I lived close I'd definitely try other menu options...but as a one-off stop, it didn't thrill me as much as I'd hoped.I could hardly wait to get to Montreal so I could go back to Chez L'Epicier.  The amuse bouche was the macaron with goat cheese which others have mentioned.  Sounds awful, tastes heavenly.  Next a shrimp salad...not  big ole shrimp on the side of the glass with seafood sauce. Oh no.  Little bitty shrimp with red grapefruit sections and radish. Filet for entree and would I like wild mushrooms, in season, with that?  Oh yes, please. Perfectly cooked.  Dessert was a delightful pistachio confection with itty bitty spheres of meringue.  How do they do that?  A cup of tea and I was blissful while I waited for the check.  But wait! There's more!  The server came back, not with the check,  but with a plate of homemade marshmallows and a little burner.  Just because the chef though I might enjoy them..."you know, like the campfire when we were children?"  Yes, but we never had homemade marshmallows at any campfire I ever sat around! And now I'm ruined.  Ruined.  I can never eat commercial marshmallows again.  No one else got the marshmallow treatment, everyone was looking as I toasted them, and why I got them I don't know.  Maybe just because I was so truly, honestly happy to be there again!Good food at a good price!  I had the Tomato, basil and mozzarella sandwich, which was delicious.  They challenged me to compare their cafe mocha to that 'other' coffee shop's version and I must say it was very good!  If I return to Montreal, I will visit this place again!quick dinner here for two of us was ok. salmon pasta dish was delivered instead of salmon Caesar but that was quickly corrected.  mushroom soup was tasty but not hot, barely warm when delivered.  great that they are next door to changing hands bookstore.Kudos to this location.  Despite being short staffed and very busy, they could see I am extremely visually impaired and were kind enough to bring my food to my table.  Now that is going above and beyond to assist the blind!  Good Karma to them - live long and prosper.  Highly recommend this location.This Kansas city native and recent Austin Texas transplant has high hopes when it comes to BBQ.....and man, Midwood delivered! Best brisket I've ever had. Great beer selection. Good collard greens. My fiancé got the ribs and said they were great.  I got the grilled cheese sandwich and added pulled pork on it and was loving every bite. Can't wait to go back!Yummy and delicious Thai food. I'm a big fan of the curries here. I don't think I have had a dish that wasn't really good. Of course, that's probably why it is always busy here. So yea you'll probably have to wait a bit and yea the service is a little slow, but keep yourself busy with some good company, have a beer, and soak in the atmosphere. Then when the food comes enjoy it, because you're in for a treat.It does not get any better than this honestly. From the moment we walked in to the moment we left, everything was great. My friend and I opted for the menu degustation with the wine pairing and it was heavenly. The sommelier explained and answered our questions very professionally and everything went well together. The food was amazing and our server was great. The GM was also very sweet. Their gift box at the end was very cute and a nice touch. Julian Serrano's restaurants always leave a lasting impression on me. I would recommend this place to anyone and will definitely come back.Très bonne surprise pour ce restaurant en plein cœur de East 4th le quartier touristique de Cleveland . J'avais pris des clams avec une sauce aux foies gras et oignons rouges un délice mon mari un steak tartare revisité excellent avec des pommes frites maison à l'ail et romarin. 
Les desserts valent le coup aussi. Les serveurs sont au top et la décoration ambiance ferme du middle-west  est trop sympa.Great meal, cool place. Make reservations if you want a table-but bar is fine. Lots of TVs to watch games. Casual or upscale if you feel like it.Love love loveeee the fried sushi rolls the offer. 
The only roll that I've tried and did not like at all was the Red Rock roll.. only because it had way too much sauce poured on it IMO. 

Depending on when you go, you could be waiting a while. I went for dinner on a Sunday night and waited about 15 minutes for a table for 2.. another couple walked in a few minutes after we arrived and weren't seated until we were getting ready to pay and leave. During the week is a bit less crowded.

Prices are not bad either.. Would recommend AYCE if you're hungry, but 3 rolls split between 2 was enough for me.Friendly service, delicious food, fast, easy, and affordable! Every piece of sushi we had there was awesome. We definitely will be going back!Authentic Szechuan.  Best I've had outside of Hong Kong and NYC.  Get the Hot and sour soup, Kung Pao Chicken (authentic style), and Szechuan wontons you won't be disappointed.  Don't be the fool!  Eat at Lee Cafe!!Yelp 100 Challenge 2013- 2\/100

I L-O-V-E this bid daddy Whole Foods Market!  It's my favorite within the greater Las Vegas area. The store has a massive selection of organic and natural (and hard to find) products.  Yes, I can understand why they nickname Whole Foods 'whole paycheck.' However, I'm also a firm believer that you get what you pay for. When you fork over your wallet for the organic treats, you're also funding an ethically run business- and that comes at a cost. 
I will continue my love affair with this chain and enjoy my frequent visitsThe steak sandwich from Bardi's is a Bay Street staple. Those who have had it will know that there are often tough bits (which are especially awkward in a sandwich!) in the steak. Their dinner steaks are not much better (though slightly more affordable than other steak houses). To make up for it, Bardi's does have some of the best garlic and garlic\/cheese bread in the city! The interior looks like somewhere the Godfather would have frequented. It's nice, but from a different era... like the neon sign out front. I wouldn't turn down a meal at Bardi's, but there is better steak to be had in the city.I've been to Panera Bread before, and this one really isn't too different then other Panera Bread stores. The ordering process is the same, the food tasted the same which is a good thing because there's consistency that you expect when going to Panera Bread. I don't feel I need to give a review on the food because the food was enjoyable it's what I expected it was warmer it needed to be crunchy where needed to be spicy where it needed to be in tasty where needed.

My only real gripe is that although they use metal spoons and silverware, my spoon was so disgustingly dirty, I don't know how they could've wrapped it in a napkin or set it out for use, without seeing the mounds of old cheese and soup junk that was left on it. Super huge big problem, as a spoon up in the manager apologized and swapped it out for a clean one, but still if you're going to offer silverware please make sure its clean.First off id like to say that ive served at a sushi restuarant for two years so Ive had my share of good and bad sushi. 

to begin with i didnt really expect quality fish when it comes to revolving sushi. i ordered the tuna tataki off the menu hoping for a fancy plate with nicely seared tuna but it was just another regular small plate of thin and rubbery tuna. really disappointed. 

the sushi on the revolver was alright and I cant say that i was impressed. if you want good sushi id suggest trying elsewhere in the valley.This place is amazing! My favorite part is the happy hour from 2-5 & 9-close! The customer service is great! Food taste amazing! Highly recommend the screaming O & California Crunch roll! Soooo delicious! Definitely my new favorite sushi spot!!This place has potential.  It's in a nice resort and the space is nice with a bar and a patio.  We came here twice while staying at the resort.  It's a "family resort" so I was suprised to learn that they do not have a kids menu. The regular menu pretty much reads like a kids menu- Chicken strips, cheese pizza, etc...so maybe that's why they don't have one.  The menu here is pretty limited and it's basic bar-type food.  I got the burger with bleu cheese and carmelized onion and it was pretty good. My husband got a pizza and he said it was just OK.  The next time we tried it we ordered food to take to our suite. I ordered our food, a burger and a club sandwhich with avocado and no mayo on anything and 2 side salads with dressng on the side; and sat in the bar while I waited. The waitress came out twice after taking my order to confirm it since she didn't write it down. That was fine with me.  I was glad she was so determined to ensure everything was right. However, when I got back to the room, there was mayo on everything and dressing all over one salad and no dressing on he other, not even on the side. Boo.Bread pudding was amazing. And the made to order French toast is hard to beat. Great place for brunch with friends. Wish there were options for salad dressing though.Let me start by saying the place looks great and the service overall is quite good. However the quality of the food is just terrible. I have been here twice and got food poisoning the second time snd both times the dishes tasted like microwave food. Will not come back for sure and I suggest to avoid at all costs unless you got money to blow and need a real excuse to skip work the next day.These fresh made-to-order donuts are DIVINE! The Bacon In the Sun is a MUST. Please be prepared to ruin your diet. Love this place.Great little mom & pop place. There was only an older gentleman making the food,  but then shortly after,  I believe,  his wife came in & started helping with the cooking. Eventhough we waited a longer than normal for our food, it was well worth it. I got a veggie pannini & a salad & my husband got a grilled cheese with tomato soup. Both really yummy. We will definitely go back.Best pizza in town... I have been eating there once a month for a few years now , and i will never get tired of it .I really love bringing relatives here, they serve really delicious foods. It's fresh and my family really enjoy the dinner.Amazing!  Seafood was perfectly cooked, seasoned perfectly and many great options.  My 2 friends with me (1 of whom is a picky eater) loved the food.  His wife (more of a foodie) also loved her food.  A little pricey, but in keeping with other nice restaurants in Vegas.  Totally worth the price for attentive service and great food!The vegan honey company is hands down my favorite. The lady there is always so sweet, and friendly. Her honey is the best, I always go back for more. The tea stand next to hers is also amazing. Great environment, and just a great place to beWe ordered takeout for dinner. Called in advance and was told it would be ready in 10 mins. Walked over from our house and it was ready when we arrived. Owner was friendly when we ordered. 

We tried the sweet and sour pork with rice - it was crispy and tasty but had a bit too much batter.

Also tried the satay beef fried rice noodle which was a bit too saucy but overall good. 

We would come again as it was a good experience. 

Now that there is a full menu we look forward to trying other dishes.Absolutely terrible! Takes forever just to get seated even when there are plenty of open tables. They have 1 moron waitress wearing dirty pajamas,no busser or hostess. Food is marginal at best. They mess up the order and don't even care. And theres also some huge fat slob (I think the owner) who just sits there an eats and doesn't help seat people or do anything about the fact that te place is totally understaffed. Looking at the owner alone is enough to make someone lose their appetite. I'll never go back to this place!Little disappointed in this panda. Came in with a coupon buy a 2 plate entree and get an entree free. Ok well we bought 2 2plate entrees and should get an entree free. Ok so they charged us for a 3 plate, 2 plate and then the entree and then subtracted the coupon. So that's like an extra 2.75. Told the lady she was wrong and she tried to say it would be the same price. She was wrong, the manager gave us a $1 back. They spoke Spanish while doing the refund. Wonder what they were saying.This place is a hidden gem!!  Go early because they can run out nowadays with their growing popularity. Fav's include the meatloaf sammich and the pulled pork. Ribs and fries are amazing.  Great family run business. Keep it up guys!!Hello yelpers!!!!! A hidden gem awaits you inside Sam's town. Initially we went in for the big rib sale special that tgif's was running on Tv and we got more than we could have bargained for. Our waiter named Matt was great and provided excellent service. We ordered the ribs and steak and lobster. The food was tasty and filling. We were so impressed we signed up for the tgif's rewards app. We went back the following week and were treated like Vip's. Matt was excellent again and the manager Janet really did a great job with an irate low class customer who was next to us and was clearly out of line wanting to blame anyone and everyone except her ghetto self for of all things a lost phone charger. Any who, do yourself a favor and visit this location. They are open late and run a great steak and lobster special after 10 at night.  And then you can check out the mystic falls show after that or just enjoy a little Vegas roll of the dice!! And remember, the random element of chance always favors the prepared mind!!!I really wanted to like this place, since it's so close to my house. I was hoping its fried chicken really was that good, and that it could be our new go-to spot for barbecue. Sadly, that was not the case. 

The very first thing I noticed was that they had Tahitian Treat as a fountain drink, which made me super excited. They don't, however, have anything sugar free, or diet, which sucks for anyone diabetic or on a restrictive diet. That was the first issue. 

When we got to the restaurant, we were the only folks there. A few minutes after we sat down, a couple other tables were seated. I ordered the 3 piece fried chicken dinner, and mac n cheese and candied yams, the kiddo got chicken fingers and fries, and my partner got a pound of brisket. All pretty easy. 

An hour later we finally got our food. During that hour, all the other tables were served, and some had even eaten and left. My chicken was dry, and the sides were obviously Stouffers mac n cheese, and canned yams. The kiddo kept saying how hungry she was, but when her food came, she barely touched it. The brisket was tough, and we're pretty sure it was nowhere near an actual pound. 

We were all thoroughly disappointed. Our server kept our drinks full, but that was about it. Never apologised for the long wait, never said anything about everyone else being served way before us. 

I was really hoping for good things from here. I'm really sad it didn't come remotely close to meeting our expectations.I think the biggest plus is that they do not have a casino-which means the whole hotel is non smoking. Its new, clean, and their customer service is excellent. We had a small issue and they immediately made up for it.Flew into AZ for a week's worth of business, and the first place my client's dragged me to for lunch was Carolina's. I was not entirely sure if my stomach could handle all that traveling, and then eating food from a rather dicey looking place, but oh boy, was my stomach thanking me over and over again!

I have the Chicken Chimichanga with Guac and it was probably the best thing I have eaten in a very long time! Service was pretty fast considering the line that was growing by the minute. Food tasted great and was pretty darn cheap to boot! Needless to say, I was begging them to take me to Carolina's everyday for the next 5 days....oh what I would give to be able to eat this every single dayDelicious Peruvian restaurant. We come here a lot and have never being disappointed. The alfajores are the best. They also have salsa dancing during the weekends.Went to Ajo Al's because my parents love the place (they eat anything). We walked in and waited for someone to seat us and waited and waited and waited. A full 5 minutes later, no lie - it was 5 minutes, someone did finally come to us to ask if we were helped. We got to our table, we received 2 bowls of chips, all chips were tiny tiny, ya know the chips at the bottom of the bag. Looked like they didn't want to cook fresh chips so they served the crumbs that they had. Nevertheless, chips are chips so we still ate them. I ordered the cheese conqueso dip and when the server delivered it was very thin, almost a liquid consistency. I didn't want to say anything but my mom did and the waiter brought us shredded cheese that we added to the conqueso and made it right, ourselves (aren't we paying someone to do this for us?)

Anyway, besides everything that happened BEFORE getting our lunch, lunch was fabulous. Like always, their food is great. Maybe an off night? 

I would have rated it more but they need to work on a few things!

#1 customer service! especially in a society that is going through a recession.800 degrees is in the new SLS hotel.

we checked in and were starving. we ordered two pizzas (pesto and meat lovers) and a salad to carry out and eat at the pool. the food was quick (considering they make it in a wood fired oven), delicious, and piping hot. a little on the pricier side for pizza but none of the food in the SLS is cheap. they packed it up really nicely with utensils and cups of parmesean and hot pepper sauce.The WPH has been here for a few years, but for some reason we have never eaten here... until recently. We didn't wait long for our second trip to try the fish fry-

We sat at a table that was across the room from the fireplace, which made the room warm and cozy on a cold winters night. Both my wife and I went all in and both ordered the fried walleye. We don't usually do this, we typically like to share for more variety. Glad we didn't this time- I didn't want to share this succulent piece of crusty goodness!

The fish- it's flakey and perfectly encapsulates the large fillet with a fried cracker-ish crust that was seasoned quite well.   The accompanying tarter had a little kick that tastes like it has both horseradish and a touch of Sriracha... it's yummy!

The coleslaw was creamy- wish there were a little more on the plate. 

I got salad- vinaigrette dressing over mixed greens. 

Bonnie L got the sweet potato fries. They were not bad, but with how good everything else
Is, they could do better here

The beer selection is pretty legit here. I got a Duchesse de Bourgogne in the proper glass!!!  Only in Belgium have I been able to drink this on tap.  If you like sour beers, this is one of the best!

If you haven't been here- check it out!Don't waste your time and money if you're looking for REAL BBQ. The food here isn't even close to the real stuff. Went for Happy Hour and ordered the "burnt ends" $12.00, they weren't part of the Happy Hour deals. Not impressed at all. Asked for them without sauce. Any BBQ place that drowns  their meat in BBQ sauce is trying to hide something. The burnt ends didn't even have the faintest taste of smoke. They also have "fried gumbo" on the menu. Gumbo to me is a stew. This is their "twist"?? on gumbo. creative twist on a Southern favorite. Lightly battered fried shrimp, catfish and okra seasoned with Brady's rub and a side of ranch & bbq aioli.
Just not what I was looking for having been to other BBQ restaurants in the Valley.
Wish I could give this a better rating.Pork katsu curry... The best here. Priced like many other places I've been to that sell similar foods, but with twice as much meat. Definitely worth it. I always leave a tip!I was there for the first time today with my wife and kids the atmosphere pleasant the food was good and reasonable priced the sevece was good it was nice and clean my wife enjoyed the all you can eat chicken bar the music was very versatile.It would be a place I would go to again.On the lighter side I would look to go with out the kids so my wife and I could enjoy a couple cocktailsLoved the food and service and of course it's hard to be unhappy when eating poolside at the spa!  I tried the Thai chicken lettuce cups which was great to split.  Alsoo had a great salad and do not miss the chocolate fondue-great tasty fruit and cake to dip in a little chocolate pot-another one that is great to split.  The cocktails were very light, used fresh ingredients, and were refreshing - perfect.  The staff were very attentive and helpful, checking in to see if you need something without being pushy or annoying.Dennys is a Denny's! The wait can be a little long for a seat and paying since this store is located on the strip right by the MGM and New York, New York. I had the American Grand Slam and my girlfriend blue berry pancakes. All was delivered in a timely fashion.yum! Have visited this place a few times now and it's great every time. Quick service, good authentic mexican food. My favorite thing is it isn't extremely loud like most mexican restaurants tend to be. SO relieved to walk in and NOT see a mariachi band lol. Definitely check this place out if you want fast delicious Mexican foodI've been to Sweet Raku about four times now and this will be my last time.  

Charging $12 a dessert and skimping on the ingredients is totally unacceptable to me.  Instead of giving you three full pieces of raspberries, they cut it in half so you get three half pieces of raspberries.  Really? 

The foie gras, instead of full pieces as shown in the menu and how it was served before as you can see from other Yelper pics, they also give you half pieces.  I should've known by then and take caution with this place but I didn't learn my lesson until this time.

This time I ordered the caviar ($30 for 10g).  It came tin unsealed, caviar was loosely packed with a thin layer that seems like they have took out some instead of it densely packed like how a tin or jar of caviar should be packed.  You can even compare my pic with other Yelper pic how it was much fuller in the past than mine.

Quality totally gone down as I saw the baker put together the dessert quite sloppily and fed no passion.  Huge contrast from the first couple times I went.  The wait time for the caviar was long perhaps they need to bake the puff pastries.  

It's the little thing that some customers pay attention to that the eateries often think the customers pay no notice to.  Unfortunately I am one of those customers who pays attention on details.Very good food with very good service.everytime we go there we are always greeted well.i specially recommend the natukudi biryani.is awesome and so is the mutton biryani.i have been ther for dinner as well as buffet and both were up to the mark . This branch is so much better than the other peacock branch .thumbs upAnother gem on Roosevelt. We went simple with drip coffee and toasts which were exceptional. The friendly, welcoming staff made our first visit a great experience and we cant wait to go back. Great place, check it out!Stopped in for Cinco DE drinko. Long line. They told us it was going to be a 30 minute wait. After only 15 minutes we were in. The food was great. Our waiter Monty was attentive, professional and very friendly. The manager stopped by. We were not hurried and received excellent service.Have your wedding here!  Nadine is awesome, the food is awesome, and the venue is beautiful. You get a lot of bang for your buck too. We just had our wedding there and would do it again in a heartbeat.I enjoy this McDonald's by my work. It's always clean and lines go pretty fast. I have never had to wait a really long period for my food and the cashiers are always friendly.Got the turkey burger with sweet potato fries and boy, it was quite delicious! I tried the Hawaiian bliss and that was flavorful, as well. I can't wait to try the entire menu! Customer service is beyond my expectations, super friendly and personable.I think maybe 3 years ago, this would have gotten a 4 from me. There are just too many ramen shops around town now. But I will point out that the food here is good. I do come here pretty regularly. There's just something different about the place that I can't put my finger on it (from how it was 3 years ago). The atmosphere, the vibe, just seems different walking into it now than from before.

Oh and also, the menu used to be constructed so that I could walk in and say pork belly, spicy garlic broth, rich or regular (a three step process). Now it's a 6 or 7 step process. I don't know how I feel about this paradox of choice. I'm an eater not a thinker.

But anyway, I consider ramen soul food for some reason (anything in broth\/soup is soul food to me =). And so I can always go and eat a bowl or ramen. And that's probably why I do eat here regularly. I like their spicy garlic soup the most (and in fact, I'm sure I haven't had any of the other soup)...I don't like change. If it works and if it makes me happy, I stick with it. It's not spicy, by the way. It is pretty good though. One down side to spicy garlic is that no one wants to come near me after I eat here, but it's worth it! 

The shop is some what small (I find it interesting that other reviewers have said it's pretty large). It's a long shop, and has a bench table up front near the door. Then two areas of bar seatings. And then I think maybe two or three small tables in the back? (If that many). If you can visualize that, you can probably see that it's not particularly big...ANyway, the point of this is that depending on the time of the day (for example, lunch time), you might have to wait to get a seat, especially if you are with a group.Before our son came along, my husband and I went to Emeril's fish house in Las Vegas for dinner.   The service was excellent, we were treated like royalty (really!) and the food was sinfully delicious.  Presentation was simple, even homey and service was very attentive without being pretentious.   We topped off our meal with the multi-tiered banana cream pie which is worth having even if you're so full and can't take another bite!  I only wish we can go again so I'm a bit leery reading some of the previous reviews.They have a good variety on the menu, from oven wood oven baked pizza's to Osso Bucco.  Try the Mamma meatball slider to start!  Went on a saturday night, it was busy, so i can get noisy.Finally, a place to get cronuts everyday! Not just after 9:00 am or just weekends. Love the idea of pettit cronuts.  You get many favors (doz) for $6. Great. Other food is good, but their pastries are great.Slightly pricey, but worth it.  Bachi burger blends a unique fusion of Hawaiian, American, and Japanese flavors into gourmet burgers and other dishes. Their food is fresh, delicious, and unlike any burger you've ever tasted. Too expensive to be a regular stop, but good enough to be an occasional treat, even though they are on the other side of town from me.Great food and big portions !
I had chicken gyro and my partner had 
The lamb one   We could not finish it 
We ate salads before the sandwiches that 
Were good too.  Great service 
Place was very clean   We took dessert home
I had the bread pudding  and my partner had the 
Baklava.   Both were delicious!
We highly recommend this restaurant !I never knew food could taste like this. I seriously will never be able to eat at another BBQ place again. When standards are THIS HIGH, how do you pay for ok, or 'decent' bbq again? This was our last big eat in Las Vegas and I'm telling you, we should've eaten here every damn day and not wasted our time on anything else!!! I first found out about this place from a YouTuber I love, and had it bookmarked almost a year ago. I'm glad I remembered to check it out! We ubered here from the Bellagio which was about a ten minute drive, then ordered almost everything! We got a three meat plate and I think it's called the big Dave, a sandwich with brisket, pulled pork and hot links. I added Chipotle slaw and do yourself a favor and ADD IT TO YOUR SANDWICHES! OH MY GOD, my mouth is salivating. The meat was so tender, so caramelized on the outside and just melted in your mouth. Their BBQ sauce is PERFECT.

Seriously, I drowned my food in that BBQ sauce and wanted to plug it into an IV. Their mustard sauce and spicy bbq were great too, and when we ordered our food and found a table I saw a guest eating the moistest piece of cornbread I've ever seen. I went right back to the counter and ordered some! THE MOST PERFECT CORNBREAD IN THE WORLD. Went great with the other 6 sides we ordered! Meat fell RIGHT off the bone on the ribs when you used a fork! Not too tender to be a mess, but perfect in that once your teeth touch the smoked exterior of each rib, the meat comes right off. This will be my last meal before I die. You guys are geniuses, absolutely wonderful.Had white pizza and chicken fingers. Family enjoyed meal. Cute, cozy, clean little restaurant. Friendly staff.I'm from The South, where fried chicken is pretty much sacred, so I take my bird seriously. But I can honestly say Lo-Lo's is the best fried chicken in Phoenix. It is everything you need your chicken to be: tender, moist and juicy with a flavorful, crispy crust. Om nom nom.

The other thing I love about Lo-Los is the Kool Aid. They serve it to you in a big 'ol mason jar, and it makes you feel like a kid again. If you want, you can even get a cocktail that's made with Kool Aid. So fun.

Service is good. Food is incredi-balls. The new Scottsdale location has gorgeous decor (major upgrade from the old one!)

Long live Lo-Los and your juicy wonder chicken!Contrary to the info on Yelp, Nostrano is open for lunch.  While the menu is more limited than dinner, it has many of the same options, but a whole lot cheaper.  The whitefish sandwich and the smoked pork shank sandwich we had were superb!  They come with a delicious salad of mixed greens and baby veggies.  I'll definitely be back!Excellent service, reasonable prices, very tasty food, great portions. There's nothing not to like about this place. It's a greasy spoon, but that's what you expect. Drunk food at its finest.Duck fat fries are awesome. The torta rustica is good but it has quite a bit of cheese. Service was prompt and friendly.I'm new to Ramen so I tried a few different Ramen places and Morris Ramen stood out! The flavor was distinct and separate from all the ingredients, not all infused together. Sapporo on tap was a plus and the music was soft 70s stuff that made the meal.Nice place!!Had a fettuccine Alfredo, and then the disappointment, ton of garlic powder. For 20bucks you don't expect this. i suffered the entire night afterwards, done with Kit KatJust ate here for the first time and it was amazing! I got the pulled pork and my fiancé got the Philly cheesesteak burger. Oh my, was everything incredible! This was such a great find... It is the perfect hole in the wall place. Not the best area and it's a small shop but fresh amazing food and lots of great choices! We also loved the huge selection of soda pop. We will definitely be back and bring friends! Highly recommend.Used Yelp to find this place for a quick bite. Wow! Burgers were awesome and the side order of beans delicious. A new favorite!I had high hopes for this place but was disappointed. The workers seemed snooty. Blueberry lemon drop and superfood salad were good. The bruschetta was TERRIBLE!  I got the ribeye bruschetta and it was like boiled beef in bad gravy. I exchanged it for the mushroom bruschetta, which was very plain sautéed  mushrooms and onions.  I'll go again for the martini but wont waist my money on the food.Where's the meat?" 
This place used to be a regular for me for years, until one day I ordered hunan chicken take-out. Bottom line, meat was almost non exsistent. Mostly veggies but litle tiny strips of chicken I could barely find. Very skimpy. I called to inquire if they mistakenly gave me a veggie dish, and I was they pre-measure the amount of meat in their dishes. Went to another chinese restaurant that was a little cheaper AND with HUGE chunks of chicken!. Since then, I have decided since I like meat I haven't gone back.wow.. so words cannot even describe the amaze-balls of this restaurant. legit Thai cuisine.. well cooked, well portioned, ambience was soothing, and great location. I ordered the shrimp sauteed with eggplant, which was spicy.. #18 on the menu and it was sooo goood!!! i can't even! i highly recommend this place... i wish they had thai iced tea to complete the whole Thai inspiration theme... bon apetit!Steak disappointing but parmesan chicken good.  Salad blah.4\/5! Very authentic and fresh Italian food! Recommend the sausage fettuccini and most of the apps are great! Cute atmosphereAte here from a Groupon!   This place lets you build whatever you want on a burger practically.  The order sheet is huge.  It's a great concept as long as you can be decisive haha.

I had a Bacon Cheeseburger with BBQ sauce on the amazing brioche bun and it was great.  The french fries we ordered were half sweet potato\/half regular and they were awesome.

Speaking of which....they have a dipping sauce with the sweet potato fries that is made out of marshmallow and together it's like candied yams on Thanksgiving.

All in all this is a pretty good burger joint :)DO NOT COME TO THIS PLACE, ESPECIALLY WITH YOUR KIDS. 
DO NOT ALOW YOUR TEENAGE DAUGHTERS TO WORK OR EAT HERE.

It's absolutely amazing to me that this place is still in business. After telling my little girl to "Shut up, kid!" when she asked about an ice cream flavor, the owner then proceeded to make lewd comments about sexual things he wanted to do to me IN FRONT OF MY KID!!!!! How disturbing is that?!

I filed a complaint with the Macedonia police department and was told they get similar complaints of sexual harassment about the owner on a regular basis. WHAT THE HECK!!!!! 

Thanks, but no thanks. There are plenty of other places to get a burger and some ice cream in the area. Try Burger Fresh in Brecksville, and then go across the street for some Honey Hut Ice Cream. Don't support a sexual predator.One of my favorite new spots. The food is delicious and they even offer a decent amount of vegan and vegetarian options too. I've tried almost everything on the menu and it's always good. The service can be a little disorganized sometimes but the quality of the food and presentation make up for it. This is my go to spot.Awesome views of the Vegas Valley from the balcony! The service is great and the food is good. They can accommodate large party's in the private room too.First time visitors, didn't realize that it wasn't full service, so p;aced order at front desk, two breakfasts came to $28.00, (extra charge for bacon) on to coffee distribution area coffee luke warm had to find someone to nuke coffee for us. After getting our food mediocre to say the least, certainly not worth the price.Will say the staff was very nice and pleasant .Really excellent restaurant with a wide variety of japanese and Malaysian cuisine. Delicious flavors, interesting and exotic food. Got a lot of food today, but found the soups to be the best! Sushi is also very freshAAAAAAMAZZZING!!!!! The best overall breakfast experience that I have ever had. Here's why: 
1. Proper flatware. Not that cheap junk that overpriced , low quality restaurants usually use.
2. NonGMO ketchup
3. Homemade preserves for the homemade bread.
4. Myers soap in the restrooms
5. Waffles to die for with real maple syrup
So much more but who wants to read all that? Matt's BIG Breakfast IS the best this fussy, Non GMO, organic, frugal, prefers to eat at home Gal has ever eaten!!!This is one of those hidden gems in town.  Everything about this place was amazing.  The service was great and the server was really nice. He helped us ordered by telling us what was his favorite.  I had the gnocchi with their vodka sauce. It was amazing.  My friend and I also shared their meatballs. Do not skip out on the meatballs they are really really tasty.  Overall this place is amazing and I will be bringing alot of my friends back.  A truly hidden gem.If you are prepared to wait, Emma's has a delicious brunch. On Sunday, the wait was around 45mins\/1 hr for a table around 10am. Be warned, the wait continues after you are seated. The server actually told us she couldn't take our order because there were too many tables ahead of us. More help is needed! You will also be slightly cramped since the spot is small - especially if you are at one of the tiny bar height tables as my husband and I were when we first came here. If you can look past these things, you won't be disappointed by the food. The eggs Benedict comes on their amazing, buttery biscuits. I suggest taking some to go. The donuts are also great, but it is a shame they are only available on the weekends! We tried the bacon maple - yum. Since I was starving by the time we ordered on Sunday, I ordered the "I know what you did last night burger". The patty was made from breakfast sausage and was really flavourful. We grabbed a cottage pie from the freezer to eat for dinner. It was tasty, but some of the vegetables had a pickled taste. I didn't care for it, but it wouldn't stop me from picking up another frozen meal from them. Emma's has a good concept with the frozen food at the back and bakery at the front. I think they need a bigger location and more help! More people need to try their amazing food!This is my new favourite Thai restaurant. The menu has a great variety and you can choose your spice level of any dish - great for those like me, who can't handle spice! 

We came here for dinner on a Saturday night with a group of 12. The wait was over an hour but thankfully there is a bar upstairs. My boyfriend and I started with the fresh spring rolls. These were nothing to write home about, some chicken and veg rolled in rice paper. 

For the main I ordered the red curry with mild spice. Best Thai curry I've ever had - hands down. It was a good size portion, had great flavour and tender chicken. They could have thickened the sauce a little more, but the flavour was so spot on that the thickness was a minor detail. 

I can't wait to come back and try something else on the menu!This review is for Emporio.

I came here on a double date on a Thursday night. We arrived at 6 and the place was busy but not filled to capacity. They told us a 20-30 minute wait (which I didn't understand b\/c I could clearly see 2 open tables that would have fit us) but it ended up being more like a 5-10 minute wait.

I was able to try a decent amount of menu items:
Poutine: I opted for the tater tots (you can also get regular fries) topped w\/ mushroom gravy (other options were chicken gravy and any of the sauces they put on their meatballs) and cheese curds. This was a decent sized portion for $7. It was pretty tasty though on the salty side.
Pepperoni Fritters: Meh. I couldn't taste any pepperoni in these fritters which was super disappointing. Why are these named pepperoni fritters if there is ZERO pepperoni flavor. It tasted like fried cheese w\/ a side of marinara.
Fried Pickles: Yummy and huge portion but you can only eat so many pickles in one sitting :P
Meatball Grinders: I got the turkey meatballs topped w\/ almond pesto sauce and smoked gouda. My boyfriend got the spicy pork meatballs topped w\/ creamy parmesan sauce and provolone. I thought the turkey meatballs were on the dry side and lacked flavor, and that the pork meatballs were decent but not mindblowing. There were 3 meatballs in each sandwich. The bread was bland and boring. It was a very average meatball sandwich.

My boyfriend and I also got 2 glasses of beer for him ($7.50 each) and a glass of sauvignon blanc for me ($10). Prices to be expected for a downtown restaurant.

Also, I had contemplated getting the 4 meatball option but unfortunately they don't allow mixing so you're stuck w\/ 4 of the same meatballs\/sauces. Sucks b\/c it would be a great way to try all 4 of their meatball options. I don't think you can mix on the sandwiches either. If you want to try all 4 meatballs you would have to order 4 individual sliders which are $3.50 each.

Overall, the food was underwhelming. In all honesty, if it were closer to where I live, I may revisit...but it just isn't worth the trip to downtown Pittsburgh.It's important to mention that this location is not a Michelin-rated restaurant - the location in Tokyo is the one that is recognized. With that being said, the standards have certainly brought its way to the Toronto location. If you love seafood flavour, then you will certainly love this ramen. Although its ~$2 more expensive than your regular ramen, I feel that the quality is worth that extra costs. The truffle oil really brings out the flavours and adds an extra richness that I haven't tasted in other ramens. 

I think that its worth trying this place at least once - to experience the Michelin-endorsed restaurant and the unique clam broth.Mediocre experience at 5S17. I stumbled across this prime real estate spot in the heart of 17th ave, and I decided to give it a shot. The layout of the restaurant is pretty cool and there is a patio, which is a huge plus for summer days. 

The ramen itself, however, is mediocre at best. The noodles felt lower quality, and the broth was only passable. Not a terrible choice in a pinch, but with so many options on 17th ave, I wouldn't see myself coming back unless I really wanted ramen. Overall, passable, and not terrible if you want to people watch from the patio in the summer.I came to Lebowski's randomly with a friend. Parking (as with most of Dilworth) can be quite a bear. They have a parking lot, but it's really tight. I like that there is a patio, so that is nice to sit outside. Overall, the food was okay. I really enjoyed the sweet potato tater tots. Other than that, I wasn't super impressed with the food. It's a nice place to hang out with a lot of TVs, so good for watching games.

Another big perk was they allowed my dog to sit on the patio.I typically hate buffets but all my cousins wanted to go to this one because it was the go-to brunch buffet in Vegas. After reading about this place on Yelp, we decided to try to get to the Buffet around 11 am so we could eat by noon. 

Since we had a group of six, we were brought over to a different line that was separated from the people with five or fewer people. From there we just had to wait to pay and then to be seated. For some reason, the hostess got nervous when we said we wanted to pay separately, but it seemed like we would be seated faster (we skipped a couple of groups in line) because my cousin put everything on her card, the buffett (with free mimosas and Champagne) came out to about $65 each.

We were seated in a booth - which was very nice because we couldn't really hear the others in the dining area and we were able to easily get in and out of our booth without disturbing anyone else. 

Now for the food:
I had about 5 mimosas and 4 plates of food.

I started off with a "breakfast" plate - which included red velvet cupcakes, chicken and waffle fries, hash browns, bacon, macaroni and cheese, squash, and a slider. 

My next plate was primarily from the Asain section - lo mein, spring rolls, chicken and other various noodles

My third plate included one taco, a iceburg blue cheese wedge salad (lunch items started appearing since we ate so long), more macaroni and cheese,  and more hashbrowns. 

For desserts I took a bunch of little things including - a pecan tart, creme brule, a strawberry eclair, strawberry short cake, gelato, and fudge.

I skipped over the seafood section and pizza section because I do not like seafood and....why eat pizza.

I was very impressed with how clean and tasty everything was and how quickly the plates were picked up. There was only one time I had to ask for additional champagne was towards the end of the meal.I am giving a bad review because I would love the cooks to speak english. I have ordered from this location a few times, and when they make an error I have tremendous difficulty talking with the cook who made my pizza because his english is so poor. They should change the name of this pizza pizza to "India Pizza" because all the employees are indian. And I mean brand new to the country. The manager\/owner of this location takes money from the employees if a customer complains about their pizza. I'm pretty sure that is illegal, but the new immigrants\/refugees here are not educated enough to call the ministry of labour. This is a sad sad place to work. I feel sorry for the employees, but I am upset they cannot speak english. And they keep putting on the wrong type of sauce and cheese on my pizzas! Why can't the owner\/manager just hire high school kids like McDonald's instead? I guess high school kids know about their rights.Made-from-scratch beef pies and pork pies are amazing! The dumplings and garlic eggplant with pork were also very good. The noodle dishes were okay but are not the main attraction. Food prices are very affordable. This place is great to head to with a group of 3-4 so you can all try a little of everything. The orders of 3 pies can be increased to orders of 4, just don't be afraid to ask if desired. Service typically leaves something to be desired but you're there for the food. It's worth driving out of your way to head here. I've been here twice and will be back again soon.We purchased package with v tickets.  Buffet food was passable and high pressure sales environment. Ok for quick meal before the show but don't expect much. Be cautious with up selling.We went here tonight as a family. It was GREAT! Service was fantastic, friendly & welcoming & all the food was very good. I wish I knew all the names of the dishes but they didn't stick in my head. My husband & I had a lemongrass chicken dish on rice - wonderful.   Our son had beef skewers which he devoured & our other son had Shrimp & beef on noodles. It was all delicious & the prices are inexpensive! We'll put this on our places to come back too!I came here yesterday after a great weekend celebrating a friend's bachelor party. With 4 of us left, it only took about 20 mins to get a table.

The portions here are huge and the prices to match. If you don't want to leave in a stretcher or get a doggie bag, I would recommend sharing a plate. Two of my friends go the chicken and waffles, which were 2 giant chicken breasts with 4 bacon waffles. and we're not talking fluffy light waffles, we're talking batter dense waffles. I got the Chicken, potatoes, eggs, and bacon with a biscuit.  that was also very good.  the chicken has a great seasoning on it and lots of moisture, especially for the breast meat. potatoes had (I think) grilled mozzerella in them, which was cool.  The biscuit was surprisingly a little on the dry chalky side, but they had some nice jam and butter to help that.

If the portions were smaller and prices lower to match, it would definitely be 5 stars, but the portions and prices were just a little to ridiculous for me. But I guess that's Vegas? or maybe the expanding waistline of America.called ahead and took our dogs here. they set up the outside patio for us along with many water bowls for all the pooches. 

All I ate was their desert pizza cookie which was just ok. the bread they bring out as a complimentary snack was yummy though so I'm excited to try their actual food next time I go.

Nice place and friendly service.I'm a semi-frequent Wingstop shopper. I travel quite a bit and need a wing fix frequently. Wingstop is usually a safe option.  I have to say, I almost drove further to another location due to the poor reviews at this location. I'm sure they're all valid but I can only rate my single experience at this location which was great.

I pre-ordered online to hopefully minimize any "mistakes" during order placement. It said 18 minutes till my order was ready. I showed up at 20 minutes and the food was surprisingly ready! There were a few people waiting on a Wednesday evening. Overall, the place seemed empty, but the kitchen was quite busy. 

They didn't double check the order while I was there. Everything was neatly stacked in the bag. There wasn't any excessive oil. I took a chance and walked out. Checked on my food in the hotel room and everything was piping hot and perfect. No complaints here!

In summary, I'd come back to this location out of convenience despite poor reviews by others. Hopefully the reason things were good for me were due to a correction from management.This place came highly recommended for good fish. Having experienced illness from dirty restaurants, I don't care how good it taste I pass. I couldn't see in the kitchen, but first impressions countI must say first, very quick and friendly service.  The problem with this pizza joint, is the pizza.  It was a thicker dough stingy amount of sauce and the small amount of cheese was burnt making it a hard plastic layer that covered the pizza.  I wish I could keep supporting them but just a lousy product.Best cob salad! Great beer selection. Meatloaf amazing.I have been to Butterfield's several times when visiting Scottsdale, and I can't think of anywhere else in the U.S. where I would rather have breakfast.  The service and food are consistently excellent.  

I usually order the same thing because it contains everything I want.  I get the California Scramble, made with EggBeaters.  This contains bacon, avocado, cheese, tomato, and order of perfectly-browned hash browns, and two pancakes.  Yummy!  

Also, I always have the iced tea.  It is perfect!  Come to find out, they use filtered water and they brew a batch about every fifteen minutes (the teamaster overheard me and my boyfriend discussing the tea and filled us in on the details.)  Ask for a to-go cup when you're ready to leave.  

Service is polite and quick.  No complaints here.

If you like breakfast, Butterfield's is a must-try when you're in Scottsdale.  They also have lunch\/brunch menu, but I have never tried anything on it.  No need to when I have the perfect breakfast every time!Great coffee, and the best chocolate chip cookie in the city. Cool hangout - relaxed, hip, young, but not terribly noisy - so quite the pleasant spot. I want to try their mont-royal location too!Great coffee. Amazing outdoor space.  Wish I could come here more often -- maybe next time I'm in Toronto.  Highly recommended!Nice pizza thanks, I was able to personally customize my pizza which was a great experience for me! Down to earth manager and good side optionsI can't put my finger on it, but for some reason, I don't like this location as much as the other two.  It has something to do with the atmosphere.  The burger and fries tasted the same...very good. One great thing is that it wasn't nearly as busy as the original location, so it had immediate seating.Nice attendant and quick service. Due to someone being allergic to quite a few things, we had to ask for an order that was certainly customized quite a bit. The staff had no problem working with us. Thank you!As a person of Caribbean background, it's difficult finding good Caribbean food in Cleveland. I'm so glad to have been introduced to Irie Patties, the food is always on point!I had high expectations of Buca from all the amazing things I have heard of it. 

PROS:
- Impeccable service; Our server was very friendly and informative; She made our overall  experience excellent 
- The vibe is accessible, welcoming and casual - not over-the-top formal; I am interested in eating good food, not having to spend 45 minutes in front of a mirror worrying if my outfit is appropriate for a restaurant. Buca has a open vibe in that regard for a restaurant at its price point. 
- Polenta: Must have! An incredibly delicious side
- Fresh, high quality ingredients 

CONS:
- Four of us had different mains and thus, had the opportunity to try various dishes. Overall, the food was very fresh, quality ingredients, I did not find the flavours to have a punch or exciting taste. The dishes were quite subdued in flavour. For the price point, I had higher expectations and some of the dishes (two of the pastas in particular) tasted a bit generic.Food was good. The decoration and vibe was really cool also!! Unfortunately food and drinks came out wrong and it took forever to get anything. The waitress seemed really overwhelmed and the hostess was beyond rude when our group asked for a picture. Would love to try this place again, they have a really cool looking outdoor space, and they are right near voodoo brewery so it's a nice spot for a night out.A bit pricey and very long waiting lines, an hour and a half. I noticed a line for casino players, who walked right in and made us wait longer. 
I was not impressed with the food, for the price. 
The floor was wet and I almost fell.
The Aria buffet is a better deal.I've been visiting this particular Lone Star quite often and have always enjoyed the food and the service. Also whenever I go it's not crowded and I like that.

The food is great and this Lone Star is very consistent in its quality. I order my steaks medium-rare and they're always cooked to the exact same standard.

For appetizers their Lone Star skins are amazing. Crispy with soft starchy potato and cheese, just perfect. The Taste of Texas sampler is a pretty big plate and has Lone Star Skins, Buffalo Chicken Tenders and Onion Rings. 
The Texas Rose is a huge onion  cut and deep fried like a rose. It is very heavy and while it might look good it's sheer size and greasiness only make it viable for parties of 6+ people.

Their salads are nothing extraordinary but their ranch dressing is perfect: tangy and creamy, I wish I could buy it in the grocery store!

 The steaks themselves are quite tasty and very juicy. I wasn't very impressed with the Porterhouse, It is a big steak but wasn't as tasty as I expected. It does fill you up though and you can't go wrong with it.

My top 3 choices are:

San Antonio sirloin for a relatively lean steak

Peppercorn Ribeye has an amazing sauce and the ribeye itself is very tasty

Five Star Filler mignon: probably the leanest cut they have, this is very tender and juicy.

You get to order 2 side dishes with your steak. Most of them are excellent.

With steak I always get the baked sweet potato with cinnamon-sugar and butter, it is a divine combination and i highly recommend it,  in fact I always have this with my steak!, Simple: YOU MUST HAVE IT!.

The lettuce wedge is a nice addition too, it has just the right amount of blue cheese  in the dressing to spice up the letttuce.

Creamed Spinach was somewhat bitter when I ordered it. I'd prefer it "creamier".

The mashed potatoes are lacking in taste somehow, they don't have that starchy creamy taste. Make sure you get it with bacon and cheese, makes a huge difference.

For dessert, the big brownie they have is extremely indulgent, it is a big size, easily feeds 3 people (maybe more) and the classic combination of the hot moist brownie with the cold ice cream makes this dessert the highlight of your Lone Star experience.

Every time the service has been amazing, when I go to Lone Star I usually have a certain server who has proved to be the most friendly and attentive I have seen in the valley so far. I'm not sure if Yelp allows to write a server's name so I can't mention who he is. Definitely A+ for service.

Overall a traditional steakhouse with good quality and consistent food, great service and decent prices. How can you go wrong?We have had so many great experiences here but tonight was just terrible in every which way. My steak salad came horribly overcooked (MW to Well as opposed to the Med-Rare I had ordered) not once but twice. When the manager came to my table after the 2nd steak was recognized by the server to be overcooked, I told her I'd just eat what I had because I'm not one for wasting food and I was dining with my young kids who weren't going to have patience for a third chance. She said "I'll take care of it". I assumed that meant that some portion of my bill would be forgiven as an act of goodwill but alas, I was mistaken. As I finished my meal, a 3rd steak came to my table to "correct the issue". When I said that it made no sense to have steak delivered after finishing the meal I had, the steak was returned to the kitchen. In the meantime, my server only appeared when I asked other servers to find him, and general communication between the staff was clearly poor - no one seemed to know what was going on. Through the missing server and general confusion, the restaurant managed to make 2 kids meals and a salad translate to an hour and a half dining experience. Even with that duration, my drink wasn't refilled or refreshed even once. Despite all of this, I paid full price for my meal and the manager on duty defended her staff, told me she was "sorry", and then stood and stared at me until I left. It's a shame that the experience was so terrible because the food is quite good, but I can't imagine going back. There are many other choices in Huntersville at this price point that still offer customer service as part of the experience.6 months ago I bought a chicken burrito here and it contained some unknown substance,  I e-mailed the company and they responded quickly. Sent me fee coupons. I went again this week ordered a steak burrito, it contained  grisely meat with no taste. I think it's time to find somewhere else for burritos.The fried calamari was 5 stars! Caesar Salad and Eggplant Parmesan appetizers were 3 stars. Overall score of 3.5 stars rounded up to 4 stars.Really outstanding place here! The bread was amazing! The food was amazing! Aaron our server was on point. And the bathrooms even have hot water. I was thrilled  One of the best overall restaurant experiences I've ever had.Very quaint whole in the wall place. Cool bar to the left and venue to straight ahead. I've been in a few times and the staff is very friendly.I do note  PHOENOMINAL excellent service by the waitstaff and manager and waitstaff that wasn't even ours. They did truly work as a team. Our group was made to feel Welcome Here.

I guess I have to start with the breadsticks. They give you bunches of them like it's raining breadsticks. Not all but most of the people at my table liked them but I thought they tasted a frozen dough product. One bite was enough for me as I didn't taste real garlic or a tasty oil on them.

The salad was sort of average with a what seemed like bottled dressing on it. They give you all you want and grate cheese on it for you.

I had the Apricot Chicken that's on the new Healthy Menu. The chicken wasn't as bad as that spongy Subway kind of chicken. I'm not sure if it was precooked and reheated or just over marinated because of the odd texture. It didn't taste fresh cooked but might have been. It seemed like it was cooked in a press of some sort. The asparagus and broccoli were nice and fresh but 100% unseasoned and just steamed. This dish tasted salt free and was slightly sweet.

My husband had a Shrimp and pasta dish. The shrimp were the small ones and the pasta was overdone.

I'd say if you are a fan of frozen TV dinners you will love the food here because it's a notch better with excellent service.I have been coming here for a few years and the food is always fresh and the restaurant is clean.  Friendly staff and plenty of choices for all tastes.  For a buffet one of the best I have been to.Decor was beautiful.
Menu had variety.
Server was nice and gave us a pastry when we mentioned it was our first visit.

My carnitas omelet was cold in the center- and the side of toast was dry and cold, not to mention tiny. Should have been included in cost of breakfast. The coffee was almost $3 for a cup, which felt unreasonable for portion size and quality. 

All in all way over priced for what was offered, and the quality of the food didn't live up to the decor.This place surprised my husband and I. We went one night wanting to try something new and had little to no expectations for this place. We ordered the chicken peanut sauce satay and a BBQ pizza with some appetizer fries. Everything was awesome. The staff was super attentive. They have a range of dishes that will fit in to whatever type of food\/price you are aiming for. An odd mix of Thai and American that somehow works perfectly for them. I highly recommend giving them a shot, you shouldn't leave disappointed!I'm surprised this place doesn't have better review stars. Very good Mexican food near us. We go super late and they always come through with great meals. I recommend the carne asada quesadilla and their tacos.A hidden gem look past the cheesy green and yellow paint on the walls and all the fake plants surrounding the place the food is amazingly delicious.this place stays busy it's always a full house and you know what that means good ass food !! FYI CASH ONLYMy new favorite sushi place all the fish is fresh and I get a sushi burrito with no rice because I try to cut down on the carbsThe place is very clean and has very friendly staff. The food was not top shelf. Had menudo and it seemed old and the meat was dark..like when it's been frozen and unfrozen. Not impressed.Along Yonge Street, just south of Finch, this place can be tough to locate with all the bright signs and restaurant, bars and grocery stores that are around it. 
However if you're lucky to stumble upon this place, its truly quaint once you go up the stairs (that I almost tripped on).

The ambiance is Cute, warm, wood all over.  It almost feels like you're in a restaurant situated in the middle of a park or forest.  No doubt a great place to bring friends and chill out.  If you're into Korean Pop music they've got two big televisions to keep you eyes occupied whilst waiting for your meal. 

Since us two were only here for dessert Jen suggested we try their Chocolate chip and green tea saved ice.  Once this beautifully presented dish arrived, I was speechless.Out of all the shaved ice places I've been to thus far, this was the best.  Its not surprise this hidden gem is doing so well.  

Definitely a great place to go, if you can find it.
Parking can be limited in this area since its among so many restaurants and grocery stores.Frozen pretzel sticks served frozen. Dry calamari. Hour wait. Go here if you don't know where to find good food because at least you might not get food poisoning. Please rename Burntfood tavern. Fish and chips was frozen. Inedible slaw. There was hair in my burnt steak. I could probably play basketball with the potatoes. The servers are nice. Fix your management problem. On a scale of one to ten it's a :(I liked La Famiglia. Located in a somewhat dying strip mall corner, the night I spent at the restaurant was pretty busy. Our server was really great, offering order advice for those of us visiting for the first time. They are known for their strombolis, which looked huge and really delicious. I ordered the house lasagne and was not disappointed. They make homemade garlic bread, and do a great job keeping the basket full throughout the meal. They have a pretty decent kids menu, comprised mostly of Italian dishes. Our daughter liked their spaghetti, and the portion was very large. 

I'm a big supporter of local businesses so I would recommend a visit to La Famiglia if you are in the mood for a great Italian meal at a nice, casual stop.I Had to wait 1 hour to seat, another hour for the food, but the food is delicious, hamburger was great and natchos was really yummy! I think  he should open another location , so it would not be so crazy busy, it is the reason i give 4 stars not 5, because the wait is a joke.Great atmosphere, awesome sushi and quick service. Brent was amazing, witty and I too of his game. Would come back anytime!This place is awesome! Great food, great vibe, good service if you're looking different and modern in the west lake area.It's ok place to eat! But their Banana bread is delicious! They are basically a regular type of breakfast place. Nothing special.I absolutely love Gordon's. The atmosphere is really chill. I come here about once a week  with a group of friends and never had a bad experience. It's really cool that we keep getting the same waitress and she knows my drink order. They have the best Reverse happy hour 9-cl. $5 cocktails a handful to choice from. $3.50 in house beers and $2.00 off a glass of wine. (I had 2 glasses myself ) yummy! Anyways great place to come to and Lindsay the waitress is awesome.I can't say enough wonderful things about the food quality at this restaurant for the price!  I've had dinner there three times  this week and the filet is simply amazing.  I had my first sample of Cholla Steakhouse 12 years ago and although I don't gamble, I will keep coming back again and again for the filet.  I think I know what dinner is going to be tonight :)Amazing experience came in grabbed a menu and ordered drinks came out a little while and since the food took a little longer chef sent over brioche which was amazing. Food came out soon after looking pretty appetizing will visit again if ever in the area!!We visited the Chayo Mexican Kitchen last week while in Vegas and we had a great experience with our waiter Kyle! He was awesome!I worked here back in 2011... and was able to try most of their dishes... so I am soley reviewing on the food ONLY.

Haven't been here since 2012...so I'm not sure if the menu has changed but...
Things to try\/order:
-crispy rolls, cheese rolls
-crying tiger: the green sauce is to die for!! Dip your meat in it!
-spicy noodles: similar to pad see ew w\/diff veggies &sauce
-tom yum:
-pad see ew
-pad thai: automatically comes w\/tofu so add diff protein!
-spicy fried rice & pineapple fried rice
-spicy beef salad
-papaya salad
-mango with sticky rice

These were all my favorite appetizers & dishes at Thai Basil.
I really like how you can pick your level of spice.  I love love love spicy food and can handle my spice very well.. I would usually go with medium or medium+ (btwn medium & hot)  
I don't recommend going Thai hot...because that stuff is literally fire!!! 

Parking is kind of limited...I remember one summer, the restaurant would get so packed... there were actually customers waiting!Crowdy but still very quick in delivering my order. Waiters finally smiling.
The food is very good, fries seem to be let greasy so...different taste but they are good.
I'll go back to this place againI love this place!  Everything is excellent!  My favorites are the Fattoush Salad, Humous, and Baba Ghanoush. Pita is always fresh and delicious. Even better is the service. The staff goes out of their way to welcome you and interact, making you feel at home. Five stars!Tried this place after a Cavs game and was very happy.  Their wings appetizer was very unique (not anything close to traditional wings).  Very crispy with no bbq sauce, just some garnishes and great flavor.  Drink options were plenty and the server was very helpful with selecting a main course and stopped by frequently.

The atmosphere was laid back, upscale casual and a good change of pace from the other E 4th options.Really wanted to like this place and leave them a great review. I am a burger guy and anytime I get a chance to go to a good burger place I take it. 

We got here and sat at the bar. I was impressed with the food options. I picked the Buffalo burger cooked medium. A little pink. With my choice of wheat bun and toppings. Got our order in and waited about 20 minutes for the food to come. No biggie. 

Our food comes and I bite into my burger and the inside is rare. I send it back because the meat is so raw on the inside. They then cut my bite off and browned the area they just cut off. So it appeared cooked. I took another bite and it's still raw inside. At this point I am not sending my food back. I ate the bun and left meat there. $30 burger and I couldn't eat it because it was so raw. Will never eat here again.We stopped in for lunch on 9\/19\/12.  The minute we walked in we noticed a slight smell.  Not sure what it was-I thought sort of fishy.  It was fairly busy with some large groups (mostly Asian families) which seemed to be a good sign.  

We ordered off the lunch menu which was a good deal.  (I believe 6 or 7.95).  I had the Chicken Pad Thai.  It was fine.  It came with some tasty fried rice though.  My one friend ordered Pork Pad Thai -he said it was good.  His wife ordered Pork Pad See Yew.  She said it was "fine".  One thing we all noticed was that it took almost 25 minutes to get our food.  Our food was not THAT good though. 

Polite servers but we had to ask for refills and the bill.  Maybe they are better for dinner and to be fair we ordered off the lunch menu but with all the other options in Vegas I doubt I would return.Great burgers! French fires are great well done. I've heard the hot dogs are real good too, but have never had one.

It would easily get 5 stars from me if they added some creative milkshakes to the menu -- I'll bet that would bring in more kids with their parents too. They'd need to be made with fresh, local real ice cream from, say, Udder Delights or Sweet Republic. Since they'd have the ice cream if they did that, I'll bet they could add more fun and $$$ per customer if they added scoops and sundaes to the dessert menu.

Side note - the decor looks a little confused: too put together and non-eclectic to be a "dive bar" ambiance (like Greasewood Flats), and not finished enough to look like a local burger bar (like Zinburger), or stuck in the middle (like The Grind). But it still gets an A+ for great-tasting, mesquite wood-grilled burgers and really friendly service.Have been looking for a Greek restaurant everywhere and I'm thrilled that i found this place on yelp one day! It's delicious! Try the "BBF's", the homemade baklava, and everything on the menu! They even have a rewards program and outdoor seating.My husband and I went to this subway location at 10:30pm on Friday June 22nd.There were 3 employees at this location at the time.A male employee balancing the register, and two older women.When my husband entered the Subway ,he was not greeted or acknowledged or anything at all.He stood there, waiting and waiting, and still no employees acknowledged him at all.The male worked was working on the cash register, but the two women were not working at all.One was behind the register and the other female worker was leaning on the opposite site.The two older female workers were just talking to each other, gossiping and talking about their day, still not taking my husband's order, not acknowledging him, not saying nothing.He walked out with them not caring at all.This is rude and unprofessional.The service was terrible.There was no customer service whatsoever.We will never go to this location again.The employees should be fired.They obviously do not care for customer service and their jobs at all, and are so ungrateful when other people can't get a job and would never treat an opportunity for income so poorly.Great food and service! Always come here for great selection of food!  High quality meats and still for a great price. Can't go wrong! 

Parking is tight so come earlier in the day and you should be good.Absolutely horrible food.  Ordered the fried rice that tasted like it was 3 days old.. Stale as hell.  The nihari tasted like paya. chilli chicken had no chilli flavour and the corn soup tasted like boiled water with over boiled chicken shreds.  Would not even recommend this place to my enemy.  Spent about $100.00 and got dog food.2 stars for the decor and service. Both were good. Food and coffee..don't waste your money.Cool place. Huge with a couple bars. Nice beer selection. Always busy with a good looking crowd. I've had good service all the times I've been here.Driving thru so i can get away from van burn street asap!Ok...just ok. The first time we went the food was great. This time it was ok. The bread was disappointing. It was less than Olive Garden quality with Ventano prices.The Bilboquet ice cream and hot coffee drinks were excellent and we pretended we were hip by hanging out in the post-industrial space that features bathroom doors you can't figure out how to open and a football-field long (so it seems) laptop bar with only four outlets (two at either end). I wasn't any cooler for having hung out there for a while, but I sure felt like I could pretend to be cooler. OTOH my baby hipster 11 year old hanging out in his fedora sneering at his younger brother while nibbling on mango ice cream fit the place perfectly. Excellent vibe and grub. Also one of the better cafe au laits, in the French style, we've enjoyed in a long time, and very nice staff.I came here years ago and was finally able to come back! It was just as amazing as i remembered!I am from New York so I am use to great Chinese food. Jade place is fantastic just like New York Chinese food. Chicken and cashew nuts is a great dish also egg rolls are amazing. Staff is friendly I highly recommend jade palace.Wait time sucks. They keep dealing with drive thru and not the customers inside. We are all customers and the orders need to be processed in order. 

Do go here if you do t ha e an hour to wait for a cheese burgerWe ordered the skillet breakfast, pancakes, ham breakfast and let's just say there was no talking at the table! Unless our awesome waiter Derek came by to check on us, in which case there was tons of talking. Probably the nicest, friendliest servers I've ever had. He really made our breakfast experience just that much better. But seriously the food was AWESOME! Service was great! Can't go wrong!Over the years, I have visited Anton & James quite a few times. The location is, without any doubt, extremely convenient - It is a great restaurant to visit when you are in a hurry and are looking for a good fast-food restaurant downtown. Their food is, also, quite better than what other fast-food chains offer!

However, every time I visit the banner, I somehow feel a little ripped off. Yes, their food is good, fresh. Yes, the quality of the ingredients is a gazillion times better than what you would find at your local Golden Arches. However, I am one of those who cannot help but frown a little when they have to pay more than 20$ in a fast food restaurant. 

Last time i visited A&J, I opted for the Mediterranean Pizza, which was satisfying and prepared with fresh veggies, feta and basil. The taste was good, but never as impressive as anything I could have tasted in a true Italian restaurant for the same price. 

A friend of mine with which I visited this place told me that it reminded her of an "Airport cafeteria". Somehow, I cannot disagree.Rude people in the front desk, non smoking rooms smell like smoking rooms! Everywhere in the casino is filled with smoke you cannot even breathe comfortably. You go back into your room smelling like cigarettes. We tried canceling our rooms and they told us it wouldn't be a problem however as soon as we found a better place to book they would not authorize our cancelation. Wouldn't recommend the stay here. Oh and there isn't free wifi ! You need to pay $11, a night !!OK, I am not a fan of fast food anyway, but I do remember eating bagels on occasion from Einstein in the past and enjoying them.  This visit however, had me thinking that the product has been cheapened over the years. 
Service was quick and friendly but the first bad sign was that they didn't have real butter for my bagel, only a butter substitute, which is just not my thing.  I ordered a cinnamon apple bagel and the way it was put together made it very difficult to eat, because the apple pieces were rather large chunks that kept dropping onto the ground as I bit into the bagel.  Luckily I was eating it outside :)
The part of the bagel that had been under the apple was very doughy as though it hadn't baked properly.  On top of that it had perhaps been stored to close to the savory bagels because I would occasionally get a bite that tasted strongly of garlic.  Ick!As an out of town Yelper, I turned to my Yelp friends for dining advice while on business in the Cleveland area.  Thanks for your help, it was pretty good food.  The ala carte salad pushed this into the spendy range, and that's what's keeping me from giving the 5-star salute to Players.  Tonight, the mango-lime scampi was tasty - what nailed it for me was the roasted jalapeno whipped potatoes, black bean sauce and lime-cilantro emulsion cast in for texture.  I love hot - the potatoes got better as the meal progressed, like that really good "creeper reefer" everyone always used to talk about.  Ambiance? Yes.  Nice place for a meal - subdued and relatively spacious.  Dig it.I had a specialty tea and it was delicious.  The garlic fries are perfect everytime I come here.Very bad service! 
We ordered 2 pasta which come with unlimited soup or salad, the food was ok but the service was bad. 
The waitress literally just took our order and delivered the food, she did not ask us how's the food or if we want refill of soup and salad. When I asked for more soup she said there's no more soup left! It was only 8PM and they close at 11! She then collected all the plates and gave me the bill. I was extremely disappointed and definitely NO RETURN!Nothing to rave about. Nothing really exciting except maybe one thing, when you check-in you get a good rate and then an extra $20 a night for resort fee is tacked on. Hence the reason for only two stars, if I could give them 1 1\/2 stars that'd be my rating.  Was to be $108 now $158. Room old with old tv & really not the cleanest, 3 tv stations if you're lucky. If I was lucky I'd be gamblingEasy atmosphere, really yummy food!  Try the chips (round sliced french fries)!Not worth it. We asked to be sitting in a booth they put us in a corner where I had a chair. we told them it was our first time they brought us an appetizer so the manager wanted to give this to us for first time. We ordered a taster off the menu that would give us a variety they brought is the exact same appetizer that we just had for free. I asked if I could have sparkling water with lime they brought me sparkling water my wife asked for Diet Coke they didn't bring her Diet Coke. We have to request to have lime brought to the table they brought his lemon. we ordered two rolls off the menu recommended by the waitress. having lived in Japan for three years traveled around the world eating sushi all over I would say the sushi restaurant was average at best. As we were eating sushi one of the selected sushi was not good I had to spit it out into a napkin. I told this to the waiter all he did is apologize and shrug it off. The restaurant was half packed at most. The music was loud constant beat. I think we were sitting under an air conditioning vent it was cold we were sitting close to the exit. for dessert we ordered mochi ice cream. I think the tray that they brought the mochi ice cream was not completely clean. Because when we ate the mochi ice cream it tasted like fish. When we receive the bill it was over $200 for two people. Very disappointed.Pizza the way I love it: thin crust with fresh and creative toppings!

I was one of a party of 3, dining on a rainy evening - I think we were lucky, because the wait was just a bit under 5 minutes.

We started with the calamari, which was lightly battered and fried - and the red pepper almond sauce was a delightful twist!
The three of us each ordered a pizza, and shared: Grilled Eggplant, Ontario Ricotta Di Bufala, and Prosciutto & Arugula.  Let me tell you - the surprise of the bunch - even without cheese, the peppery arugula and the salty meat came together and made that pizza irresistible.  And I love me some cheese.  Speaking of, the Ricotta was the lightest, freshest ricotta ever.  One of my friends mentioned that he thinks they make it fresh themselves - this sort of dedication to fresh ingredients gets a big check mark in my books.

Service was attentive and friendly.  There wasn't an overwhelming wait, but given the rumours I had heard about the line-ups, I was pleasantly surprised to find that they never rushed us, and continued to refill our waters when we just wanted to hang out and chat.  Again, I think we were pretty lucky in that it wasn't too too busy.

Finally, while I'm no wine expert, we had plenty of the Rosso Toscana "Il Bosco", and it was a great accompaniment to our meal.

Great portions - had a great lunch the next day :)Hands down best Indian food in Montreal for vegetarians. No matter how far away I have ended up living from Pushap I keep coming back here. 

There's a menu but most people just stick with the taly of the day with either the chickpea or lentil talys.  Ordering off the menu generally takes a lot longer to get the food.  If you go with the taly of the day, for about $7 you can get a huge meal (two talys, rice, salad, nan, dessert, and a chana samosa).  Best deal in town. 

Located close to the metro so its easy to get to. 

Service is generally very good. If you don't finish your food, you might get scolded and probably won't get your dessert. The owners are very friendly though and loyal to their repeat customers (I usually get a few extra sweets in my bag or extra helpings of chana samosa). 

A true gem in this city!Everyone I have ever taken here, loves it.  They have very tasty food that is always fresh.  I don't know how they do it, but everything has such intense flavors.  Service is always good and prices are fair for the taste, freshness and service.  Small and quaint they do have one table for a larger group.I like this place for take out -- love their salad dressing ! Get the gyro Greek salad . Yum!!Been here a ton in the past, but it had been a while since I'd stopped in. We ordered to go and sat in the bar area waiting. The general manager was making drinks and chatting with us. I was super impressed by his level of service and that of his staff. Would highly recommend this place to anyone who enjoys stir-fry.I have no idea why people like this place. I have been here several times with co-workers and dread it. The first time I went, I asked the waitress to surprise me with a taco trio. The flavors she picked sounded fantastic, but I was woefully disappointed. The flavors were drab and the tacos were greasy. I tried different combos afterwards, but none of them had a distinct flavor that left an impression. It's a cute concept being in an old church, but none of their food stands out.I know this location has a ton of mixed reviews but I honestly have never had a problem here. I work down the street on the AFB and I put in large to go orders.  The staff has always been very friendly to me which I appreciate. I  have been coming here over a year and non of my orders have ever been wrong and the temperature of the food is perfect as well. Bacon cheese burgers with guacamole is my go to lunch item with a side of zucchini. And let me tell you those zucchini sticks are huge. 
The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I feel the prices are just a little steep.I'm a sucker for fresh noodles and I was told that they make their own here. I also LOVE my ramen spicy so I was eager to try this place out once I heard about it. The inside is really small but I love the simplicity of the design. It was pretty busy when I came here but the wait was surprisingly short.

I ordered the medium spicy miso ramen (should have gotten hot\/fire). I didn't add any other toppings because I thought they were on the pricey side. Most of them are $1+. I thought the broth and the stuff it came with is comparable to the spicy ramen from Ramen Sora (ground meat, bamboo, etc). The broth is super thick and heavy, but delicious.

The staff was really friendly but once they brought out our check, I felt really rushed. The lady was about to take my bowl away before I even answered her question as to whether I was finished or not. I get that it's a small place and people are waiting but I'm a slow eater and don't like to be rushed.Went to try happy hour a few times, always end up leaving because we never get recognized, but then again it's also been pretty busy. Went back on a week day around 3 so that there wouldn't be a big crowd. Server got there right away, although we were the only table. We ordered food immediately with our drinks.. But then we literally never saw him again. He forgot my salad. My veggie roll had no asparagus in it. We had a buy one get one entree that we never got to use because we never got a chance to see him to even ask about it. Had to ask the servers standing around for pretty much anything we needed, including refills. My veggie roll was on the bill twice. The food was good... I wish I got the salad I ordered though... the Moscow mules were disgusting. And the service was horrible. Thought third time would be the charm.The salmon burger was very flavorful and was cooked perfectly but the sweet potato fries were a little overcooked. Our dinner group of seven were there tonight during the busy dinner time but we were taken aback on our fast our food came out! We all thought it was nice that our waitress came to tell us happy hour was almost over if we wanted to order more drinks. Definitely will return.Went here for a "shafts Bleu" burger as I also do and a vanilla milk shake. Everything is fast and yummy. I like Dr. Pepper and they serve coke and no they don't have Mr. Pibb  oh well. The food makes up for the lack of Dr. pepper.This place deserves 5 stars. Great value for your money. Top notch ingredients and their cheesesteak tastes just like the ones on the east coast!Been to this bar about 10 times and every time I have had a great time. Just make sure there is a band playing and you are garaunteed to have a rip-roaring great time. Drinks are flowing and the Irish music is blaring. They even have an Irish dancer. The band even had a groupie, the last time we went. This is a real Irish Pub. I never ate here but I am sure the food is good. But if you are in the mood to have a great time and drink, this is definitely the place to be. Visit on a Friday or Saturday night and go early as the place is a wee bit small and it gets crowded. Park yourself next to the bar and start pounding the drinks. AWESOME!!!This review is for Pam Prasifka! She has been doing my hair for awhile now and she is always consistent!  Once I step into the salon she makes me feel pampered and leaves me looking amazing! She's a joy to talk to as well! Will never trust anyone else with my hair! She is the BEST!I've eaten here a few times in the past. Finally brought my wife because she has been wanting some Vietnamese food. She absolutely loved it and I wasn't disappointed. Tried a few items that I haven't tried before. Their avocado shake was really good and it was my first time trying it. Will definitely be coming back.I was craving for a good sandwich for lunch one day and found La Cay.

Their salad roll combo with any sub you want is a good deal for $11.50. It comes with 3 salad rolls and they don't water down the hoisin sauce until its it's bland. The sub was fresh and tasty.

I saw them making homemade wontons so I might try that next time. I like that local restaurants like this that make things from scratch.

I'll definitely try La Cay again when I'm in the area.Delicious food and great atmosphere. They have unique desserts and the server was wonderful! The mac and cheese my friend had was delicious and I had the delicious risotto. Another friend a delicious flatbread. We will be back!This was our first visit in our new hometown.  Appeared to be clean and we could see the burgers being prepared right in front of us.  It took the staff more than five minutes to even acknowledge us.  As I contemplated leaving, we were met with: "What can I do for you?" Hmmmm... I thought, I'm sorry that we're hungry.  Despite the less than stellar first impression, hungry won out and we ordered.  I prayed that we wouldn't be disappointed.  Dad & I got the Jalapeno Char-burger Special ($4.99).  It was pretty darn good!  I recommend either the onion rings or the sweet potato fries- YUM!  Kids meals looked to be good because my son ate all the chicken nuggets, applesauce, and gummy burger for dessert.  My daughter had a regular charburger and liked it.  VERY relieved that the food rocked!  Hopefully the service will be better next time because I rate this place higher than Sm*$£But&÷R!!!The white pizza and Sicilian are consistently great.   Yelp said this isn't long enough so I will say it again.  I love their white pizza and Sicilian.  YumThank you, iPhone!  You took us to Rosati's, and we were delighted with everything:  the waitress, the coziness, the friendly customers there with us; and, of, course, the deep dish Chicago pan pizza. The slightly sweet, crisp crust; the savory sausage; the nutty warm cheese; that wonderful sauce!  We will be back!Decided to come here after seeing it on instagram and yelp. I had the chicken and waffles and it was so good! Nice big portions, chicken seasoned nicely and waffles had jalapeño in it. Service was great. They also gave us a taste of their house made tiramisu cake which was amazing. Definitely coming back here to try their other dishes.Found this place while walking in Yorkville on a drizzly, mild Monday around noon.  Skimmed the menu outside and the $18.95 lunch specials looked good, so my partner and I decided to check it out.  Nice romantic, cozy atmosphere, with a few separate rooms, traditional Italian decor, many tables, a wine cellar, and private bathrooms decorated the same as the dining areas.  Photos of the chef with many celebrities who have dined here is a fun touch.  (although somewhat common in the neighborhood).  The restaurant itself is on the lower level of the street, down a few steps, and I am not sure if there is a ramp for accessibility.  We were greeted right away by a friendly male server who was prompt throughout the meal, friendly without being too chatty.  The Caesar salads were good (without bacon) and the pesto fusilli was delicious.  We both had the same dishes as the lunch special, but I'd love to go back and try a few of their other choices.  Their regular menu looks great too, with tons of italian choices, and a huge wine selection.  I'd love to come back here.I love this place! The first time I went, my parents were in town visiting and they wanted brunch. I had read good reviews about this restaurant on yelp, so we decided to try it. Unfortunately, there was about a 30 minute wait with a line out the door. We decided to stay and try it out since we were already there, even though my dad hates waiting more than 10 minutes at restaurants. The wait staff was very apologetic about the wait (unnecessarily...their food is just too good!) and polite. My dad ordered the chicken and waffles, which turned out to be incredibly delicious, but so much food that we couldn't even help him finish it! My mom and I ordered ham and cheese crepes, which were very good. My husband ordered the special that day, which was a mac n cheese benny. This is where they really hit the nail on the head. They form mac n cheese into cubes, fry them up, and cover them in an egg and hollandaise sauce. I have been back to this restaurant five times since and have tried omelettes, regular bacon and eggs, chicken and waffles, the massive, and huevos locos and I've never been disappointed by anything I've ordered. However, my favorite thing on the menu has definitely been mac n cheese benny. Everything on the menu is reasonably priced, too. My advice--if there's a line, Faberge is absolutely worth the wait!Food's great don't get me wrong. 

Customer service is a bit awful. 

Ordered an orange chicken lunch special and tasted different, worse. I went to the restaurant and asked why it tasted bad, they said they had a new cook the day i ordered. Now their chef is back. I asked for a replacement lunch special. Declined my request. 

Eat at your own risk.My colleagues have raved about this place for months. Today, on my lunch break, I decided to give it a try. I placed an order to go for a grilled chicken banh mi, shrimp spring rolls and a Vietnamese iced coffee. After picking it up and bringing it back to work to eat... To my dismay, I discovered mid-bite in a spring roll that there was actual dirt in the lettuce that was in the spring roll. I was mortified. Might I add that it was also missing vermicelli noodles and cucumber. The grilled chicken banh-mi was not grilled, but sautéed.. however it did have good flavors to it, but since I am traumatized by the spring rolls, I will not be coming back for a second visit or ever.Two-and-a-half stars get bumped to three because, come on, we all have to have our go-to, barely-above-average neighborhood Chinese food joint. This one is ours. Comments about greasiness are, unfortunately, accurate. We decided to stop ordering the scallion pancake because it would show up soaked through with grease. More flimsy thank flakey. And Sichuan green beans come rather more sauced than is necessary. But I'm a fan of the ginger chicken, and chow mein and fried rice plates hit the sweet spot of what you know and love about American Chinese food. Chicken wings are pleasantly crispy with a bit of pepper infused heat. And so on. In all, very few surprises here, either positive or negative. Take comfort in the averageness.Our relatives brought us to Allo Mon Coco for breakfast.  There are quite a few locations in Montreal.  I think this is the branch we visited.  

The breakfast did not disappoint.  Each of us was happy and stuffed!  Our crepes were extremely delicious!!  Sorry, but I do not remember the names of our crepes.  Have a feeling that they are all good.

Highly recommend visiting one of their locations when in Montreal!!Wow here's a little hidden gem off the Strip. If you have haven't experienced Twin Creeks, you should! It's a perfect place to take a date with it's relaxing, modern atmosphere. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because our server was horrible but the rest of the experience was memorable.

We arrived for dinner during their happy hour so we were able to order from the tapas menu, which we used as appetizers. Unfortunately they were out of their roasted artichoke so we settled for the cheese stuffed mushrooms. These baby portabellas were quite enjoyable. I would describe in depth but all it took me was one bite! 

We then proceeded to order from the dinner menu and hey a nice steak dinner for 2 people under $70 is good in my book. 

First up, the bread. Wow, it probably was the best bread basket I've had in a while or maybe I was just really hungry! The pretzel rolls had a nice fluff to them and were warm. Now the best deal are the classic dinners. My partner ordered the chicken Milanese and it was actually really good. The chicken was moist and the breading was fried perfectly that it provided a nice crispy crust. The meal also came with 2 sides and a salad for around . The salad was a spring mix with homemade balsamic vinaigrette. The dressing was actually really enjoyable. The consistency was perfect, not too thick and not too thin. The two sides were mash potatoes and broccolini. Luckily the taters didn't taste as processed as some of the other joints but you can tell it was fresh homemade mash taters. Overall this meal was enjoyed.

So it's really hard to go to a steakhouse and not order a steak, of course I had to try their steak. I ordered the 8 oz filet Mignon with mac & cheese and asparagus. The filet Mignon was so tender, it just melted in your mouth. The only downside to my steak was that it was a bit dry. However, it didn't stop me from devouring that luscious piece of meat!. My only suggestion to the staff would be to possibly add a beef broth\/gravy ramekin on the side in case the steak is dry. But I am a true believer that the best steak is one with no sauces\/gravys or over seasoned, just salt & pepper. Now again it's hard to screw up asparagus but all you have to do is steam them and add salt. The mac & cheese, eh I've had better.

Again, it's a great place for a romantic dinner where you don't have to spend a lot of money for a steak. Afterwards, enjoy a cocktail at the Mermaid bar by the tank or the flare bar. The employees are great and actually run the food out quickly (trust me, they sprint that food out to you). Yes our server Rob (oops did I just say that out loud?) was not the best and took him forever to come to our table and would forget to bring stuff. C'mon dude get it together, it wasn't that busy.

I would definitely go back for dinner, hopefully we get someone different next time!I was right, coming back more has made this place grow on me. The hurricanes are so much better than they were before and the food is amazing. The staff is all great and I've become friends with several of them. 

Try the jackfruit fries, O.M.G.I can't help it.  I'm going to have to disagree with the other people who reviewed Whole Foods, even the one I happen to share a house with.  I love everything in this place starting and ending with the samples.  Did you know that if you ask an employee about a particular food they are allowed to open it for you to try?  Best tip ever.We just found D's though it is only 10 minutes from our house.  Their steak & cheese is great.  I loved their pizza - thinner crust - if you are a fan of the big puffy bubbly crust, this doesn't have it - but it does have delicious flavor!  Service has been quick & friendly.  I love the old tables from Wendy's!Smash burger always has great options, but what I like the most are there portions. You can eat a nice burger and not feel like you've eaten too much. Smash tots are always my favorite. Very close to Salt river tubbing so this is a good place to stop after.Utterly disappointing..it's not the same Dimas that used to be better than roberto's tacos..the new owners haven't figured it out..the food is tasteless and not fresh like it used to be..the quality was terrible..the cleanliness of the restaurant and staff were horribly Gross..I'm sorry to say that Dimas has got us for the last time.I wish I had checked the reviews before eating here. Even eat is all dry and chewy. The service is slow. The hot sauce is not hot it taste like sweet sauce.  The beans are crunchy\/undercookedMy significant other and I chose Georges as the place to celebrate our first anniversary. It was a lovely experience.

The service was attentive and friendly, as is only appropriate for an upscale establishment.  We began with crusty French bread and champagne while we waited on our entrees, which arrived with amazing swiftness.  I ordered the sea bass on top of a seared polenta cake, and it was delicious.  The fish was perfectly cooked, with the skin crispy and wonderfully salty.  The polenta cake was browned to perfection, and the accompanying haricots verts were crisp and satisfying.  

For dessert, we shared a cheese platter.  We picked the chèvre and brie and told the waitress to pick her favorites for the other three selections.  The cheeses were served with tasty fruit compote and candied walnuts.  It made for a classy end to the evening.

We had a wonderful time at Georges.  It's too pricey to be an everyday excursion, but I highly recommend it for special occasions.  We will return as soon as we get an excuse to splurge.Visiting Cleveland from California decided to stop by Mabel's BBQ. It did not disappoint. The food was excellent and the service was great. Our server was Samantha she definitely knew her menu and gave great recommendations. We had the polish girl sandwich amazing, lamb ribs and brisket so tender, and their new side zucchini and squash.I've been to a few Filipino restaurants (in a variety of cities) and this by far is one of the best.  The establishment is very clean and the entire set-up (tables, chairs, etc.) allows for a comfortable eating experience. The food is served in reasonable proportions. I ate one of my favorite filipino dishes, Kare Kare, which was cooked to near perfection. I recommend this dish to anyone that eats over here. Our group also ordered Crispy pata, which offered the right texture and crunchiness that one expects from a dish. The service was also fantastic. I highly recommend this place!We came in today at 8. They don't close till 9. When we tried to order a milk shake the guy at counter just flat out said no. Cause he did t wanna clean the machine again. Why would you stop serving an hour before you close? When people know you for burgers and shakes.The food at Crop is great but the service completely ruined the night. Awful! We were at the restaurant for over 4 hours. Service was slow and poor. We will not go back due to the poor service.The ribs are A-mazing, and the sauce is very good.  Skip the chicken - it's always dried out.  The fries are hand cut and delicious too though, and everyone there is very friendly.Would Defined suggest going for lunch as the specials are on fleek! Definitely get the shrimp tempura--while fried carrots may sounds like walking cholesterol it taste like heaven. Didn't give this five stars because when I went the lunch wait was extremely long but I think that's because our server forgot about us.Great food, fun atmosphere and the best mojitos you'll find in Las Vegas. We had the Cuban sandwiches, along with the appetizer combo and carmelized plantains.  If you haven't tried their Cuban food, you're missing out. I am hoping this stays a Cuban restaurant and doesn't turn into another Mexican restaurant. We have enough of those in town. Cuban food is unique and delicious!A great place for a salad, an ice tea, and a 7 layer bar. Another AZ favorite for many years. Aside from the delightful food, the selection of pastries is great. I love sitting outside and enjoying the sun at one of the tables scattered throughout El Pedregal. It's so peaceful, you really can't beat it.

A definite lunch time stop of you are in the area.I love the food at viva chicken. I always get the viva salad or 1\/4 chicken with sides. The stuffed avocado is delicious too. I am giving 3 stars because it is impossible to get nutritional information. I think this is unacceptable. I hope they figure that out soon.We have been here twice now and I wish we had more money so we could visit more often, lol. The steak was perfectly cooked to order (medium rare). It had so much flavor and was super tender; cutting it feels like a knife through butter. I found it better than Fleming's and Morton's steaks. For sides, the Sautéed Mushrooms were tasty and not too salty. The Gorgonzola Mac & Cheese is delicious, tops among the steakhouses we have been to. The Lobster Mashed Potatoes are amazing and flavorful, though quite expensive ($35). The mash is made separately, then large pieces of fresh lobster are stirred in tableside by the waiter, ensuring the mash isn't too lobstery and that it retains the two distinct flavors.

The first time we came, it was our anniversary so we were gifted a complimentary Chocolate Sin Cake. It was fluffy and not too overpoweringly chocolatey. The second visit, we had to make sure we tried the Warm Butter Cake, since it has its own Twitter handle and all. It was served warm with ice cream and was topped with freshly whipped cream and assorted fruits. It was delicious. We only finished half, so we took the rest home (including the extra whipped cream), and it still tasted great the next day.

Service was great both times; the wait staff was friendly, helpful, and professional. Overall, they provide a great experience that leaves us wanting to return as soon as we leave.Their fish and chips are delicious and I love the feel of the restaurant inside. It feels small town and friendly. I want to try other dishes but always end up with the fish and chips! Their fried cheese is unique and delicious too.I've been wanting to try this place after reading such great reviews from my friends. They did not disappoint me. I came here with my bf and friend and we ordered the Ronin burger and Kiki burger. I loved the Kiki burger. The meat was of excellent quality and I loved the sauteed variety of mushrooms and onions. The Truffle Parmesan fries are fabulous! I love the truffle sauce drizzled on top. It came with a unique sauce, a great variation from your typical ketchup. The Sweet Potato fries were good too. Don't forget to order the Strawberry Lemonade, which is the best I've ever had. They puree strawberries and mix it in the lemonade. Delish!We have ordered from this place at least 30 times.  The delivery time has always been earlier than quoted and the food is always as ordered.  It's fresh food!  We love it!  Staff is 100% polite and take great care of us.  I'm a critic too.  I can't stand poor service.  I'm the type that will always tip 20% but won't call for delivery or go back if it's bad.Not only do you feel like you have gone back in time when you shop here, (decor, lady screaming on the PA system, 80's music piped in the background) the food appears to be from the past as well.  Check the date on everything you buy from this store because I cannot tell you how many times I have had to put something back because it is expired.Went once when it was fairly recently opened. The tacos and drinks were good. I was not blown away but not disappointed either. Would go back again to try though. 

Service was pretty quick and located conveniently on king west. Suggest trying it once for sure.This Demetres that opened up in the heart of Downtown Markham is SO CUTE and packed af. I was here Friday night around 9 and waited nearly 50 minutes to be seated and then another 30 mins for our food.

Like other reviewers have mentioned, I saw many tables that either needed to be cleaned or empty...I guess they need to hire more people especially when their lineup is out the door. 

I opted to create my own crepe which included a choice of ice cream and 3 toppings and my cousin got one of the pre-made ones. I chose the ultra ripe mango sorbet (it tasted ultra ripe indeed ) with fresh strawberries, brownies, and strawberry coulis (taste like jam). 

The strawberry coulis actually didn't go well with the mango sorbet...it was quite bitter. So don't get the two together if you're planning to creat your own! The scoop of ice cream was MASSIVE. When you look at it carefully it looked like 3 scoops instead of 1, and when you look at the full crepe as a whole, it just looked very u proportional hahah but that's not something to complain\/worry about.We came here awhile back for lunch. We came here b\/c at the time It said that we would get a % off If we mentioned we saw this on Yelp. This is the specific reason we went there and had even heard of it. 

I ordered the Puttanesca and my bf ordered a baked cheese something or another. His tasted great, mine was very bland. I wouldnt reorder this again. The breadsticks in the bag were good and garlicky but I cant eat them so it was more torture to just get a small nibble . . to know its good and not be able to eat it.. :(

Well here's where the deduction for the add'l 2 starts comes from:
We asked for the check and mentioned we saw this on Yelp. He said he didnt know anything about it. Normally I'd just let this go but it was the way he spoke to us very condescending and I felt a little disrespected. I asked him if he had a manager (which I NEVER EVER do) he left and came back and said oh he's out for a little bit, I said ok, well can you call him? 
yes... that was little ole me asking for the manager to be phoned. I said I didnt think it was right to advertise buy one get one 1\/2 off  if you mention you saw it on Yelp and then take it back once you get people in. that's false advertising... 

He came back and said he called the manager, and that he agreed to take off the discount which was probably no more than $6 or $7 at most. All that for $6.00, really? you're willing to risk losing a customers over that? well they must not be hurting if they can risk being rude. . 

Would I come back? maybe, ok, let's be honest probably not likely considering there are sooo many places in LV and Henderson where I can spend my $. 

They do have a nice view in the afternoon\/night if you sit by the window. HOwever, I've also heard you get that same great view if you goto Lindo Michoacan. . .This restaurant deserves 5-stars for its great food, great price (less than $6 for almost all main dishes), and great authentic selections. It's one of the best Vietnamese Restaurants in the Phoenix area.  Broth has so much flavor, good portions for all noddle soup and rice plates, and also have good variety of desserts to choose from.  To me, their service is typical for an Asian restaurant that doesn't overcharge you for good food.  By Western standards, their service is lacking (better if you speak the language).  They do seat you right away even when they are busy, and food comes out fast, but don't expect much more than that.  They do accept all major credit cards.  You can eat a lot for 2 people at this place under $20!If you're hungry for brunch COME HERE!!! The food is excellent and totally worth the wait that can sometimes get a little long on the weekends. 

They can make anything gluten free and they are very accommodating. They have 20 million different types of pancakes (maybe exaggerating a little) and they have an eggs Benedict flight so you can try different kinds!! I'm fairly certain they have the best bacon I've ever tasted. The food quality is insane. And it's not super expensive. The pancake flight is a super good idea if you can't decide and the breakfast tacos are soooooo tasty!!!! My husband is obsessed with the BEAT sandwich with over easy eggs. Coffee here is excellent! They have tons of different cocktails too for those looking for a lil buzz. 

The service is world class here too! It's like the cheers of brunch. Joshua makes the best coffee drinks and mans the bar. He's so cool and sweet and always says hi to us. Cray is also so super cool and we love getting her table because she's so much fun. 

Fun fact: makes a great first date spot - SNOOZE IS MAGIC!!! 

This has become our regular Sunday destination. I will recommend this place all day err day. Aaaaaand all the locations we've been to have been consistently awesome. This one is just our fave.Went up to Toronto for the Memorial Day weekend and too catch a Blue Jays game. Stopped in on the Loose Moose for an late lunch\/early dinner. Place had a good crowd for a Thursday, but still plenty of tables to sit. Food and service were good; prices too. Wound up coming back for a quick lunch before our flight back to NYC. oh...and the Jays won!I came hunting for a cup of espresso because sometimes you just need that late morning, caffeine pick-me-up, particularly in Vegas.

Kept it simple, ordered an Americano (espresso + water).  It was HOT HOT HOT.  Yeah, yeah, of course it's hot but no it was so hot I had to wait awhile before I could even get a sip of my precious life water.

When I finally got around to it, it was SMOOOOOTH!!  Love a smooth Americano.  Sometimes, you just never know and it's so acidic but this hit the spot.

Why not 5 stars? Because the picking up of the drinks was confusing as they just called out drinks and people were confused as to whose was whose.Great service order the chicken fajitas unreal can't talk enough about how good it was.   If you are looking for great atmosphere great food great service you have to try this place. Great job folks enjoyed it immenselyWe arrived to mgm grand on November 24 2016 my wife and I, first thing we notice is that they start charging money for parking even the hotel guests, if you chose to use the valet service the hotel will charge you $18 per day if you use the self parking the hotel will charge you $10 a day, I personally think it is very very not good for hotel to charge his guests money for parking.
We step in to get our key to the room, Ryan was a very nice guy behind the counter check everything and told us that the room we order on line is not available so he will upgrade us to a bigger room the only difference is that we will have a queen bed instead of king , we sad OK took the keys and went up to the room, once we stem in we notice that the room was not clean at all and the bad Cover was on the bad, half on the bad and half on the floor. Besides that we didn't like the very SMALL queen bad. we go down to the desk to Ryan again and told him about the room wasn't ready for new guests and that we like to get a king bed just like we order at the beginning, Ryan went to his manager and come back to us says that the manager didn't confirm him to give us a king bed unless we pay additional price of $20 a night!!!!!!!! We order from the beginning a king bed and they can't supply it so we need to pay additional  $20..
We ask to speak with the manager his name is Dominique, SUPER RUDE AND VERY NOT PROFESSIONAL FOR A MANAGER!!
after going back and forth with him about us getting the room we order with no additional price he finally agree to give us a king size room BUT, WE WENT IN TO THE ROOM STEPPING IN TO THE ROOM AND GUESS WHAT!?!?!?! THERE IS A COUPLE HAVING SEX ON THE BAD ASKING US "WHAT'S GOING ON"
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THING ANY WHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD???
we went down to Dominique asking him to cancel our deal with Them and give us our money back, he said he can't do it since we don't give him a chance to fix the issue, DOMINIQUE YOU ARE VERY NOT PROFESSIONAL MANAGER AND ALL THIS WASN'T SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN FROM FIRST PLACE IF YOU WERE JUST GIVING US THE ROOM ORDER!!
YOU GAVE ME A KEY TO A ROOM WHERE 2 PPL HAVING SEX ON THE BAD AT 1AM!!!
GUYS DON'T GET ANY CLOSE TO THIS HOTEL EVEN IF IT'S FOR FREE!The grand opening week was the first time we visited - tacos with a minuscule amount of meat - but things have much improved.  I'll chalk it up to the loads of trendy skinny -jean wearers trying to be as cool as we are. Now that it's filled with normal citizens, the food is much improved and they do have a nice draft beer assortment along with some wine for my wife.  It's nice to dance between postino next door and here so you can mix it up depending on what you are craving.  Very cool decor inside and a nice big bar.I used to Love this place been going there for over 20 years. The customer service has gone down as well as the food quality. I would go twice a week for the chips and hot sauce and mild salsa. Sadly they seem to have changed the Hot Sauce recipe and it is not tasty at all. I'm not sure if they changed cooks or what but the food just doesn't taste the same. Please Pedro's get it together you were my all time favorite place.Oh man, this was hands down the best steak I've had in my life. I ordered the $89 rib cap prepared medium rare and it literally melted in my mouth. It was so tender and flavorful and amazing and delicious and I pretty much dream about this steak now. We also ordered the spicy rice and the truffle Mac and cheese. There wasn't a single piece of this meal that was disappointing. I absolutely recommend giving this place a try. 

An added bonus is that they have TV's around the bar so we were able to watch the college football games while enjoying our delicious meal.Service was average. Food was adequate - not bad but nothing extra special to rush back for. The best part was the chicken wings which were meaty and breaded and larger than we expected. Drinks were mixed well and beer cold. Lots of TV's in lounge so if eating wings, drinks and a game are the plan then try this place out. For the prices there are many similar choices that have flavors that are not so bland. We ate at this chain in States a couple of years ago and remember a better meal so a bit disappointed. It was OK.Beer 5 star
Food 3 star
Service 1 star
Atmosphere 1 star

Not as awestruck as I had thought I would be. Food was very hit or miss. Recommend reading the menu very well or you could get someone's attempt at a sweet savory burger that is too far in either direction to blend well. 

Do try the wings and the hot pretzel. The Matador was pretty good too, reminded me of a Philly steak sandwich but on a pretzel bun. 

My husband had the "Meat Treat" flat bread pizza. It was good but we had to ask the waitress where it was, she returned to tell us "they are remaking your order, it will be up in a few (was not a few) minutes." 

I realize it's Friday night, and they were busy, but after our initial seating we had to flag the waitress down for everything and then she would disappear again. Once I flagged her down, she would immediately dart off, and I'd have to say "WAIT.." or she'd take one person's order and leave without asking if anyone else needed anything.

The ketchup that was served with the fries, was pretty awful. That needs to go. 

The house pop tart, tastes very much like the Pillsbury dough boy made it. I'd recognize that overly sweet vanilla icing anywhere.Industry is a bit pretentious without the quality to back it up.  The drink selection and drinks are decent and reasonably-priced (minus the gin cocktail with rosemary, which is the most disgusting thing I've ever drank), but the service and food are generally lacking.  Stick with happy hour, otherwise you'll be sure to be disappointed with what you get for the price.  This place gets busy on the weekends too, so get a seat at the bar early if you can.  Steer clear if you have asthma or allergies--it gets extremely smoky at times and the ventilation is lousy unless the door is open in the summer.My son brought me here yesterday.  I ordered the Machai Acai bowl. Today ...I had to go get another one. So gosh darn good!It has great service and a very nice atmosphere and they waited on us very quickly and came by often to meet our needs! The chef came by to make us our food, everything was great ! I ordered the salmon with the salad, soup noddles, & veggies on the side.. But the salmon was  not quite pleasant!!!  It had a very fishy taste!! It was not what I expected from a But overall The Teppanyaki grill looked fun, with the onion volcano's and the veggie chopping!! I would go again next time I'm in town to try something else on their menu.. Anyhow I had a good time, I would recommend it to anyone!!Outstanding food!  Portions are huge, luckily you can order half orders.  Bread pudding is the best I've ever had.Virtual applause to you Portillo's for handling the masses so efficiently and smoothly! Word spread like wildfire when Portillo's announced that they were coming to Scottsdale. For months, Valley residents from all around waited anxiously for the doors to open. Just recently, Portillo's doors finally opened. Were they ready for the crowds? Yes they most definitely were! 

I've been to Portillo's in Illinois so I knew what I was in for. This Portillo's lives up to its roots. The exterior is bright and welcoming with tables all around. The drive-thru resembles that of an In & Out (in the ordering sense) and the interior reminds me of a 1950's booming diner. Everything is friendly and welcoming about Portillo's, including the staff. I heard that they brought in around 80 Chicago staffers to manage the launch of the Scottsdale opening which was very smart on their part. We visited tonight and although the line was wrapped around the restaurant, we ordered our food and got it within 15 minutes. What's their secret? Complete organization. While we were waiting in line, someone came up and took our order so that by the time we got to the register, all we had to do was hand them our ticket and pay. After that, we got a number and waited for them to call it. Within 5-7 minutes, they called our number and we were ready to feast! 

The food here is really as tasty as people say it is. It's all about the beef, the Italian beef that is. The beef is juicy, tender and flavorful and sits within a soft roll. The fries are delicious and the Chicago dogs are as good as any. I have yet to try the Chopped Salad or the milkshakes but I hear both are extraordinary so I will be ordering them next time. 

All I can say is, believe the hype and pay a visit to Portillo's. It doesn't matter if you've been to one in Illinois or not. Now we have one in Scottsdale and Shea an the 101 is a better place because of it! Welcome to the Valley, Portillo's.I saw this place on yelp and read the great reviews. My family and I decided to try it and we were not disappointed. My husband loved his chicken fried steak. The rest of us got pancakes and they were delish! The staff was great and the owner came by and checked on us several times. So far the best meal we've had on this trip!!I will never go back after the way the manager treated me. She made my green salsa burrito with no green salsa ,really? After i asked the cashier if there was a reason why she didn't put the salsa on. The cashier asked her and she rolled her eyes and made a horrible face until she saw I was looking at her. Then she got defensive came up to me yelling saying she is the manager what my problem was?! Omg like I was throwing a fight? I was just wondering. Never Mind. And if she is the manager yeah well never will be back and tell my friends and family to never visit that place where they treat customers like that.Love this downtown lunch spot! The service was amazing and the young gentleman helped me so much and was very happy to be at work. He even remembered some regulars first name. Great customer service! The food was also delicious with great salads and burritos. There is also a really neat coffee shop inside too!Top notch 'za, good service, excellent price. Highly recommend to anyone in the midtown Toronto area!One word:  Forgettable.

It's only been a couple months since I was in here, and already I've forgotten what we ate... I remember the group we were with... I remember the service was attentive to our large party... And I vaguely remember the interior. But the whole experience was just, very, forgettable.  I even had to double check to see if I've written a review of thyet, is place or not.This place has a pretty cool ambiance. I'll round my 3.5 to a 4. Started with the hush puppies. Now these puppies are pretty big and they come seafood stuffed. Would definitely recommend. I did the Tennessee spiced fried chicken. It was pretty delicious. Has a brown sugar glaze under the toast that pairs well with it. The mac and cheese came as a side. It was just ok. Fairly bland, not much more than that. As for price? Maybe a bit overkill. Got nothing fancy and left at probably $120. This place seems pretty well known for brunch so if I came back it'd probably be to try that. We came on a Friday night and had no wait.They have the worst calamari ever. Really thick, over-cooked, and chewy. The sauce was a mix of cocktail sauce and ketchup. Nice to sit on patio in kensington market, but the food I tried was awful.Small diner like place. Awesome Panang Curry!! They can bring the heat baby!!! Love love!! Kicking this cold right out of my head!!! Just as an (FYI) I love Nicky's Thai. I will however come here more often for the Panang Curry!! Moving forward for them glass plates and lower lighting would be a plus!!My wife and I went for lunch.  The place was NOT busy.  We waited nearly 20 minutes while people who came in after us were seated immediately.  I've heard the food is good but I can't give an actual review because after 20 minutes of being ignored, we left.If you like poor customer service with cheesy gimmicks (buffet coupons that don't work the nights you are staying, resort fees, and customer service that is too overworked to care, then this is the hotel for you!  From check-in through check-out, you will find long lines for registration a pool that is crowded and closes way too early, 7pm when it is 90 degrees outside! 

The only saving grace of this hotel is the poker room and the location, but far better hotels can be found for similar prices.Had a great meal here. The chicken pot pie was amazing and the pot roast delicious. Shared them with a friend. The service was top notch. Highly recommend is you are in Vegas. The ambiance is wonderful as well.I would rate this place as 4 stars, though my wife disagreed and gave it 3.
I loved this way of making the pizza, you can choose your toppings, and it is almost perfect.
The staff are nice, helpful and they can recommend options and communicate well with customers
The crust is lovely, and the taste of the char on the sides is delicious.
The size is small, i thought you can get medium pizza at least for 15 cad.
The toppings are fresh and tasty, but i have couple of comments: roasted garlic needs more roasting and must be cut into smaller pieces, there is no caramelized onions or white sauce.
I recommend people to come and try this thin crust pizza place, you might like the concept, definitely better than other pizza places in the neighborhood.Pizza and sandwiches never disappoint. Occasionally the pickup time estimates they give are off by 20 minutes, but the food is excellent. The bread bites are also to die for and so is the home made ranch dressing.I live in the neighborhood stop by a few times the food is always pretty good, the service is always pretty bad, it's a great place to go up you want to stop drinking because you will be waiting a while for that refillMy boss chose this spot to have our manager's holiday dinner. I don't know why she picked this spot since none of us live by Red Rock Casino, but whatever. I looked at pictures and read reviews before we arrived so I had my heart set on the guacamole and carne tacos. I'll get to the food in a bit. 

I'm glad the restaurant was right in front of the casino. You park in front and its right there as you enter. We had made reservations prior so it was easy to sit our party of 12. Not like we needed reservations anyway because the restaurant wasn't even busy. Our server was quick to offer us drinks and appetizers while we all chatted and decided what to eat. Here comes the food...

Salsa trio-3 salsas perfect for sharing with the table. Our server was nice enough to bring out all 5 of their salsas (which had unlimited refills). All were decent except for the chipotle salsa. It tasted like plastic to me for some reason. And the other salsas were decent. Nothing really stood out as wow. 
 
Guacamole-pretty average guacamole. I could have made better at home. And $10 for a small serving? Yeah no.

Carne tacos- carne asada tacos topped with a watercress-jicama slaw. The meat was really tough and chewy. Another person at my table also said his carne tacos were tough. The watercress-jicama slaw had no jicama and was very bland. I had to put salsa and guacamole in the taco to make it have some sort of flavor. 

So, for my small plate of guacamole and my 4 tough and flavorless tacos, I ended up paying $28. The price would have been fine had I enjoyed my food. So many other taco spots in town that I'd rather go to and spend way less and be satisfied. Definitely do not recommend this place. Our server was nice and made sure our glasses were never empty, which is why it's a 2 star review instead of 1.I LOVE the salads here! My favs are the cob and the quinoa and arugula! I get them with either chicken or shrimp! I love the variety of salad dressings as well! Besides the pizza which to me is also bomb, especially being that it's a chain! Everything I order here is always good, and if ever any issues they handle it in a proper manner! I do wish they had curb side though, I've ordered take out a few times and I do love how the food always comes neatly packed and organized!All the sandwiches are so good! My favorite is the caprese, but I also tried the caribbean jerk one, the roast beef one, the hawaiian one, the club one, the american one, some chicken caesar wrap one and others I can't remember! But seriously, for $6... so worth it!I've been here a couple times and it's still consistently good! I brought some first timers here and they really enjoyed the food. 

Ordered the Pad Thai, Masaman braised beef curry, and Khao Pla Tawt. Of course we also had to order the Thai iced tea! Everything is fairly priced, maybe with the exception of the Thai iced tea (only because I think $5 is more than I expected for it) 

Would recommend everything that we ordered! It's usually really hard to find a Thai place that uses braised beef for their Masaman curry, which I find makes a difference, which is why I always order it when I come here. The beef is so soft and good. The same goes for the Pad Thai, taste is on point! This is the first time trying the Khao Pla Tawt but honestly we loved it too. The fish was fried but it was still moist AND the sauces that it comes with are so good (one sweet and one spicy). 

Will continue to come here and eat the delicious food!Very, very good. The hockey puck was a great warm-up to my Li'l Charli 8" pizza. The sauce and crust were perfect!I have been meaning to right this review for a long time. I've been coming here for years and I've never had a bad experience. Golden Palace always serves top notch sushi and Chinese cuisine. The restaurant is always clean, service and take out is always quick and the staff and family are so wonderful. Don't spend your money anywhere else. If you're in the mood for Chinese, don't spend your money anywhere else!I am actually not even sure why Yelp asked me to review Pizzeria Bianco when I logged in but since I have been there numerous times and I really love this place I decided to go ahead.  I make my own pizza most of the time and everyone raves about how good it is but as far as I am concerned this is the BEST pizza in all of Arizona.  The crust is light and crispy, the toppings are fresh and flavorful and above all interesting.  I read an article in the Arizona Republic about how the vendors at the farmers market save their best for Chris Bianco (who last I knew personally shopped for the ingredients every day) because they like him so much and respect him.  I totally believe that.  I don't like the wait when you got there during busy time but I have to respect that he keeps the place small and the quality high.Great service 
Food was delicious 
Great atmosphere 
Friendly staff 
99 cent chicken & chorizo tacos
Very clean

Highly recommend the seafood 
Ceviche fish & shrimp, shrimp cocktailsNot impressed with there food and drinks.  Las Vegas rolls  we're  greasy and soggy, yuck, ,drinks were not shaken write 
Just poor experience all around. Victoria  the manager is a pretentious type to say the least.All in all should give 1 star but feeling generous todayBar correct pour avoir votre dose de chicken wings et  pintes de guiness.
C'est un endroit cool pour ramener son groupe de potes et voir les derniers matchs.
PS: ils ne prennent pas la debit card.


Decent joint to have your fix of chicken wings and pint of guiness. 
It's a cool place to bring your group of friends and watch the game.
PS : they don't take debit.I love that place.. Their ingredients are fresh and it taste like a real falafel that you usually eat in middle east. I loved the Idea of having a baked healthy choice of falafel. 
The tabbouleh is not the best but wasn't bad. 
The place is so clean.and most important part they have deliveryWhen only a serious cut of beef will do, prepared and served by another (instead of your backyard grill)--go to Fleming's. Very nice restaurant with professional waiters, a great menu, and tasty wine list.

Although, I've eaten several fine meals at Fleming's, the reason for this recent review is a new discovery: the PINNACLE of hamburgers for $6 dollars at happy hour. A half pound Prime meat hamburger, with smoked bacon, and choice of cheddar, gruyere or blue cheese on a toasted challah bun. Damnation!! best hamburger I've ever eaten. Did I mention 6 bucks at happy hour? Phenomenal.Came to this place my first night in Montreal with a group of friends and it was definitely a good pick. Our waiter was really cool and friendly. The food was well 4 out of 5. The meatballs were good but the arancino and antipasti plate were slightly underwhelming, but by no means bad. The main course, think it was penne with prosciutto more than made up for it. 

Only thing that was a negative was the front staff\/manager? Even though we were a group of five and the restaurant was 85% empty, they were trying to sit us in a small table for four. Basically had to argue with the guy to get us a larger table. No reason for that.Do not get a salad. I had the Mexican Caesar and I was sick right after eating it. The dressing was so gross, it tasted like mayonnaise. The cucumbers were warm. The chips were so greasy and the salsa wasn't anything to brag about.Very low quality food. This might be an ok place for drinks but definitely not for food. We had the fried chicken sandwich which was below average and we got the Zen bowl that was extremely salty. When we told our server, she said that the dish is supposed to be very salty!!!!
We all came home feeling unsatisfied, heavy, and we all agreed that we would never go back again!We were up in Mesa for a swim event and after surveying our group- the consensus was that we wanted Chinese food. 

Trusting my good pal Yelp so show us the way, we agreed to go to Golden Valley Chinese Restaurant for four reasons. 

1. It had 4 stars.

2.  The pictures looked delicious. 

3. It was within our budget.

4. It was located close to where we were. 

Upon arriving into the shopping center, we noticed that here were several cars outside. Always a good sign. It was about 6:45 or so, on a Saturday evening. We entered and were immediately greeted by a friendly employee and were seated in a corner. The six of us fit into the booth comfortably and were asked what drinks we wanted. 

The menu has many options but we agreed on egg drop soup, vegetable lo mein, and vegetable fried rice. The other members in our party ordered orange chicken, sesame chicken, and vegetable lo mein. When the food came, we were taken back by how big the portions were. The value is excellent. We fed three people off our two entrees and soup and had plenty to take back with us. In addition, the food was delicious. 

I would definitely recommend Golden Valley Chinese Restaurant.I just moved to Lakewood and checked out TJ's after reading the Yelp reviews.  Love, love this place for their sandwiches and customer service.  They cook their roast beef, corned beef and pastrami in house.  OMG, what a difference!  They have so many sandwiches to choose from.  The only sandwich I would not recommend is their seafood salad.    However, they let you sample things before you buy, which is nice so you don't end up spending $$ on something you don't care for.  They have many other products I'd like to try, such as homemade sausage and kielbasa, stuffed chicken.  This place beats the many other well known chain restaurants nearby.  Definitely check this place out!!I have had take out from this place and been there for lunch. Both times were two thumbs up. The pad Thai was absolutely delicious! It is very reasonably priced and the restaurant itself was superclean.The service was fabulous and they were so kind to our young daughter who was there with us. I would highly recommend Arroyo Thai as it is probably the best Thai food we have here in Ahwatukee.Worst experience we've had in a long time. My family was in town for a celebration of life as a family member had passed away. We decided we wanted to go somewhere with a good selection of food where we could talk and have a meal together. There were going to be 9 in our party so a couple of my family members went early to get our name on the list. They handed us a pager and we proceeded to all meet in the bar and stood around a tiny table. They would not seat us until there was at least 6 of our party there. When 5 arrived we checked on the table as it had been about an hour at this point. The hostess alerted us that the other party members had already been seated. We went back but much to our surprise they had not seated our party they had given our table away. They questioned us and asked us if we were sure!!!! Uh yea we know who we were going to meet for dinner!!! Turns out the hostess didn't check the pager and it wasn't working. We sat a little longer in the bar and asked to speak to the manager. She came up and basically told us the same thing.....we all looked at each other like DUH idiot we know there's someone sitting at our table but what are you going to do about it? She told us basically we would just have to wait. We found it hard to believe that there wasn't a single other section where you could put two tables together. Most of us are pretty irate by now because it's been an hour and forty five minutes. The manager tried to smooth things over by telling us when we got seated, if ever at this point we could have free appetizers. We questioned her again about what she could do because really none of us wanted to even eat there. We decided to walk out and will not ever go back to that restaurant again. Talk about a lack of communication and mismanagement. I'd give half a star if I could. I worked in the food service industry and have never encountered such an incompetent manager.Was in Laval on business and this place was close to the hotel.  I have to admit that living in Vancouver, I'm used to cheap AND good sushi.  In the rest of Canada, it's one or the other it seems.

Torii had a fairly decent menu selection.  It's your standard sashimi and nigiri selections and the rolls you're used to at any other sushi joint.  The fish seemed fairly fresh.  (for fish in a landlocked city)  Presentation was nice but it was a bit on the pricier side when compared to Vancouver, which to be honest, I can't really fault them for.  The service was fairly good though I was hoping they would come refill my drinks more often than just twice during my meal.  With so much other unique foods in Montreal, I'm not sure I'd make another stop here next time around.could  have been better or maybe i just got the wrong thing i will try something else next time because the sub i got was bland i felt like i could have made something like that myself at home and it would have tasted better. i think next time i will keep it simple and go with pizza or jo'sjo's and chicken.Horrible experience,  manager was unfamiliar with new brunch law.      I feel as a restaurant manager you'd be aware of the laws.  He was more interested in arguing with the customer    Food was served cold and they werent busy at all.  I will not be returning.    I recommend elsewhere for your mexican cravings!!!The Burrito Shack will not disappoint you. Don't let the exterior fool you. I live in the area and pass the Shack on a daily basis. Seamed to be closed until I learned their hours of operation,  6:30 - 2. The burritos are all ways freshly made and the staff as cheerful as can be. Always a pleasant experience.Great food and service.  We had a table of 7 and everyone was happy with their meal.  I had the tagliatelle bolognese that was very tasty.  My girlfriend had a truly incredible pork chop that was not part of the regular menu but was the days special.  Funghi salad was flavourful but tough and overcooked.   We will be back!My husband, my kids, and I rarely have any time altogether and we decided to dine at Benihana's Chandler tonight. The service was ok. The server was on top of things, but she had a strange, "cocky" attitude. Made me very uncomfortable... and it's tough to explain. Mainly sarcasm and very passive with us. Then our chef showed up, and right when he started the "show", he accidentally tossed a spatula into my daughters lap. From there, no tricks at all! It was a 110% boring experience. 
The entire table (my husband, my 2 kids & I), and another family of 4) sat there quiet waiting for some kind of entertainment from the chef to take place. That's what Benihana is all about, right!? And to top it off, the food was under seasoned and had no flavor.

I honestly think our chef was new, and needed some training. But in that case, he shouldn't be placed on the floor on the busiest day of the week (Saturday). We paid over $220, and it was not even worth it... I'm sorry to say. :-(Came here last night absolutely fabulous food and our bartender Chase was awesome he made my husband one of the best old fashions he's ever had we will be back tonight xGreat place to go for lunch\/brunch, very reasonable prices for their pasta dishes (10$), not to mention absolutely delicious!  I always stop by the attached market and grab some cannolis for desert :)Color me surprised to find decent Indian food in Ohio, especially when it's described as "fast food." I got a paneer tikka masala, my mom got a chicken plate. I really enjoyed the sauces on the side, especially the mint yogurt; I tried the Choolah Fire sauce and was disappointed at how mild it was. Alas. I do like me some spice. 

Everything I ate was tasty and well-sized; I left feeling full but not bloated, despite having eaten every last bite. I almost opted to get a mango lassi, but once I saw that customize-your-own soda machine, I knew I had to just get that. I'm a sucker for pressing buttons.  

I wish I had one of these places near me so I could hit them up for weekday lunches; it's the perfect quick meal that is super satisfying and doesn't drain your wallet.We went for a birthday. I put that fact in our reservation notes but it was not acknowledged. First time at this restaurant and the experience was less than stellar. Our server - Ruger - was MIA all night. He came back once to ask if we wanted more drinks...which was about 45 minutes into our dinner. Took our orders and then disappeared. Someone else brought out our food, put it on the table, and walked away. We had no silverware to eat with. Took us another 5 minutes to flag someone down so we could actually begin eating our meal. My sandwich order, which is not a difficult dish, was missing the bacon, and ordered no mustard, which was abundantly spread on my food. It appears no one really cares what the customer orders, nor actually servicing the patrons who are sitting there eating. Sorry to be so harsh, but it was a very disappointing experience having been there for the first time. :-\/Matt's was the perfect breakfast after a wedding the night before. The food is delicious and high quality. I loved the taste of all of the ingredients. I had the chicken sandwich and the breast meat was juicy, and paired fantastically with the pesto sauce.Now, let me preface this by saying that my favorite restaurants are the ones that find ways to make healthy foods taste amazing.  That being said, there wasn't much that was healthy about this place.  

Being vegetarian, I ordered the only meatless panini, a Triple Double Melt--which was a ginormous double layer grilled cheese sandwich with 3 layers of French Country Bread and 2 layers of cheese, all grilled in butter (I had them add tomatoes so I'd have some semblance of greenery).  The best part about it was definitely the bread...but it wasn't amazing enough in my opinion to justify all the empty calories and fat.  I also ordered the one vegetarian soup option--which was an artichoke portobello soup.  The soup literally looked and tasted like Thanksgiving gravy; it was thick, gray, and much too creamy with like 3 random chunks of vegetables.  If I had some mashed potatoes, it probably would've been awesome on top...but just not as a soup! :\/ 

They DO have a rather awesome dessert case filled with all sorts of cakes, cookies, caramel apples, etc.  Since Valentine's Day was approaching, I thought I'd be festive and order a heart-shaped sugar cookie.  Unfortunately, the sugar cookie (while cute) was rather mediocre.  There were lots of other treats that looked yummy though.

In summary, if you're looking to indulge, you'd probably love it here.  Great bread (hence the name Kneader's), lots of beautiful desserts, cute little tchotchkes for sale, and nice staff.  But as someone who tries to eat semi-healthy foods, I felt like my arteries were crying for help when I left.  Don't think I'll be back here for any food but perhaps to buy a cute pastry for a special occasion.Good atmosphere but can get rather loud because it's small.  Sushi was good.  However do not...I repeat DO NOT....go to this restaurant within a week of a Groupon expiring.  We went 2 days before ours expired and they were not at all prepared for the crowd.  The hostess was rude (probably losing her mind), they only had 2 servers, and all of a sudden a guy I presumed to be the manager started taking charge.  He was short with people, saying things like, "I can't seat you at the sushi counter because you wouldn't get service."  The servers were running around like crazy, forgetting people's orders, not knowing what table the food went to, etc.  We put in our order of edamame and 3 sushi rolls and finally received our food in 30 minutes.  All at one time, unfortunately, and there wasn't room at the table.  Nobody came by to refill our water, and the servers so were crazy busy it was just chaotic.  

By the way, you don't need a groupon for this place.  Every Wed night is "Groupon Night" where you get $30 of sushi for $15.  So skip buying it and go on a Wednesday if you can deal with the crowd and lack of service.  Thank God the food is good. 

Giving 2 stars because of management's lack of response to a busy restaurant.  If it were just for the food I'd give it 4 stars.I was actually lost looking to go meet a dude at YARDHOUSE and Saturday night around 8:15 Nov 22 the two drop dead beautiful young dark haired girls were kind enough to realize I'm lost and offer me directions then invited me back for a drink after my date!!!!  Amazing cus service!  Seriously!  I'm a cocktail server and I'll spread the word!So I get that when you order from UberEATS places tend to half ass their orders, but this is terrible. I ordered a yellow chicken curry, and it was just liquid with maybe six carrots and one piece of chicken. The sauce tasted fine but I didn't pay $15 for sauce!One if my favorite local spots. Very kinda staff, fresh food and always affordable. I usually get Mediterranean chicken salad, blue corn chicken nachos, Spicy chicken wrap and Chicken DeL Sol.This place is just Okay. It's close to my house so I've eaten here quite a few times. The best items I've had are the breakfast burritos, they actually are pretty good and available all day.

My biggest issue with this place is the meat. When you order something with meat on it, they do put a lot on there but, its just not that good. The chicken is always tough, stringy and chewy. The carnitas is an odd consistency, more like chipped beef, not like the shredded\/pulled pork consistency it should be and its very greasy. The carne asada is tough but the best meat option (besides the bacon) in my opinion.

The pico de gallo is mostly cilantro, way too much for my tastes but if you like cilantro you'll love their pico.It's taco bell & consistant same menu. As long as my order is correct I'm psyched & guess what it was! Woo Hoo!HTC of Tempe is the best place to get dermals done!!
I was very nervous to get my hip dermals but KAT the senior piercer there was Amazing!!!
She had my dermals done in about a minit flat, I barley even felt the pain it was soo quick!!
Luv her , and I'm going back for more and only she will touch me!!
5 stars for KAT!!!I really like this place , I went at night on a Wednesday with my lady. The place is so cool and it's awesome that they have all day happy hour on Wednesday. The vibe outside is so cool and it's perfect to have a few drinks on any arizona night. The drinks were ok a lot of sugar and soda but they were cheap so it's ok. We didn't try the food but I definitely will next time the menu seemed good with a lot of options. The bartender was so cool and polite and very accommodating and that was the highlight along with the music and people there, that day. It's a really nice bar and a good spot to check out , I'll will go again and try a few more things for sure.I love this place. The food is awesome (especially the German pancake). The decor is so cute. My only complaint is the restaurant is so small and there is always a wait.  I'm moving back to the Phoenix area soon and will definitely miss this gem of a restaurant.  I hope more locations will open soon.Loved their Wine Dinner on Wednesday!  The food was so delicious as always and the owner Dennis and Diane both were so nice and friendly. Definitely will go back there again.I continue to be impressed here with foods. Just had a vegee crepe and added chicken breast and pesto. Was excellent with a Pelligrino water. I always try to get here whenever near.I think I lived at this Starbucks for the last year that I lived in AZ. I love the outdoor patio and the chairs and couches inside are always comfy. I never got harrassed by the employees about hanging around for like 3 hours or chilling out in the front making lots of noise with friends. There usually isn't a line, because this isn't a busy Starbucks. There's also the random magazine stands right in front of the store which are handy if you feel like reading something, but forgot a book.  The parking lot kinda sucks, but there's like 10 other stores using the same lot. One of my favourite Starbucks.I was a little irritated that I was eating at a chain restaurant while in Las Vegas, but it was my cousin's anniversary dinner so of course, she gets to pick.  After being grumbly about the situation, I actually REALLy enjoyed my meal.  I had just recently eaten at another PF Changs, but this experience was much better.  

Because we had two couples we each ordered the meals for two and shared everything.  I had the egg drop soup and it was REALLY good.  I also had a taste of the wonton soup.  Also good, but I do love egg drop soup!  We had these yummy pan fried pork dumplings and chicken lettuce wraps to start and then we all shared the Pepper Steak, Crispy Honey Chicken, Crispy Honey Shrimp, and Mongolian beef.  My cousin also added a noodle dish.  OH MY GOSH!  Way too much food!  But it all tasted really good and we really enjoyed the meal.  There were two boxes of food to take home afterwards.

The service was timely and attentive, even thought the restaurant was quite busy.  We had a reservation, so there was no wait to be seated.  

I would definitely recommend this restaurant to someone looking for Asian food at the Planet Hollywood.  It's a chain, but it is good, I admit it!

WHAT CAN THEY DO TO GET FIVE STARS?
~Not be a chain restaurant?  I don't think that's entirely fair, but for me what makes a five star restaurant is something unique.  I can eat at a PF Changs any time, anywhere, so that takes away a little something from the experience.Would love to give negative stars! My wife and I are regulars so this was truly unexpected!  We brought our friends from out of town to bring them here because their noodles are really tasty. The six of us get there to a place that's not extremely busy but busy. The hostess told us it would be a 20 minute wait. So we waited. The hostess then asks if it's ok to seat a couple before us and it would not effect our wait time.  Well it did.... 

Because she sat some more before us. So our 20 minute wait turned to 45. When we asked the hostess about this she didn't remember seating those people. We complained to her about the situation and how we were upset and she did not care. My wife went to another restaurant Mercadito and asked if they could seat us right away and about are situation..

While she was doing that I asked for the manager. When the hostess told the manager that I wanted to talk to her she rolled her eyes as I was a bother. As I explained to her the situation and that we were regulars and how we have been treated thus far she did not once apologize. While talking to her she did even look me in the eyes half the time!  She didn't try to make it better she kept telling me she wasn't aware of the situation. She thanked me for my complaint!!  Maybe if she would come out of her office she would know!! So at that time my wife tells me Mercadito will seat us right away and pay for a round of drinks for our trouble!

So the story concludes with we will never be back and that the service is horrible and the manager and hostess should be fired!  If they worked at my business, wait they would never work at my business!I love everything about it... Small place but clean, the service is always glad to serve you even the difficult costumer... 
The food lets talk about the food mmmm all the time every one of the different items I have chosen have been delicious and fresh.I can't say that this is one of my favorite nor I dislike it either. It is one of those restaurant that we tried and it was ok but won't come back because there was nothing special about it. I love Korean BBQ don't get me wrong but we told the server that it was our first time and did not seem to personalize our experience nor offered anything in menu to try or anything that stands out in the menu or restaurant's famous dishes etc.I met up with some coworkers on Saturday before the Coyotes game for drinks and dinner here. My drink of choice was the Raspberry Cider, and for my meal I decided on the Spicy Chicken Breast sandwich with fries. The sandwich was a nice thought but it had some flaws - the flat bread was good, but too thick\/fluffy to handle all of the insides. Also, the seasoning on the chicken was more salty than spicy. Either way I was starving so I sucked it up and ate most of it. The service was good and they have heaters on the patio which was nice.We eat at a different restaurant in the Charlotte area every Saturday with friends. But on Friday nights, we keep going back to Zen Asian Fusion. The food, atmosphere and service are exceptional. The Tre Ci Luce Cake is my favorite desert.This restaurant aims to please. The food is fantastic. I've been 3 times, and it will continue to be a place I bring guests from out of town.I had the taco parilla and it was small. Tasted good but there wasn't much of it. Why so skimpy with the rice?  3 tortilla chips? Really?  Having waited for 30 minutes for the food I expected much more and better. 

The worst part is the loud Latino beats music where every song sounds exactly the same. Of course they have to blast it. My two year old says, "it's too loud!".  "Yes dear it is too loud!"  

Overall a very distasteful dining experience.  I couldn't wait to get out and I'm still hungry. Sigh.This is some of the best Ramen and the BBQ short ribs are delicious for really cheap. Definitely recommend this place!Food is pretty good and service is good as well. Its my second time visiting this place while I stayed at Westgate. I just dont like my check being brought to me in the middle of me eating and not being asked if I wanted anything else, before printing out my check and bringing it to me.Amazing!!!!!!!!! Creative menu items. Way too much food for one person. Lovely outdoor dining area. Excellent customer service.I used to be a huge fan of Himalayan... that was before the renovations that took place in 2014. Back then, the food was amazing and the ambiance was exceptional - despite being in a strip mall.

Fast forward after the renos, the place has become more like a luxury boutique. I really disliked the fact that they added pork items in their menu (not really popular in India\/Nepal, therefore a step backwards in terms of authenticity in my opinion). Also, I noticed that the portions became smaller and prices went up after the renovations, I guess an attempt to cut costs and recover what was spent in the renos but still the experience has never been the same as when I used to visit at least a couple of times per month.Had scrambled eggs, bacon & potatoes for breakfast. Food was definitely below average...hard to screw up bacon and eggs (and they were fine) but the toast wasn't even toasted and potatoes had no seasoning at all. How hard is it to throw a little salt and pepper on the potatoes?

Service was fast and efficient... No problems there.This place is great, and the other yelpers must not have had our server, busser, and manager.  My cousin and I walked from MGM to Bellagio and were really hungry, so we hesitantly walked into Caesar's "Café." They only had 3.5 stars, and I saw on yelp that their service was bad and their food overpriced. SO WRONG. My cousin had the chicken fingers w\/ fries and got like 4 different sauces for $16. Expensive? Wrong! It was so much food and she took half of it home so in my opinion, it was like an $8 meal. I'm vegan, but my server, despite needing to take an order for a table of 12, patiently explained to me even more vegan options which expanded my options to about 9. At a lot of restaurants I go to, servers typically just offer me 1-2 modifications with an attitude. I ultimately settled on the spaghetti with giant meatballs but got the meatballs replaced with veggies. Our server also made sure that they didn't put Parmesan cheese in my spaghetti and gave me bread and olive oil to replace the usual nonvegan garlic bread that comes with the meal. Service stayed good throughout the whole meal, even though the place was short-staffed as we later found out after having a chat with Suda, the manager. She said that three people called in sick probably because it was Christmas night. Anyway, I had a good experience overall and would give more than five stars if I could!I also ate at Tao, and it's goodness barely, barely offsets the horror of its nightclub enough to get starts. 

The food was incredibly expensive, but it was delicious. I had lobster dumplings and pad thai, both were great. My friends all ordered the sea bass or the fillet Mignon. I forced them to let me have a bite and they were also amazing. Dessert was the lava cake, chocolate spring rolls and fortune cookie, and even though I was full I forced myself to keep eating. 

Our waiter was funny and had good recommendations about the menu. So yeah. Dining there hit my wallet, but made my tummy so happy.

Our dinner reservation included "priority" entrance to the club upstairs. The club made no party of me happy. 

I'd wager 90% of the club's real estate is devoted to bottle service. I don't know if having bottle service would make this place more fun or not, because we didn't want it. We were in Vegas for a bachelorette party and just wanted to go club hopping and have the "whoooo, we're going dancing in Vegas!" experience. 

Incidentally, you cannot have that experience at Tao, because Tao is where the "Whoooo we're going dancing" feeling goes to die. 

The non bottle service areas belong to overcrowded hallways and a tiny little dance floor. The logistics of the floor are so genius that to exit Tao, you must cross the dance floor. Looking for an exit strategy to get across is akin to what I think Moses felt when he first looked at the Red Sea: "how the eff do I get across this thing?!" 

It's an awful set up not only for people looking to run away to a better club, but also for those who decide to squeeze onto the dance floor to actually dance. Be prepared for these inevitabilities: You will get someone shoved into you as if you were in a mosh pit. A girl will step on your feet with her heels. You will smashed up against your friends and strangers in such close proximity it could be labeled as "extremely intimate." 

Vegas is packed with clubs and packed with restaurants. No matter how good dinner was here, I would pick any of those places over Tao every time... and I'd probably have more fun.Great Favor! Just got off the plane from Chicago and wanted something simple but good. This place hit the spot!!! Spicy Chicken was perfect with bursting favors. I will be coming back my next time back! Great service!Food is good but not great.  I ordered the waffle and chicken which came out on a huge plate.  Their serving size can feed for two.  The waffles had bacon in it and the chicken is deep fried.  The waffles was not as crunchy as I liked to be.  The chicken was good and not as greasy as KFC.  They have a weird fee if you share your plate.  I think it was like $2 for sharing a plate.  You can avoid it by adding a side dish.  Overall, I wouldn't come back.  Drinks were outrageous, $4 for orange juice.Been going to this Thai BBQ for 15 yrs. You know it's a great place when the menu has never changed and Our fav waiter has been here forever! When he sees us he even knows what we always order. s1and s2!!!It's a good thing The Improper Pig isn't close to my house because I'd have a haaaard time not going all the time if it were. The fella and I ventured over on a Wednesday night around 8:00, and we were immediately greeted by a super nice, chatty host. He seated us, and our waitress appeared just a few minutes later.

It took me forever to decide what I wanted because everything looked so good! I finally landed on the Chow Bao Taco with pulled pork and a side of Brussels sprouts. The taco came in a steamed bao bun, which I've never had before, and it was doughy but delicious and light. The pulled pork was so fresh, too! I could've eaten 3 more of them. The sprouts were okay, but nothing to write home about.

The fella went with the pulled pork & slaw sandwich (which he figured was like Mac's Lil Pig) and a side of spicy green beans. He said the beans were good but the sandwich beats Mac's... a bold statement for the fella. 

The atmosphere was pretty cool with a comfy wooden\/aluminum vibe, there was easy parking in the Costwold lot, and they had fair prices. The beer selection was just okay, but the bourbon list was pretty awesome (except there weren't prices on those... hmmm).I was not disappointed .......... the service and food were Very Good.

                  You'll find a  Quality Meal ....... with Quality Prices.
                  From the Hostess to the Servers ........ its all Ten's. 

About the Food ...... Throughout my life ..... I've had better Italian.
This is Upscale Dinning ....... its more about the experience ...... then the Food.
Conversations with your tablemates ....... are almost impossible ..... Extremely Noisy. 

        By all means ........ Try it Once ........ Then decide for yourself about return visits. 

                       Me ......... I'll be back ....... every 2 or 3 months.The Trump Towers is a hotel trying to be a five star hotel, but it just misses the mark. It kind of reminds me of Donald Trump's hair. Maybe from really far away--like the center of the strip--it looks ok. However, up close and personal, you see its flaws. 

Don't get me wrong. This is a nice place to stay. The Jacuzzi tub was sweet. And, I could use the bathroom while my wife was using the vanity or taking a shower because the bathroom has three rooms in it. Yes, I know she is my wife, but let's keep a little mystery going in the world.7.99 wing combo!
Carribean jerk fusion wings.
Garlic Parmesan fries.
Tasty Ranch sauce.
Absolutely love this place.
Food was fresh and HOT.I just absolutely love this place. They have the best food here. Billy and Tammy are the friendliest bartender and waitress around. I have never had a bad meal here. I usually get the 16oz. Ribeye and eggs. The steak is gigantic and very flavorful. I love the burgers, nachos, and wings there also. Jackson's bar and grill is literally a diamond in the desert. Do yourself a favor, and go enjoy some cocktails, video poker, and some wonderful people.One word. Incredible. Great food and atmosphere. One of the best Vegan or Vegetarian restaurants I have ever been too, period. Lots of creative items to choose from. I hade the Mushroom Carpaccio to start - better than the real thing. Gnocchi for main course - excellent preparation and flavors. 

Glutenberg gluten free IPA in a can - surprisingly satisfying. I would make it my go to beer if I could find it back in Michigan. Attention Michigan craft brewers - consider tapping into the gluten free market. (Pun intended)

I gave it 4 stars but it's really 5. I don't want to give the impression that I just give out 5 stars to everything I like. However, if I come back and have a similar experience I am sure lov can earn 5 stars  - no problem. 

I look forward to eating at lov again on my next visit to beautiful Montreal!Buca De Beppo is a great place to go with all of your friends. I'm sick of being penalized with waits or reservations when a group of friends and I want to go out to eat at the last minute. Buca De Beppo however is different. With a family style menu and a mansion of a restaurant I have always got in very quickly. 

As I mentioned the menu is made to be ordered in either medium or large portions. The Medium portions are for about two or three people and the large are more around four or five. Last time I was there we had polenta and garlic breadf or appetizers. For entrees we had Caesar salad, chicken parmesan, and the manacotti. This was for six starving people. The chicken Parmesan is unlike any I have had. Instead of a basic fried chicken breast they  grill it and top it off with fresh tomato sauce and a little sprinkled cheese. The manacotti was also delicious and the cheese was so filling I could barely finish one.

 Our waitress was a bit flighty but she was nice. The ambiance of Buca is also very interesting you won't spend a dull moment at your table because the walls are engrossed with quirky photographs.Doshi will be the next short-lived food trend, I just know it.

With so many food options near our hotel, Square Fish stood out because of its newness and strong profile. Donut sushi called doshi?? Who wouldn't be able to resist. With no wait, we took the server's rec and ordered a salmon doshi.

Preparation was decently fast and our picture perfect snack was a sight to be seen. It looked more like a burger with sushi rice buns, and the eating experience was something else. We warned how messy it'd be and she wasn't kidding. The bun instantly fell apart when we tried to handle it and I'd recommend using the wrapper to wrap it up and keep it together.

Flavor-wise, I was very very impressed. It was more of a poke experience versus a sushi experience. There was a strong emphasis on salads and toppings versus the actual fish. The seaweed and crab salads were quite tasty, but I wished there was more fish. The sandwich ultimately costs $7ish USD, which I thought was more than fair for the portion.

Snack in and grab one before your Instagram floods with photos of them!This is one of the greatest restaurants I have gone in Canada. Tried their golden beef curry and this weirdly named Islamic noodles with Sapporo. Food is reasonably priced and extremely tasty here! One can go there every week!I recently stopped here for lunch on my way back from Utah, and I must say, the quality of food and level of customer service were beyond superb!!The website is being redesigned and with little info on Yelp page, it looks like the place is closed but NOT THE CASE!
This is a small family run business who specializes in all types of seafood but especially the lobster from Les Îles de la Madelaine.
Lobster season starts in three weeks, can't wait!!We enjoyed everything; the waiter was knowledgeable, and professional. The tapas was wonderful. We had the Chicken and Seafood Paella and the Seafood Stew. Both were outstanding! We had no room for dessert, but the variety looked very tempting. We will be back!I just ordered here for the first time tonight--the Everything Pizza is soooooo delish!!!! Everything was so fresh and very tasty! My kids got the cheese pizza and loved it! Great portions! I am definitely coming back again!!! Awesome pizza!Good pizza! Awesome building!  So-So beer.

There are better microbrews by a long shot in Pittsburgh such as East End and Full Pint.   The Church Brew Works beer is average at best.

The pizza is great, the rest of the food is going to be solid as well.

Of course you go here for the fantastic building, and that part does not disappoint.

This is not going to be your regular haunt, but it's a great place to take an out of town visitor.I came to Zest with my family for my Birthday and I must say, THE BEST FOOD IN VEGAS. Everything was perfect and our server paired our dishes with the right wine. Nicole is very attentive and honestly I would go back just for her. Thank you for making my birthday such a memorable experience you'll definitely see me again.Really disappointed in this place. Had heard good things from friends and liked that it was in the northwest area. The waitresses were confused. Place was barren. Didn't think anyone could mess up Tempura Vegetables but I guess I was wrong. Waitress comes up with a few rolls and I ask her which was which..blank stare..she's confused.. I finally tell her I'll just figure it out myself, no big deal. The fish tasted like it came from a can. Nothing fresh about it. Had to take a sick day from work the next day because I felt so ill. Maybe this was just an off night for them but I will not be returning.I'd actually been to California Thai a few years ago and I remember ordering one of their variations on Pad Thai and absolutely hating it. But this afternoon I found myself in the Yonge\/Dundas food court and I thought surely it's not gonna be as bad as I remember. And sure enough, it wasn't as bad.

It was worse.

I ordered the Classic Pad Thai and waited probably a minute while it was prepared. An intimidatingly large portion comes packaged in a styrofoam container, which, at least, ensures the whole thing stays hot while you're eating it.

The first bite was an unmitigated disaster. I opened the container and was immediately slapped in the face with a smell that reminded me of stale fish. And that's what it tastes like, too.

This is a flavorless concoction that's just a complete salt bomb. There isn't a single flavor in here that reminded me of any version of Pad Thai I've ever had. (And I've had a lot of Pad Thai over the years.)

I managed to eat maybe a third of this trainwreck before I had to throw in the towel and toss what was left. And I'm a pig; I'll eat just about anything!

Worst. Pad Thai. Ever.ate here a couple of weeks ago... i am a fan of all of mike symons places and his newest is also very good.  When going to any of symon places you must eat pork it is the law and bar symon holds true to form,  we started with a bar snack of flavored popcorn i wanted the pork rinds but got out voted by my girlfriend. it was good but not great.  we then moved on to the pork crouton salad and it was amazing.  wonderful roasted pork belly a perfectly poached egg served on top of very nice salad it was heaven on a plate.  for dinner i had the skirt steak it was very good and my girlfriend had the fried chicken which was also very good.  worth the stop.. the two down falls are the location in a strip mall and it is not nearly as cute loltias or as fancy as lolasSo - I'm not sure what happened over the past year.  The menu has changed for one.  My buffalo chicken sandwich was just a breaded fried patty with hot sauce drizzled like ketchup might be on a burger, but it was cooked properly and a decent piece of meat.  Fries were serviceable.  Kids' burger was fine.  But the big surprise was that my fish taco-crazy wife loved her fish tacos.

"So you're saying I got a chance..."Great place for lunch.  I've only had the General Tso's chicken and it is consistently good.  Minor complaint....the music.Good food at a reasonable price. I am always leary of chain restaurants but this place was good. Sat at the bar and enjoyed a margarita pizza and a glass of Pinot Grigio.I have been eating sushi since I was a child all over the East coast.  The atmosphere of this place was great, very friendly staff.  Sushi menu had a decent size selection.  I will say that it was overpriced in my opinion.  The sushi was pretty good but I've had better quality and quantity for far less, even in bigger cities.  I was disappointed after spending $45 (3 items) that I was still hungry.  Very disappointed that a Japanese restaurant didn't have fresh brewed ice tea.  I would come back if invited but won't be venturing back on my own.One of the best restaurants in toronto 

i have been here over 10 times and every time had an amazing experience! the owners are very nice and always willing to help you find the perfect dish for you. 

the food is a great fusion of flavours from across Asia 

Dont let it being hidden away in the food court prevent you from trying this hidden gemAte lunch here today with my friend. We ordered the scallion pancake, veg spring rolls & tempura shrimp to start. The starters were ok, but not great. Everything was a little on the greasy side. The scallion pancake had delicious sauce. 

For lunch I had veggie stir fried ramen & my friend had lobster noodle soup. I don't eat a lot of oil & my ramen was so greasy it gave me a stomach ache. It also had eggs in it which was not on the menu. My friend enjoyed her soup. If I come back I will order the soup but stay away from anything fried.

We did not have dim sum but the cart did come around to our table.

Service was pretty good. Everyone was nice & attentive. I wouldn't come back just for this restaurant but if I'm in downtown summerlin & get hungry I'd probably stop by for a bowl of soup.When you first arrived at the outside the restaurant, it doesn't look impressive. The dim sum is served in one of the catering room.  The decor is modern inside.  I've tried a lot of dim sum restaurants in The U.S., Hong Kong and Canada.  Shangri-la's dim sum is made to order. You check off a paper with what you want to eat. It is fresh, and their presentation for each plate is done well with each dishes.  I especially liked the fried tofu rice crueller.  The har-kow was jumbo size. A must try.  The chicken feet was spicier with a kick.  The prices were reasonable compared to other dim sum restaurants. We tried La Kwai Heen downtown, much more pricier, with exotic meat. It it tasted the same as any other dim sum.Came on a Saturday night but still wasn't that crowded. However, once we ordered a mixed drink and a glass of wine, it took 15 minutes before Ebony came to tell us they were out of the wine we ordered, so we got a lemonade instead. Then, after 10 more minutes we got the mixed drink that came in a martini glass..half full...for $10. Still didn't have the lemonade, because she told the table next to us they were waiting for glasses to be washed and they had ran out. By the time the lemonade was delivered I had finished my half full martini and ordered 2 Belgian white beers (might as well order 2 since it takes so long), to which Ebony asked "do you mean the Shock Top or hefeweizen?". (I said the Belgian white because that's exactly what it was called on the menu), but I responded hefeweizen. Instead I was brought 2 shock top...15 minutes later. We asked if we could move outside because even though it was just the two of us, we were sat at a table that was 6 inches from another couples table and felt like we were practically on top of the strangers they sat next to us. When we finally got our food- it was somewhat good, which is why they're getting 2 stars. However, the portions were ridiculously small for the prices they charged. 4 scallops for $22? Our meal was obviously quick once we received our food, and we won't be back. $95 before tip (which I only did out of good conscious and not out of performance by our server) was rediculous.Seven Lives? Well, of course! It's a delicious take out place. It's not really a restaurant since the seating space is very, very limited. If you haven't you should pay a visit. Whenever I go I pick up two tacos for myself, usually a gobernador and a squid taco, and go to Kensington Park to sit down on the grass and eat. It's a bit more convenient to have take out here now that they take debit\/credit. 

The tacos are on the big side, quite loaded up. Each one is wrapped in two maize tortillas.  There's a bit of cream in the sauces that go in them. The tacos here are pretty similar to seafood tacos I've had in Mexico.  Yummy!Every once in a while my wife has been dragging me here and I have chiefly disliked the enormous quantity of food you get with a single entry. Today, when we were ordering omlettes the waitress asked us if we would like them with 2 or 4 eggs. We said 2 eggs and therefore got a reasonable size meal. (They also came with potatoes or fruit and a muffin or toast.) The smaller option wasn't on the menu--it was a couple of bucks cheaper--and, possibly, the waitress only offered it to us because she sized us up as seniors. However, getting a reasonably sized omlette makes this a much more attractive place for me. I found the veggie omlette quite good and with two eggs right sized. The selection of fresh fruits was also good.Good place to grab breakfast that doesn't cost a fortune.Cozy, laid back, atmosphere in the dining room yet still buzzing and lively. Friendly, efficient service. Not a surly staff-member anywhere; none of the cloying, ingratiating types either. Food was simply prepared. Fresh, with an authentic, homemade and traditional ring. Enough of a variation on the themes to avoid cliche territory and provide a fresh interpretation. Offering is geared towards comforting familiarity and for the unpretentious diner - as I like it.  A high recommendation, particularly when you factor in ease of access by subway or car (lots of Green P parking nearby).Every time I go to Vegas, I have to make a stop at Ellis Island.  Every time I visit Vegas with new friends, I have to take them to Ellis Island!!  It's just that great!  $6.99 for a steak sirloin with two sides and a drink?!  $12.99 for a prime rib dinner with two sides and a drink?!  Not only is it cheap, it's GOOD FOOD and it's open 24 hours!!  The drink includes alcoholic beer or root beer and it's a tall glass that I've never been able to finish.

For the two sides, you get to choose from a salad or soup, both of which are really good.  Their chicken noodle soup isn't lacking in chicken OR vegetables, which I love!  These two sides don't include string beans so it's like you're getting 3 sides!

The last time I came here, there was another special: $8.99 Shrimp Scampi.  I decided to try something new and I'm so glad I did!!  My dinner came with a root beer, house salad, a baked potato with sour cream and butter, garlic bread, and shrimp scampi!  My friends say the root beer is IBC, and they're root beer fanatics so I believe them.  If I'm not getting root beer, then I'm getting Hefeweizen, which is also good!  The house salad came with crispy lettuce and oh so yummy croutons!  The baked potato, unfortunately, didn't come with bacon, cheese, chives and all that good stuff but it was good nonetheless.  The garlic bread was delicious!  It was lightly padded with flavor so it wasn't soggy, and the crust wasn't too hard.  The shrimp scampi was heaven!  There were only 5 pieces but they were HUGE pieces.  They were drenched in butter and oh so juicy.  

I definitely recommend dining at Ellis Island, especially if you want a delicious meal for cheap!!This place is located on the international market plaza with plenty of parking. We were craving for jap chae and bulgogi. The jap chae came out warm and the bulgogi was inside a hot stone. Both were very tasty and filling for 2 people. Will have to try the Korean BBQ next time.I am beyond impressed with this restaurant.  From the moment we walked in until we left my husband and I were blown away by the level of service and the amazing food. Our server, Angel was absolutely amazing. He made excellent recommendations and although we were full, we still ended up ordering dessert (which of course he was absolutely on point with the churros.) Even the manager Ryan came by to say hello and ask how everything was. That was the icing on the cake. We will definitely be back.Good value 
Good service
Great pancakes i had the hazelnut first time
Off the hook!

Really liked the place i would dare to say their pancakes are best in vegasYum.   This place makes an amazing bagel sandy!  Bobs special is amazing.  It's not on the board anymore but it comes with heaps of different types of meat, cream brie, roasted red peppers and many other mouth watering ingredients sure to please!  It's a gem!Went to this restaurant few weeks ago.  The food was great including the desserts.  The service was very good.Love this place.. They always consistent and love how spicy their salsa is .. You can never go wrong with their chilaquiles plate for breakfastYou must like country music and dancing if you go here.  I've been here twice for drinks and dancing with my country-lovin' friends.  I've never eaten here.  The drinks are A-OK, but the people (late night folks) seem to creep out of the crazy pictures on the wall.  Let's just say I try to hide in the corner so no one asks me to dance!Disappointed at the squid ink ramen, $4 extra & soup base is watery.  Go for pork ramen instead!I believe this place is amazing is multiple ways, the drinks are great and there's a really cool vibe. However, this place closes at 7:00 which I think it's super annoying. If you guys were to change that you would make your customers a lot happier. I never get off work before 6:30 and it's impossible to get your service.This is confusing to say the least. JT walkers restaurant and brewery? The brewery is across the street. No real food however, bartender and popcorn make up for it. We went across the street for apps and more beer. It was around 445pm. The lady working behind the bar and also waitressing (?) was so completely rude. She also made it clear that they do not carry all the beers from across the street. She even added that they pay shipping\/delivery charges for beer. When we asked for specific beers that we had at JT walkers breweries, she looked at us like we were stupid. Then replied why would I know what you are talking about?! I simply said that they carried it across the street. She then let me know that they are 2 different businesses. She was so rude to us and proceeded to walk away! 
Meanwhile people kept coming in. Most of them in pajama pants, had plastic cups, singing and dancing to music on their phones. Oh wait! They weren't customers! They proceeded to go behind the bar and fill up there cups while talking and dancing with the waitress\/bartender. Meanwhile, I went to use the restroom and had to walk through the female waitresses that were cleaning the silverware prior to starting their shift. All they did was talk crap about some girl who was working there and their manager. 

This place has the potential to be something amazing. However, the confusion of which place is which and the rude bartender\/waitress prior to dinner service makes it a failure.I simply love this place mainly for the clam chowder it is so delectably awesome
 I found it on a stay here in South Point when I would stay at the hotel ......but now I come to town just to get the chowder
I get to New England \/ white chowder it is creamy smooth melt-in-your-mouth flavor also the clams are not tough they are so tender you don't even have to chew them they are so good on top of that it is well seasoned nothing really overpowers the combination that the chef put in the ingredients to make this what I call dream chowder
I had a chance to talk to the chef and I asked him how does he do it and he said its a family recipe his name is Jose....... And he said he makes 200 pounds every two days and they sell out faster than he can make the next batch 
I hope they never fire him because a chowder will never be the same...... I've been coming back for 5 years now and it is the best!
Best tip I can give you is sit back enjoy savor the flavor and relax.... Take your time and enjoy every delectable spoonfulI came here awhile ago but it's still my favourite hot pot place so far.  I love the selection of food, quality and sauce bar.  However, if only they could speak English\/Cantonese or not skip over our table when they know that we don't speak mandarin, that would help.  

Food: 
Great broth selection.  They all come at a different price but it's broth quality is good.  Although I didn't have the spicy broths, my friends who did were very impressed with it.  

Food selection and quality is above average.  Food quality is fresh and they have some unique items that other hot pot places usually don't have.  My favourite were the pork neck, hong kong style sausage, dumplings and kelp.  

The sauce bar has around 13 different types of  sauce for you to mix and match to your desire.  It would be nice if they had some pointers for some suggested combos for people who didn't know much about the sauces.  

Atmosphere\/Service:
It was a bit hard to get someone to come serve us.  Although seating is comfortable with tables being spaced apart decently.Tasty Italian food and great formal restaurant for a business lunch or date night. 
Chef was nice to accommodate my low carb request and I enjoyed the seafood linguini but switched pasta out and in were vegetables. Service was great as well!Sat in the bar. I had the Shrimp Po' Boy and dirty orzo. I was a fan of the Po' Boy; crispy shrimp with a nice pickle to balance. The orzo was al dente. My husband loved it. He ordered a bowl of the green pork chile stew for his dinner. Good flavor, but very small portion. He ended up sharing my food. I had a $9 Greyhound with fresh squeezed grapefruit juice. It was good, but again small portion (served in a martini glass) and hard to not finish in one gulp. 
Food was good. The deducted stars are for quantity of food versus price. We left hungry.This place is awesome for a date experience. You get to cook your own food at your own pace, put in whatever veggies and mushrooms you please, and control the spiciness as you desire. The only drawback is they don't have an alcohol license as far as I know, and I like to have sake or beer with my Asian dishes. Still 5 stars though. Will repeat for sure.I have been to the Serendipity's outside of Las Vegas and unfortunately they are all the same..."OK". Great for dessert and EXCELLENT for people watching but unless you want to overpay for actual meals, I would go elsewhere.I chose to visit this location based on the positive reviews and the brunch menu being available until 2pm on Saturday and Sunday.  I had heard you could bring your dogs with you here but until I saw it firsthand and was asked by the hostess how many people and how many dogs I wasn't sure I believed it!  How awesome to bring your pooch with you to a restaurant!!  I recommend this place for anyone looking for a dining option in Downtown Summerlin, dogs or not, this place is epic!

Positives
1) Menu is gigantic!  I don't think there is a way that everyone visiting couldn't find something that they would enjoy on the menu!  We had the "Grizzle Fries" and "Chicken Lettuce Wraps" for appetizers and I recommend both.  I enjoyed the Fried Chicken Sandwich while my wife enjoyed the Black & Bleu burger as main course and both exceeded expectations.  There is also pizza, salads, noodles, along with a variety of meat dishes!  I can't wait to come back and try more of the menu.
2) Brunch menu available until 2pm on Saturday & Sunday.  We didn't have brunch on our most recent visit but look forward to trying the bananas foster French toast, steak & eggs Benedict, breakfast nachos, or breakfast burger!
3) They allow dogs on the outdoor patio and even have a "dog menu" with some basic dog rules: https:\/\/www.lazydogrestaurants.com\/img\/content\/NUTRITION09252017054106.pdf
4) Service is exceptional, I cannot stress enough how important great service is at a restaurant and this place checks that box emphatically!  Well done.

Negatives 
1) Not the fault of the restaurant but this place is popular and wait times could be extensive during peak periods!  Not sure if the take reservations or are on Open Table, may be worth checking out.
2) Parking is adjacent to the mall and was crowded.  I got lucky and found a spot right up front but saw many people walking quite a distance across the parking lot to enter the restaurant.I went with 5 people at lunch time on a Friday. The food was very good. I had a Reuben and a cup of wedding soup and I enjoyed both very much. Others in my party had sandwiches, salads and chili and everyone was very happy with their food. Their main salads are HUGE so beware. 
The only issues was that it took a while to get our food and sadly, we were almost the only people in the restaurant. 
I will definitely go back when I am sure I have some time to spare. 
Very good food!I went out last night for my sister in laws birthday for a good time and we had a GREAT time. We had reservations but waited for longer than I would have liked. The waiting area is hot and over crowded. We ordered sushi and appetizers which were delivered quickly. My drinks were always filled and my waitress was great. The cook that performed was hilarious and very entertaining. He made the whole experience very fun. It was a little louder than I would have liked. We also had a free birthday treat that was delicious! Thanks for the good service and great time!I wish there were more indoor seating. It's like a less awesome Casey Moore's with older people.Not bad for thai food in Phoenix.
granted I only ate 2 items so far, the Papaya salad and Phad Thai.
will try for more items there.Our new favorite pizza in Mesa. We had a half #15, half #19 on thin crust. Delicious. The crust is perfectly chewy, yet slightly crusty on bottom. They put just the right amount of toppings, not too overloaded. 

We called it in and got it to go on a Friday night, but the place was packed inside. I can't wait to go back.Excellent from start to finish. We were seated at 7:15 and had a window seat

She started with a crab appetizer that was excellent. I had the house salad.  For entrees we could not pass up the filet mignon with foie gras.  Unbelievably delicate, medium rare, absolutely fabulous.

Our waiter was excellent, I think his name was Tom.  Perfect in every wayI noticed this new Thai place so i was excited to try it out for dinner tonight.
I placed an order around 8pm for pick up on the way home from work and the guy that took the order on the phone said pickup orders were taking about 25 minutes.  I showed up at 8:30pm and sat at the bar waiting. He did not let me know it was going to take  longer than he thought or offer me a beverage in the beginning.  Only after i had been sitting and waiting for an additional 25 minutes he offered me ice water.  

My order finally came out and I was out the door at 9:05pm and super hungry. I got home and no napkins, no plastic utensils, no to go menu in the bag.
I had ordered both dishes 3 out of 5 spicy and the owner on the phone told me that their place was one level spicier than other Thai places.  Well guess what?  it's not and the pineapple fried rice i ordered had no spices whatsoever on it.  It was completely bland.  I called the restaurant to tell him that they messed up the order and didn't' put in any spices whatsoever. The guy replied "i don't know what to tell you, you should have taken some hot sauce".  Excuse me??? you are going to blame your screw up on me?  He did not apologize or even give me an excuse that they were so busy or say well i hope you will try us again or anything like that.   He just hung up on me.  Are you kidding?  This is not good service.  OK newsflash...the food here isn't even that great to make up for the awful service.   

Because of my work schedule I tend to eat out pretty often so i work long hours and work too hard for my money to be treated like crap by a restaurant.So many type of food to choose from! I liked this place, it's new right on the northeast side of Vegas (Stewart & Nellis) located right next to CiCis pizza, well I loved the concept of having a hibachi hot kitchen area where you pick your ingredients and have someone cook it for you within minutes so Japanese! and their sushi made fresh right before your eyes also very delish. Like any other Asian buffet I chose this one because of their prompt and friendly customer service. This place keeps up with their cleanliness and food is never low. Taking in consideration that all over the northeast side of Vegas (Nellis blvd) has a variety of Asian buffets. Did I also mentioned that this place is huge! It's spacious and there's not a huge wait time to be seated at most you will be looking at 5-10 mins.  Don't forget to check out the koi fish! :)One word, okay three... CHICKEN POT PIE! This dish is embarrassingly big, so big while sitting outside a passerby looked at me strangely and mouthed "what is that? The huge flaky pastry puff that covers the top is amazing plus once you break through the top what awaits you underneath is so amazing. I am not even sure how to describe it, it is just so good and a perfect Vegas hangover cure. What I really loved about it was that it was made with a tomato base vs cream. I am not usually a fan of pot pie for that reason. It made the pie seem a little lighter so you could indulge more in the yummy topping. The service was great, and if you can ask to sit outside so you can people watch. I can't wait to get back to Vegas just so I can visit again.I was promptly and warmly greeted.  I ordered the Wich Came First.  The spices complimented the meal without over powering it.  The chicken was juicy and the egg was perfectly prepared.  As a customer traveling with a Service Dog, I also recommend this restaurant because of the friendly service Izzy received as well.  I highly recommend Scramble for anyone looking for a quick, convenient, delicious meal at a fair price!I swore I wouldn't have sushi in Vegas (easy enough to get at home).  What did I do?  I had sushi in Vegas after having far too many drinks earlier in the day.

The ambiance of the place is awesome.  It's a large space but the lighting made it feel small and intimate.  For such a modern design there was a lot of wood and traditional Japanese elements.  My boyfriend and I decided to sit at the sushi bar.  

Edamame came quickly and was cooked just right (just a little crunchy with a touch of salt).  I decided to eat the tamago (sweet egg), since my stomach was full of booze.  I was surprised to find my order looked like a tamago sandwich, with the rice between two layers of egg.  The soy sauce, which was actually tamari (2 year old soy sauce), was some of the most flavorful soy sauce I had.  I barely needed a few drops to complement my tamago.

Next time I'm at the Cosmopolitan, I'm going to Blue Ribbon Sushi on an empty stomach.What a BLAST.  This was my second time there and it was just as much fun.  You don't have to be a golfer to enjoy this experience.  Service is excellent food and drink were well above average and the golf games are a lot of fun.  Will be back many, many more timesThe best Red Velvet pancakes ever,they are fluffy  and delicious.Omelette was cooked perfectly with lots of flavor served with a side of pancakes.Our server was polite and professional and had  a good knowledge of the menu.Pricing is excellent. Definitely will be back.Spicy, spicy, spicy. 

We came here on a Weekend afternoon and there was barely anybody there. Odd, but I assumed that there's so many 100s of other choices around the area. But am I glad I came here!

The servers were really nice and hospitable, explaining things on the menu. I ordered a Dragon Berry Mojito to start with Deep Fried Tofu. 

I always scarfed down the fried tofu only to have my taste buds burnt. But this time I managed to split my tofu triangle in half and drizzle on the delicious sweet and sour sauce and WAIT for it to cool down a bit. 

We also ordered Chicken Pad Thai, Shrimp Chili Fried Rice and Gulf of Thai Special which consisted of a good amount of seafood selection and a wonderful sauce. 

All spicy levels ordered at an 8, so be forewarned that by spicy, they mean spicy!Reliably tasty with fast, friendly service.Great pub food and WI brew beer list which changed frequently. It's in a neighborhood and has limited parking, but has a great local bar atmosphere.  Went with 3 coworkers and we all loved our sandwiches and burgers. Our server was very attentive and helpful. Will definitely be back!Love this spot great drinx! Great wings! TV's  everywhere, clean, friendly staff! Coming back for sure :-PI am not a big fan of pasta but whenever we go to vegas, we always make it to eat their baked zitti. It's really yummy, creamy and a little sweet, also portions are really big. We only order 1 but it fills me and my wife and even our child. Must try when you are in Vegas, they are usually found in most food courts in hotels.This has to be one of the best Mexican food restaurants in the valley. I will now go out of my way to visit this place every chance I get. This is tradition real Mexican food, not the Americanized versions you get in most place. Bring your appetite because the portions are big.Got some takeout from here on a Tuesday night. Ordered two boxes. One was grilled chicken and the other chicken shawarma. They only provided the white sauce for one meal and not both, got home before I realized, so wasn't too happy about that, but for the most part everything was delicious and service was ok.Kent the owner reached out- i hate writing anything negative on the internet and wouldn't have done it had i not been starving and left waiting for food. That said, everyone makes mistakes- I appreciate the owner reaching out and letting me know my voice was heard- I am still a Rachel's Customer and now a big Rachel's fan!Ramen comes out quickly and delicious. Noodles, meat, and the soup broth are mixed together to create harmony in the form of Sansotei's ramen dishes.

This place is usually crowded and is very tight. 

Service is great and facilities are spectacularly clean.It's a cool, hip, and very tasty ramen place. They play some really funky music and the ambience is stylish. Ramen is top notch. We got there around 12am and got seated right away. Overall, it's a great ramen place that I would definitely come back if I crave ramen again next time I'm in Vegas.Okay food. Okay selection. Awful attitudes from the waitresses, almost as if we were an inconvenience. May go there again.OMG is an upscale HK restaurant with plenty of western dish choices.  The quality of food is good, each dish was well made and presented well. I got the curry shrimp which was appropriately spicy with a good kick and crisp jumbo shrimps. It was delicious without being too overpowering. 

My group loved their individual dishes. The salted pork foot was a delightful surprise, the whole table enjoyed the crispy skin and the tender meat. The meat was a little too salty for my taste but the whole dish got licked clean so I assume it was good. For those who don't like such strong flavors, the smoked salmon pasta seemed like a good choice.First the delivery was amazing. 20 minutes to my door.  Piping hot. Wings were meaty and tasty. Ranch and cheese dipping sauces were prepackaged and ok. Dry rub wings were very juicy.Having been here several times before, I can say the food is great, slightly over priced. However our last experience was awful. We were told the wait time was going to be an hour long, so we opted to sit at the bar (open seating). We found an open table, but it had not been bussed yet so we stood and waited 10 minutes before someone came over to bus the table. Sat there for another 10-15 minutes and waited for the waitress to come take our order. By that time we had already decided that on what we wanted to order. Waitress finally came up and asked us what we would like to drink, placed our drink order and as I'm still talking, informing her that we already know what we want, she just walks off. We waited another 10 minutes for our drinks and placed our order. 30 minutes later we were still waiting for our appetizer and just decided to leave. Upon informing them that we were leaving, they did offer us to speak to a manager.....but by that time, clearly seeing a pattern, we surmised we'd be waiting again to speak to a manager. So we just left. Food is good, they need better service.Sichuan is an institution of chinatown-Spadina. Their lunch menu is reasonably priced ($7 or $7.50 after including tax and tip), and includes soup, a main dish, rice, and tea. Service is good. Decor and music are terrible.

Two things to note here:

1. The majority of the patrons are chinese, not dabizi like me. This is not as 'westernized' as a lot of mainland chinese food in chinatown

2. It's a great place for large groups. Even with a party of 10, you'll probably be seated immediately at a table with a lazy susan. 

3. It's easy to miss. Look up -- the red sign is huge. The storefront is tiny, even though there's lots of room inside.Inept, rude staff who don't seem to care about anything. It took at least five to seven minuets for someone behind the bar to even acknowledge me or offer me a menu. Another Five minuets later it gets worse. Save yourself the trouble and do not go! The restroomes where filthy as well. This list could go on.For all Spring Training Visitors... Morning Squeeze just plain sucks.Hosu is a mix of Japanese and Korean food. It's a bit of a chain with a few locations, they do delivery and they sure can process a ton of people through the lunch hour. When I used to work across the street, I liked that I got a 10% discount with my employee card and that they could take and make an order in ten minutes. What's not so good? The sushi cuts are not the cleanest in the city, so the sashimi sometimes tastes mildly fishy, it's best to stick to bento boxes, maki and their noodle and soup dishes. It leans more towards Korean than anything else, so if you like meat, this is a quick, easy way to grab some Korean BBQ for lunch. They have a small patio out front that turns over quickly if you'd prefer to people watch in the summer as well.Great place to stop for a beer in Vegas. They have about 20 beers on tap and 200 beers in bottles. Their list is so extensive, they use an iPad for their menu. They have preset flights of beer organized by types of beer like hoppy, dark, variety, etc. I decided to go with the hops flight and I was not disappointed. We didn't get to try any of their food because we were saving ourselves for a buffet but I would definitely come back to grab another beer. Of all the places I went to in Vegas they definitely had the best beer selection. I'm not sure what their hours are but it took us three attempts to finally try this place (our fault for not checking the hours), so my best advice would be to go early.Tasty food. 

But.. bit pricy for the portion. 

The cheese rice cake was so tasty.
And spicy seafood soup was good, too.

The staff is polite and nice.

This place is tiny so we got a small table which is uncomfortable to enjoy our food.

Anyways, this is a nice little place. 
Good Korean fusion food with great atmosphere.My favorite restaurant in the world. I recommend the Monica Roll and the Shrimp Yakisoba. Also the service is so good- friendliest people you will meet.Dined here last week for girls night out - we've been here a few times now and food has always been good, but tonight's service was awesome! Our server Ginny Q. was awesome, she's very social and provided great service. Make sure you ask for her. Our group will be back :)Came by to try the crepes as per another Yelper's recommendation. I was amazed at the chocolate fountain when I arrived.

I ordered the Chicken Crepe, but I had the opportunity to try the salmon as well. The chicken was slightly dry, but the salmon was super fresh and on point! I had the opportunity to watch the workers make the crepes in front of me.Meh.  It's cheap pizza, and I guess it's better than Little Caesars.  There's nothing outstanding about the quality, but it's not terrible.  If you need cheep eats, though, it's good enough.Love the view. Food was good too. Taking the free boat ride after brunch! We'll definitely come back. Maybe for the brewgaTheir food made me and my brother sick... don't recommend it unless you want to risk it..Went to this place last night, (June 18\/2017) would not be returning. Service was horrible had to ask for things multiple times, got things we didn't order and didn't get things we did order. The floor and walls were covered in grease and my shoes stick to the floor. The bathrooms were disgusting men's and women's pee on the floor, toilets, garbage on the floor. Will never go back!Food was absolutely delicious. Especially the bone in filet, full of flavors. Foie gras was really tender, the aroma spread in my mouth as soon as I took a bite of it.  Service was exceptional, forgot the server name but he touched our table so many times to make sure we have a good time. Will be back for sure.DOES NOT DESERVE BUSINESS!

The food was for ok, but nothing special considering the prices. My real issue is the refusal by the establishment to make any substitutions for ingredients. I could understand if the restaurant was too bus, but there was only a single other table seated when I was ordering. I asked why they were unable to substitution ingredients and I was told that "the owner creates complete designed meals" and "customer requests would hinder the experience." All I know is that if I am paying for a meal I should be able to get them to hold an ingredient. This pretentious attitude should have no place in the customer experience and the owner should be embarrassed to have her staff tell people such nonsense. This tone is disrespect to her paying customers and the community.I had some high hopes for the newly re-branded restaurant taking place of long-time Scarborough staple, Dragon Dynasty.  We came very early on a Saturday morning to celebrate my aunt's birthday (note it was about 1 week into Chinese New Year). My aunt came at 9am to claim a table early for the 12 of us.  

Food: they did offer some more unique dim sum dishes aside from the traditional but I have to say nothing was particularly delicious or flavourful. Rather everything just fell below average in my opinion.  I tried everything we ordered but nothing stood out, I didn't go for seconds when there were leftovers, every was just meh. Good quality but meh in terms of flavour.

The restaurant itself is bright, airy. The old chairs have covers not which are weirdly foamy. The staff seem to be very overwhelmed as it was hard to get service (tea refills, plates taken away, etc) staff was nice though for the most part.  

For the morning special we had more than enough food for 12 people, (with lots of leftovers) total was about $120 which was inexpensive but in the densely competitive market that is dim sum in the GTA-East- Grandeur lands just short of making it on the return list.Had dinner with three friends here and it was an excellent experience.  The food was very good quality and the service was delightful.  I would highly recommend it.I wish I could rate it better, and almost rated it worse - as I tend to lean towards Jack in the Box for fast food more than other places. This is close to my home. I have lived in the neighborhood for 8 yrs - they have always done well. I have noticed this past year or so that they would constantly be out of cherries for the shakes or whip cream all the time! I "many" times leave the drive through to grab a fry or two and a majority of the time they are luke warm. One time they were less than that. Really ticks me off! Their burgers are always fresh and good. Yesterday I went and noticed they had a whole menu change and got rid of my favorite burger. So I order a shake (sorry we are all out of shakes) - are you kidding me!!!! First it was the cherries and whip cream, now it's the shakes too! If I didn't know better this place may be closing down. Ok, then I ordered a Bacon\/Swiss burger for $6.99. The guy asks if I want bacon on that. LMAO! I said well it says Bacon\/Swiss and he says I know but it is $ .25 for bacon! I said that is not what the menu says - I will go elsewhere, so I left. I love Jack in the Box. But this is ridiculous!!!!!Erin was an awesome server. She helped my husband pick his new favorite meal. We love eating here. My daughter had a waffleThey picked up on my ABC (American Born Chinese) accent right away!  That and the "QQ"ness of the boba speak to the authenticity of this place!  Bustling little place located in what I like to think of as the "chinatown of pittsburgh".

Veer away from the smoothie drinks--my "strawberry smoothie" boba was a hot pink color that was nowhere near natural.  You judge a boba place by its plain milk tea anyways and it was thumbs up in my opinion.  Ask for the BIG BOBA or else they give you the little ones and then your big straw is just useless.

Some favorites:  home style tofu, sweet and sour pork chop, my favorite veggie dish "si gua" with scallops.  Everything we've had from here has been yummy and I already know what I want next.  Next time--beef noodle soup, you are mine!Everything tasted fresh and well seasoned. Service is friendly too. Definitely worth going back for more!This steak house is the secret gem of Las Vegas.  The food and service is top notch. It's slightly off the strip so parking is much easier. You get the experience of a high end strip steakhouse without all the hassle. The decor is old school classy and the food is sassy the perfect combination!Feb 2016 - Quick, affordable pick up for lunch:

http:\/\/congee-wong.com\/food\/Ehhhh so so. Pretty bland for mexican food. Not impressed. Service and ambience were good, however.This is a great place to go just for people watching if nothing else. When we were seated we were put between a table from the cast of Jersey Shore and My Super Sweet 16, good god. That aside, I wasn't sure if I was in a night club or a restaurant. Music was fairly loud but it wasn't a problem. The food was good and the service was good as well. Introduced my wife to Sake for the first time too. Uh, she's NOT a fan (of Sake anyway).Very casual place tucked in the back of a shopping strip mall. Very reasonable prices for everything. Wanted a quick bite so only ordered the small garlic cheese pizza. 7$Markham Station is a throwback to the good old days when you could get a plate of artery clogging goodness for less than $10. Surprisingly, not much has changed here. If you get in early enough, you get their $5.99 deal which includes 3 eggs, bacon, and potato's, along with anything else they have in their kitchen thrown in for good measure.

Apart from the usual breakfast foods of eggs, pancakes, french toast and omelettes, there's also a good number of more 'lunch driven' options like burgers and sandwiches. The club sandwich is particularly good. It's big, well put together and even comes with a pickle (yay).

If you're in the mood for a traditional breakfast and looking for a Cora's alternative, then I would give this place a try. Just get ready to waddle home with a belly full of satisfaction.What I love about Port of Subs is the consistency in the sandwiches at all locations.  I tend to treat this location as my kitchen since when I'm too busy to buy groceries or generally lazy I just stop in for breakfast for lunch.  I do love the freshly sliced meats and ingredients along with great service.  I know this location gets busy but they always remember my order and even speed through the grillers I order on a regular basis.  If you're looking for a sandwich place with friendly service, made to order, and plenty of options this is the place.This place lets you select fresh seafood (e.g. mostly fish) at the glass counter, cooking style, and sides. The cooking styles are Egyptian \/ Middle Eastern, and sides come with hummus and babbaganoush - which I absolutely love.

I ordered the Singari-style grilled sea bream, which was nicely grilled with the perfect amount of seasonings. It went really well with the seasoned rice, salad, pita, hummus, and babbaganoush. Very delectable meal in casual setting.Have only had breakfast here but it's always been terrific. Food is excellent, large portions and outstanding service.So, this restaurant sits next door to the business that literally says "European Hoes" on the front.  Yeah, Thirteen North's location is shall we say, a bit quirky.  In some ways its a wonder people can even find this place.  Set in a row of tiny businesses, each with signage begging for attention from those en route to or away from the 51 freeway, Thirteen North doesn't stand out in opulence or even its menu really.  But it suits the neighborhood well as a friendly hangout with a friendly staff and a super laid back atmosphere.  My Dad wanted to grab dinner and loved their burgers so I joined him here on a Thursday after work.

Despite its appearance as a small hole in the wall on the outside, the interior restaurant is surprisingly spacious with room for probably 50 or so inside and another dozen or so outside.  It was a light crowd tonight so my Dad and I go to it right away.  While my Dad raved about the burgers, one menu item caught my attention.  I haven't had Walleye fish since I lived in Minnesota over 11 years ago.  It was genuinely shocking to see that on a menu in Phoenix.  So what the hell, let's see if its as good as I remembered.  

The Walleye came with a beef and veggie soup to start and the fish itself was accompanied by steam veggies and mashed potatoes.  The beef and veggie soup was pretty tasty and came with some nicely charred bread with butter and garlic.  A nice start.  When the main dish came out I was pretty impressed by the size of the fish.  I've seen some pretty big walleye back in Minnesota, but this was huge.  The fish was light and flaky just as I remember and the lemon butter sauce was a nice unobtrusive accompaniment.  For dessert I went with the brownie with ice cream.  This was a disappointment.  For starters, the amount of whipped cream on this was way over the top.  The intent of using a whole can of whipped cream was clearly to make the dessert look gargantuan, but it just looked silly.  The ice cream was fine, but the brownie itself was airy and bland.  I prefer a more hearty brownie with plenty of chocolate flavor (or even chocolate chunks for bonus points).

Aside from the dessert snafu, my first experience here was a pretty positive one.  Total price for all my food and a glass of water plus tax and tip came to about $28.  As mentioned earlier, the staff was incredibly friendly and my Dad and I felt completely relaxed here.  Would certainly come back to try more of the rest of the menu.  Maybe I'll pick up a European Hoe while I'm at it (kidding, probably).All I ordered was onion rings.  What I got was barely heated frozen cardboard.  I asked for the check - waiter did not ask what was wrong, disappeared.  Paid check with cash, walked out.Was relatively late at night (after 8pm) on a Wednesday for dinner and we wanted something relatively close by and good but not fast food. We looked on Yelp and saw this place had high ratings, was close, and was cheap so we went to check it out

The food was darn good and I fully intend on coming back here. Do not let the way the little strip mall looks deter you. We thought it looked sort of grimy from the outside but the establishment was clean and nice as you could want. It was a tad on the warm side and they didn't have a proper air conditioner just a fan so you may wanna watch out when coming here on humid days and dress lightly.I get the red curry with tofu every god damn time I'm there and it's excellent, so my review is based on that. The other stuff must be good too but I'm a weirdo and don't want to risk it!We decided to celebrate another anniversary at Maggianos this year and I am so glad we did. We have a reservation at 6pm and were seated in less than 5 minutes.

We started with the mozzarella marinara which was nice thick slices of cheese breaded and fried and served topped with marinara and more cheese. I mean how could that be wrong? 

I chose to get the Rustic Chicken and Shrimp minus the shrimp that I have ordered before but SO enjoy! It was very good with lots of chicken, mounds of pasta and a creamy sauce that kind of make you want to forget your table manners and slurp it up. 

Hubby chose the center cut filet mignon. At $39, you would expect exactly what he got. Steak so tender it almost needed no knife and flavored crust that was perfct...even if a bit salty for my preference.

We chose the tiramisu as our dessert and it arrived with candles in honor of our anniversary!  It was rich, flavorful and absolutely delish! Our waiter put a couple of chocolate chip cannolis on the side as a extra anniversary treat and they were delicious too!

Speaking of waiter, we were lucky to have Dink who was helpful, funny and attentive. He was happy to offer suggestions when asked and make small talk without being obtrusive. 

All in all a great visit!Randomly came here with the family. The place is what you expect it to be, a typical viet\/Chinese restaurant. They do serve authentic Vietnamese food, and the prices are actually good for the quality\/portion you get. We had ordered the Portuguese chicken with spaghetti, highly recommend. Tasty and enough for three people really. Service was great too, they gave us enough lemons and sauces (we just love to have excess). Most likely will come back here, for a cheap lunch on a weekend!!The best take-out or dine in Chinese restaurant at a really great price! 
The lunch and dinner specials are well varied without being too restrictive in options, like some other places in town.Best Mexican food I've had in a long time. Good atmosphere.This place has really good Phillies cheese sandwiches.  It's a meaty cheesy goey goodness and if you like meat and cheese then this place is for you.  Meat was good quality.  I put onions and jalapeños but they had many different versions.  The fries were a dollar, dollar Friday fries and hey were fried with nice batter and a lot of seasoning.   They were really good. It's easy to miss this place and I passed it but I yelped first and I knew my yelp community wouldn't let me down. If a place like this has 41\/2 stars with over 200 reviews they are doing something right.  I am rooting for this place.  I would totally come back and I recommend this place.  Oh yeah they gave me a free ice water and it was yummy.  Mango was bomb.As a disclaimer:  I never, ever, ever write reviews.  However, this place gave me the inclination  to make a Yelp account so I could do so. 

My boyfriend and I were in Pittsburgh just for fun, as we live a few hours away and just wanted to explore.   I looked at restaurants that would give us a nice view of Pittsburgh, and this place came up.  I believe when I made the reservation it said to ask for a view when I got there.

But I didn't need to. The hostess took us to a corner table with an incredible view of the city.  It was then I knew this dinner was going to kick ass.  The smell of seafood on the way to our table was more intoxicating than we had planned on getting that evening.  We started off with a succulent bottle of Amarone.  Most of their wine list are wines from the U.S., but I personally like to get down with the Italians.  Our appetizers were oysters on the half shell and seared Kobe; which the only complaint that I have is that they didn't just keep bringing to the table until we told them to stop.  Then we split the crab soup, which my boyfriend and I harassed our server about getting us the recipe because it was- The. Best. Soup. Ever.  For our entrees he had rockfish prepared the Thai peanut way and I had Caribbean Sea Bass. Both of us took the first bite and our legs went numb.  It was that weird erotic satisfaction only perfectly prepared delicious food can give you - that almost sexual satisfaction where nothing in the world matters except for the next bite, which you are almost afraid to have because you don't want the food to go away.  Both of us were fat and happy by the end of this, but we couldn't stop there. Dessert?  When in Rome... Or something.  Why can't they have a sampler of all of the desserts?  Sighhhhhh... Oh well.  We decided on sharing the Banana Foster cheesecake. Holy Moses was it delicious.  It made you forget about all the other food you just stuffed in your belly and focus on the magical piece of cheesecake in front of you. Neither of us could remember a more satisfying meal.  Maybe we both have the same taste in food, but it ruined the rest of our night because although the night had just begun, nothing was going to top this meal.

As for the service, I believe our server's name was Jane.  She was incredibly appropriate and wonderful.  She was knowledgeable not just about the menu, but about Pittsburgh itself, and really just was perfectly pleasant in every way. The entire staff seemed happy and like they wanted to be there.  

Thanks Monterey Bay!Deep fried pockets of deliciousness.... Even better when served with green chile pork, chorizo, or as the Ultimate taco.  It gets crowded around lunchtime, so take out is a good option.Lets start with the good

1. Cheap 5buck lunch meal
2. Clean dining area

Now to the bad

1. Rude counter employees
2. women cooking food with long hair and no hair nets
3. Dirty Bathrooms that had urine smell and stains on toilets
4. Under staffed at lunch time, makes for long wait for serviceThey are open in the new location at 7000 Mayo. Scottsdale and the 101. I've been coming here since I was a little kid in the early 80s and I still love their #13!! yummy!!I've been coming to Phoenix several times a year for the past five years.  I have heard about Pizzeria Bianco incessently during that time but haven't been able to eat there because I am not willing to wait 2 + hours for pizza, no matter how good it is, unless my waitress is a bikini clad Mila Kunis (and maybe not even then).  However, when I learned they had opened another restaurant right around the corner from the office, I was there at 11:15 am the next day and was able to be seated immediately.

My review is pretty simple: this place totally lives up to the ridiculous hype.  The pizza (Sonny Boy) was amazing, as was the Market Salad (this one had arugula, peaches, walnuts, goat cheese).  Dying to come back and try everything else on the menu.My husband and I lovingly refer to Phoenix Ranch Market as Food City on Crack!  This place is amazing, but be prepared for a bit of culture shock as this is a truly authentic Mexican grocery store.  I have only walked the perimeter of the store, which is the bakery, fish market and carneceria. 

The bakery is phenomenal,  I would especially recommend the dulce de leche cake.  Next stop fish market, with an excellent seafood spread.  You can order food-to-go straight from the market, I recommend the shrimp ceviche.  Next stop the meat market - Wow!  Some interesting food you would not find at your local Albertson's.  Carne Asada (marinated) is an excellent and cheap choice to take home and have a mexican bbq in your very own backyard.  

The restaurant next door is also very good - great seafood enchiladas.  There are also soom little shops with items you would expect to find at a border town shop.I must agree with other Yelpers that the staff here was not friendly whatsoever. I had never been to a Pita Pit before and I will not go back. You'd be better to take your money to an actual Mediterranean restaurant (fast food or not) and have fresher food with some flavor. I ordered the falafel and souvlaki pita of the month. First of all, they have all the meats underneath the grill in a big drawer. Everything was processed and of poor quality. My pita had maybe 3 little pieces of chicken and it was the kind of slimy chicken you get on the BK Broiler at Burger King. Disgusting. The falafel tasted like mush. The rest of the toppings were just ordinary wilted looking vegetables. 

Probably the worst part of the experience here was that while I was choosing what toppings I wanted in my pita I asked for hummus and was told "that costs $1 extra". I don't mind paying extra, but I was not going to get my credit card back out and go back to the counter behind a line of other guests to pay $1 for a tablespoon of hummus on my pita. The best part about it was the man in front of me asked for hummus and was given it for no extra charge by the other staff member.  So get it straight, is hummus $1.00 or not? And let us know upfront what costs extra because the cash register is at the beginning of the line!Absolutely delicious and amazing service! We will most definitely be back and look forward to exploring the menu more. We had the shrimp lover and citea both very good and we had the tuna and salmon sashimi as well with tip $34 which is a great deal for a fantastic meal and exceptional service.This place is a great value for what you get or a "good bang for your buck". They're very decent about if you want to change your broth from spicy to mild. Only 2.50 charge which is a great deal. You have all you can eat meat and items for your pot which gets extra points in my book!Update. I'm taking back the nice things I said about the front desk staff. I should have waited to write my review until I checked out.
Update (again):  I received a call from the housekeeping manager yesterday and he was very apologetic and assured me this was an aberration. He also gave me his contact information and asked for the opportunity to make it right by offering us a free night when we are again in the area. We likely won't, but it was a nice offer.This is a nice smaller restaurant but the food packs a punch. We love Thai food, heard about this place and decided to give it a try. I had the pad Thai because I feel it is the best is the best way to measure a Thai restaurant and it was fairly wonderful. You get multiple options for heat (mild, medium, hot, very hot and Thai hot). Heat level is often subjective so I opted for 'very hot' with it being my first visit.  The noodles were cooked perfectly, the portion size was filling and, yes, "very hot" is an 8 out of 10 (assuming Thai hot is 10 of 10") but not overwhelming. 

My wife had the yellow curry and deemed it "fantastic." She is a big fan of curry and has tried it all over this country and the world.  

The staff were very nice and gracious. 

This is a new neighborhood gem for us.This place was one of the worst Filipino establishment I've been to. Been here twice and the servers\/ food attendants were always rude. They just always chit chat loudly and gossips about other people. Makes me feel uncomfortable while eating my food. First time I ate in here was with a friend who is visiting and commented about the same thing, that the employees were rude. Second time I came here was just me alone, ordered the longganisa which was a bit sour and definitely not for me. The cashier was kinda rude too, I paid cash and she shook the tip box right in front of me like she was purposely asking for a tip. That was just uncalled for.Thought me and the fam would try out a new place for family dinner, and the reviews of this place drew me to it. I loved it, the atmosphere and food were wonderful. I wish I would've known the lunch menu has more sandwiches, because that's what I was in the mood for but the dinner menu was good as well! 

The waitress was very nice and informative, had a pleasant experience! Will be back!Insanely over-priced.  The frozen hot chocolate doesn't live up to the hype.  (If you want to make it at home, just make yourself some hot chocolate, freeze it, then eat it as it's thawing.)  Portion size of the appetizers and side dishes is a rip-off.

We ordered:

Frozen Hot Chocolate (for 2) - nothing special
Chicken Tenders - it was okay, but barely serves one person.
Deep Fried Oreo Sundae - too rich and heavy
Sweet Potato Fries - very good, but chintzy in size

As far as ambiance is concerned, this place looked so tacky.  It was as if Atlantic City came and threw up all over the outside of Caesar's Palace.

No one needs to try this place.  Vegas has way better food establishments that are actually worth your time, money, and taste buds.I'd like to go straight to the point and say, if you're a group and you're planning to visit the new PNPK... Don't! Now, let me explain. Go, but only if there's one person paying for the entire bill, but avoid if you're seeking for the usual convenience of the split system, because here they won't. What a massive headache and dissapointment it was to get out of this place after 12 of us ate here one Sunday... And the place was not even crowded!! I do not recommended that to absolutely anyone else. I don't recommend the wait for the meal either. One of the members of our party got his soda... No lying.... Nearly one hour later. He re ordered and they forgot again. It was a terrible dissapointment. This place is still very rookie, and it needs a lot of work. The 3 stars are for Krystal. She made up a drink exclusively for me. I didn't know what cocktail to order so, she went to task and brought it home. It was some kind of Mojito, with Strawberries and some kind of liquour. Don't ask me but you can stop by and ask for the Krystal Tea... That's how we named it. Hey, something this good deserved a name. Which by the way the 'Tea' is after my name. Pretty creative, eh? Or should I say, 'Kryst-ative'? Anyway, that's it. Give it a try if you can.This review is on the thick Italian sipping chocolate.  I have never eaten here however I have been here many times in the winter months for the sipping chocolate (please DO NOT mistake for hot chocolate) After my boyfriend being to Spain he told me about this kind of drink this is not quite the same but as close as he has found here in the US.  If you're wondering what it's like in Spain it is like a chocolate bar melted with a crispy sweet bread if you put it in it would stand on end.  This is ever so slightly more liquid but OMG good!  Pretty much a milk chocolate, if that is you choice bar melted down with milk added and put in a cup warm.

You don't need much at all.  The way it used to work was they had a little kioskey thing out front to just order and go.  They must have wanted to up the value of the property so that is now gone for tables for dinner.  You now have to go into the bar and order, this wouldn't be a bad thing but the bartenders are truly unpleasant.  I mean if you hate your job that much and you pouring a cup of chocolate into a cup for me and getting a tip for your unpleasantries and inconvenience is such a problem then please find a new job!  I hate the new layout and consider not ever coming back but sadly I like chocolate and I like it a lot in small portions so I will come back.

Again this review is not for food it is for sipping chocolate and sipping chocolate service.  If you do go in get the sipping chocolate not hot chocolate it is a thicker more amazing version if you get hot chocolate it is just that and at this place it is over priced and not that great!  If you go with my recommendation it is a pay per oz kinda thing.  You do NOT need a full 6oz cup please learn from my mistakes of the past 3oz is great sometimes 1oz is fine but just not quite enough.

If it wasn't for the crapy, crabby service this would have been 5 stars for the chocolate  by the way this is not the first time to go into the bar and get crabby service, they really need to retrain and rehire the bar staff...Service is awesome.  Staff is great, ordered tilapia burrito stuff with rice, sweet corn, purple cabbage, omg it was delicious, recommend this to anyone.Best Sushi in town...All you can eat for 20 bucks is the best deal u can ever find..and that includes almost everything in the menu not just sushi.
My record : 48 piece
Can you beat that?I didn't get my free hot fresh glazed sample. People after me did that walked in as I was leaving. No hot fresh free sample might as well go to pink boxPros: 

-- Really good food (bar food)
-- Burgers are delicious 
-- Vegetarian options for those such afflicted
-- Delectable beers (obviously)
-- Dog friendly patio

Cons:

-- Packed on peak hours \/ days
-- Only one dessert option (but it's delicious)

Check this place out. You won't be disappointed. You're welcome.Good for you if you'd like to be sick and miss work. Two people from my party who ordered the same food became ill. Gave them a shot for lunch even after I saw a bad review regarding food quality and food poisoning. Sure enough I've been sick to my stomach for over 48 hours and I'm on medicine. 

Would not give them another chance.Although there was a bit of a wait when I got there (the couple in front of me ordered a lot of food) I really enjoyed the food! I ordered two chicken katsu burgers and a chicken katsu rice and taro chips. I would give the food a 4\/5 but it was really the service that got me giving this place a 5\/5!Came here for my anniversary about a year ago. This place was very nice, however it just didn't give me that oomph. Maybe I'm just hard to impress, but I didn't feel the magic. 
Regardless, I loved the food and service. The place could be more cozy, however it wasn't too bad. 
Escargots were our appetizers, however I didn't find that they popped. Myra they were exotic and french, but I've cooked better myself as I don't exactly cook. 
For our main, both me and my boyfriend got the crepes (I got the goat cheese one!) and it was delish. The crepes are just a mash of everything that tastes good wrapped up elegantly together. If I had to recommend anything about this place, it would be the crepes. 
The service was alright, expected a bit more for such a nice plus + the price Im paying for food. 
The decor is absolutely stunning. It's quite dim, but the olden brick walls and paintings look brilliant. 
Overall, it's a cute place. But cute places could be found all over Toronto while leaving my wallet a bit more full.We went to the opening this weekend and WOW what a cool place!  I loved the unique Cleveland names and labels for the wine, and the Pino Grigio was one of the best I've had. And they have wine slushies!!

There is local art in the walls, comfy areas to sit, and a large bar. It's also fun that you can see into the room where they bottle wine. 

We will definitely be back soon!Steaks are good & service is pretty good.  Nice to have complimentary bread steaks, bread, and app sized candy dessert.

Steaks are NOT worth the price \/ overall meal is not a good value.

Tuna tartar app is too salty however the siracha based sauce and wasabi mixed with mayo are nice.    Sides are also on the smaller size - they say that they serve 2 - yes, 2 young ladies who have chosen to watch what they eat - more like meant for 1 normal steak eating guy.

$350 for party of 2 with 1 alcoholic beverage each, 1 app, 2 steaks for main course, 2 sides and 20% tip.Ate here once and the food was just alright.  Nothing special.  I'd say Toast is the better choice --just a personal opinion.  The staff are very polite and service was fantastic.  

Nice courtyard area to side of store, and plenty of parking.First of all, the customer service here is just RIDICULOUS! I usually go to Sushi Bong a few doors down (a VERY good sushi place, by the way!), but I've been wanting to check this place out since Yelp Reviews say that they have really good tuna kimbap and that I'm missing out if I don't try it. I walked into the restaurant and there was only one young gentleman waiting on tables and doing take-outs. There were only 2 tables that he needed to serve and I get that he needed some time to finish handling all the orders\/giving out food before he can attend to me, whether sit-in or take-out. But, the guy should at least tell me to just wait a minute or have a seat while he's serving others instead of just staring at me and not say anything. It was my first time there and I had no idea if I should wait at the cashier for him or what. If I didn't want to try the 'famous' tuna kimbap, I would have left with that attitude. 

I ordered the Tuna Kimbap to-go. I paid for it and then had to wait 5-10 minutes for it. The problem with this guy again is that he doesn't communicate with the customers. As in, I asked to pay with my credit card and pressed in the numbers in the machine, but he NEVER said that I needed to pay $0.50 more if I paid with credit card. I asked him about it and he said it is because I asked to pay with credit card. There was NO notice saying that customers needed to pay extra if paying with credit card or only allowing credit cards over a minimum amount. He should have at least told me, but he didn't. I should have refunded my order. 

The Tuna Kimbap was way overpriced! At $6.20 (tax included), it was seriously a rip off. I am not sure why other Yelpers think that their kimbap is awesome, but it tasted the same as the ones that I can get at a nearby Korean supermarket. At that price, I would expect a bigger roll with more (fresher) ingredients. There's nothing special about it. 

I think I'll stick to the sushi rolls next door.Great value for great food.  The sandwiches are big and the sides are tasty. Try the pork belly bao. The dining room is always clean and inviting.While the food was great, I did not feel appreciated as a guest at Forequarter. As other Yelpers have noted, "pretentious" is the key word here.

My New Year's Eve reservation was at 5:00 p.m. After walking down two snowpacked blocks from my parking spot -- P.S.: I have no idea where guests are supposed to park -- I had to stand outside of Forequarter in 20-degree weather with strong wind until 5:00 p.m. on the dot because their doors were locked. The Forequarter staff inside surely saw the six of us standing there in the cold; we saw them!

My complaint is not unreasonable; I understand a business having specific hours, and I understand a business taking reservations due to limited space and seating. If Forequarter is so adamant about keeping its doors locked until 5:00 p.m., though, it should not book reservations exactly at 5:00 p.m. as a courtesy to guests so they don't have to stand outside in the cold like nincompoops.

During dinner, three men, presumably the owners, walked into Forequarter. One helped himself to a glass of beer behind the bar. Did not chit-chat with or greet guests. Since they were in\/out of the kitchen and speaking with the staff, they clearly had some higher-up position with the restaurant, yet they gave off a very unprofessional vibe.

Food was quite good. Best dish of the night was the fried brussels sprouts. All the other dishes we tried were cooked well and were quite tasty. 

In the end, Forequarter is a good place to go if you like small plates. It's not a good place to go if you like good service. I prefer Graft on the Square for small plate\/tapas-style style food, though. And Graft also doesn't make me stand out in the cold.I hesitated to go after reading some reviews on Yelp - my husband is from Pittsburgh and wanted to take our family to what he remembered as an elegant and special restaurant. I am so glad we listened to him! The view was amazing. The ambiance is spectacular! Our meal was delicious! The entire staff made us feel special from the moment we arrived. It's not modern and trendy - but it is very good and elegant. We saw a lot of multigenerational tables - easy to see why - what a great tradition!The best coffee is freshly roasted and ground. This is the place to get it, have a cup there or to go. Try taking a pound of coffee home and you'll never go back to grocery store coffee roasted a year ago in another country.I've been back quite a few times for happy hour and I do have to say that I am liking Steel Cactus more and more for that.  I did order soup yesterday and it took almost 5 minutes to get a spoon for it because apparently the waiter didn't actually have access to the soup spoons and had to get one from the kitchen.  It's ok though because it wasn't particularly good (cold or warm) anyway.  Another thing I would like to see is some consistency.  The PIC and I order pretty much the same things when we go there, but each time the dishes are different.  Do the nachos come with black beans or was that a mistake this time?  How do I get a little cup of chopped up jalepenos once and the next time I get whole ones?  Why do I get a different salsa each time?  It's all very confusing.

There is one thing that will make me give this place an extra star - get some darned refried beans on that menu!Great fresh food, very friendly staff, Tommy is great, and the vibe of fantastic.  We were there for a mid afternoon bite.  Only had the roasted vegetables and the spinach salad but they were both great.  Can't wait to come back for a full meal!  Thanks Tommy!I go there often.  I love this place.  The best Szechuan in Montreal.  No doubt.  If you like it spicy, that is the place to go.

The Spicy Boil Fish is really really good.  I also enjoy the Spicy Cucumber Salad.So i got some carry-out today from this local pizza shop. They had a deal going where each large pizza 1-topping was only $5 if you did carry-out. This is a perfect price point and the pizza was enjoyable. For fast, hot pizza at that price I would recommend it!Fabulous meal!  Service was the best we have had in a very long time.  We had salmon & pecan crusted chicken (2 different dishes)....outstanding.  We've lived here 12 years and wish we had known about this cozy, elegant restaurant much sooner.AWSOME !! My wife had the camaron a la diabla we sugest you have the mild it down because the hot truely comes from hell. I had the torta cubana it was GREAT  man vs food size portion too.... Next time in Vegas we will definitely come again.I love it here! Right down the street from my house and it's culture rich. I can dig it. The sweet tea was amazing. I had rib tips and chicken which were both good. I admit the tips were a little dry. But overall still good the ribs however I was definitely impressed with we got half and half rack of ribs and it was super good. Definitely on my bucket list to come back :-)I love how it's a cafe and an Asian restaurant in one. We happen to have a Buy 1 Get 1 Pho FREE. I ordered the pho with no meat (only because it was lent and I was unable to eat meat).  It took some time for the server to bring us our food.

A small pho was pretty big! It was tasty. But if you want the extra condiments, like the hoisin, sriracha, and fish sauce you need to flag down a Asian server because the other servers wouldn't know what those condiments are. 

Overall if you happen to stay at the Palms and crave for some pho. Fortunes is the place to be.NO LONGER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE! Won't be going back and you shouldn't either!!!

 If I can give 0 stars I would! My family and I always go to Rigatonys for the past 6 years since before they moved BUT today marks the last time! Don't bother going! All I have to say is they are very rude. They don't care about their patron like they use to. Service has lowered as well. I'm extremely disappointed.  

Save your money, don't spend it here.Awesome food and a great beer list. It does get busy and there's a wait but that comes with the territory.  The service is always great. The parking can be tricky it's best to get here early before it fills up. I like to park on the street and just walk to all the awesome places in this street.Here lies the remains of my Ling & Louie's review, may it rest in peace.
A once colorful and insightful diatribe, (at least in my opinion) is now rotting somewhere in the depths of a dark and dingy Yelp dungeon. (see below)
I'll give it another try. Here goes.

Ling and Louie's is a nice retreat from all the madness one might expect from an Indian Casino and its trailer-trash, octogenarian patrons. 
Their Evil Jungle Princess is 8.95 and average, nothing to get excited about.

I took sanctuary in Ling & Louie's after I caught drift of what the Summer's Eve challenged old lady on the slot machine next to mine was cooking, my nose hairs singed beyond recognition.

As I said, safe haven for under ten bucks is a deal, even if the food is average.


Hi Diego,

We wanted to let you know that we've removed your review of Ling and Louie's Asian Bar and Grill, Wild Horse Pass. Our Support team has determined that it falls outside our Content Guidelines (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/guidelines) because it contains inappropriate content.The food I had here last night was awesome and worth the 3 stars alone however the bartender was sooooo bad. She would literally disappear for 15 min at a time to the other side of the bar where there were only like 2 patrons. My favorite part was getting up to get my own food from the pass after it was sitting under the heat lamp for at least 5 minutes no exaggeration. The cook was nice though we gave him 15 percent tip and her 5 percent since she basically did nothing definitely need to refine their service here but food is solidHORRIBLE!!! The dishes are absolutely filthy, they are yellow in color however you can see black dirt all over them and some even have pieces of unwashed food on them. All of the table and seats were disgusting and filthy. The bathroom is a complete mess and always stinks of urine. There was fecal matter smeared all over the mirror on our last visit. Yeah I know, It's in an undesirable part of town however this does not condone this. I will be contacting corporate as well as the health district! I have watched this location go from being pretty good when it first opened to being totally disgusting. I would NOT recommend this filthy place to anyone.Before going to a friend's musical performance nearby, we came to this place for dinner. It was the busiest Swiss Chalet I have been to! Lots of people on a weekend evening but that was kinda expected. Place was nicely decorated for Christmas. However I found the lighting a bit too bright and the seating really small if you are sitting in a booth

Service was very friendly. Food came fairly quick after we placed. Overall it was delicious; I did feel the food was prepared in a hurried manner somehow. Chicken and ribs were not bad but roast beef was lukewarm and garlic toast was hard as a rock.

The lady who served us was very sweet and we were in a rush. Therefore we did not bother to address the issues to her. However I was not really impressed with this location. Since there is tons of dining options around, I will probably skip this one next time I am downtown.Comfy porch sitting. Great people watching. Spot on, well seasoned, juicy burger with kickin' fries - Yum!  Worth spending time and ($) for a drink or two...or three.After paying respects to the deceased, it is a tradition that my relatives and I gathered to have lunch at Congee Queen. Our meal consisted of Fried Dough, Fried Sweet Dough, Seafood Congee, Shrimp and Black Fungus Soup Dumplings, Ying Yang Rice, Chow Fun, and Stir Fried Vermicelli Noodles.

You Tiao is a long golden-brown deep-fried strip of dough, commonly served with either soybean milk or congee. Fried Sweet Dough is a golden-brown deep-fried elliptical shaped dough. I liked how the Fried Dough ('You Tiao') and Fried Sweet Dough ('ngau lei sou') were chewy with a soft interior and a crunchy exterior.

The Seafood Congee consisted of boiling hot flavorful rice porridge with surfer clam, shrimp, scallop, salmon, and white fish. 

The Shrimp and Black Fungus Soup Dumplings ('Shui Jiao') consisted of wonton wrapper filled with shrimp and black fungus) cooked in a salty but tasty chicken stock.

The Ying Yang Rice consisted of ying (tomato, egg, and chicken sauce) and yang (shrimp, peas, and egg white sauce) over rice. 

The Chow Fun consisted of hor fun (wide rice noodles) stir fried with beef, onions, bean sprouts, and soy sauce.

The Stir Fried Vermicelli Noodles consisted of vermicelli noodles stir fried with shrimp, eggs, onions, and bell peppers. I highly recommend this noodle dish.Enjoy the atmosphere here and the delicious authentic food. It's quiet and we get excellent service.My 5 star review is based on two things:

Bloody Mary Bar: OUTSTANDING. I was full before I got my meal. Seriously.

The Mini Donuts: Absolutely delicious. We almost ordered a second basket of them.

The rest of our brunch was good, but I would go back just for those two things and be completely satisfied.I'll be honest, I looked to the Yelp reviews for this one. My friend and I were in the sushi mood and wanted a place we had never been before. So I checked Yelp! This place had some great reviews. The people love it and I was sold.

Our server was wonderful! A little strange and he liked to talk a lot but that's not always a bad thing. He was very attentive and made sure our water was always full. We had a hard time choosing what to order, so we got three! The volcano rock was brought to the table first. I wasn't crazy about this one but it had to do with the honey mustard flavored sauce. I hate honey mustard you see, and it had a deep burn in your sinuses. I'm assuming there was some wasabi in it. I love spicy food but this was something completely different. It made me want to tear off my nose and drown it in my water. My friend loved it though, so I know that it was just my taste preferences.

Next we had the Parma roll and the Christmas roll. Both delightful! The Parma roll was a little hard to eat with chop sticks but it was very good. Anything with crab on it, I'm sold. The food was great and for a reasonable price.The best food and the best service in Montreal. I've lived here almost 2 years and no other restaurant can compare. I would recommend this to everyone!The Smoked Pastrami sandwich is tits. Just get it. 

Burgers are OK. 

The Priority Pass deal makes it worth it. $28 in credits is great.Gaucho is always fantastic.  This trip three of us shared the paella.  Paella is served in a 15-inch pan, which was more than enough for all of us for a total of $50.  We did not get any bread or sides.  With apps or sides the paella dish would feed 4-6 people.  The dish itself was very good with a nice amount of mussels, shrimp and clams along with chicken and sausage.I honestly don't understand all these negative reviews. I am a super picky eater and I loved the food here. The spice rub on the spare ribs and the chicken were SO good! It reminded me of the home cooked BBQ I had when I was younger. The BBQ sauce was also really good although I like mine a little more acidic. The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the mashed potatoes but I couldn't put my finger on what I didn't like about it other than the fact that they just didn't taste right. But the potato salad was to die for!Made the mistake of coming during Octoberfest.  Put my name on the list with an expected wait time of 1 1\/2 hours.  Bought 2 beers and waited and waited and waited.  At the 90 minute mark, I asked the hostess as to how much longer.  She said there were 8 table ahead of me.  Waited another 30 minutes and the same hostess said there were 6 tables ahead of us.  I then walked through the restaurant and counted 14 tables that were empty.  Apparently they were extremely understaffed.  How could they not expect large crowds during their busiest time of the year?!  Since I dropped $25 at th bar, Iasked for passes to the tent, which I was told no as I didn't buy an entree.  VERY DISAPPOINTING!!Out of the way but great food, and, John Mull's is a HUGE supporter of our American Legion Riders Post 149 veteran assistance fundraiser events so vets get out there and support Kill Grill when possible. And, I've gone there long before joining the post and would say the same thing about the food!!My boyfriend's mom ordered some Barro's Pizza for us one time, and I ordered again at our place. It pretty much tastes like Jet's Pizza from back home, and I love it. Lots of cheese and the crust is nice and soft. The prices are very reasonable too--there is always specials and coupons floating around.Great sandwiches and great variety!  Breakfast and lunch. Probably wanna try n stay away from the salads as it's not always fresh produce.I love Tropical Smoothie but this has got to be one of the worst locations to go to. It took me 30 minutes to get a smoothie and a wrap. On the usual, I get it in less than 10 minutes. It wasn't even busy. There were 3 workers and 2 customers only. The other customer was getting impatient as well and she had only ordered one smoothie. 

Besides the service, my wrap looked like a mess. It wasn't fully stuffed and it wasn't easy to eat since it was all over the place. 


I'd love to go back here since it's near my job, but someone post a review when they're back on track.Excellent Pizza that lives up to the reputation. The cheese was delicious and toppings were hearty. Looking forward to ordering Fiori's again!Me and my wife love this place!

We've been here three times in the past year and will be back again in August.
The margaritas are strong and they don't skimp on alcohol on their drinks!

The bartenders are super cool and one that usually tends to us is a spitting image of Ian Ziering. At least we think so :) 

We see a lot of reviews talking about price and I do respect everyone's opinion but we come to Vegas to party not to cut coupons. The prices are right in line with other TV star restaurants. 

Although we don't see them on the online menu now the short rib nachos are amazing!!!
Please don't discontinue this appetizer!!!

This place usually gets packed and since we stay at Caesars most of them time we make are rounds until their is room at the bar.

One funny thing that happened on our last trip is some tough guy sits at the bar and basically demands they change the channel on TV to another sports event. Props to the other bartender that handled him very professionally. 

We'll see you guys again in August!!We are visiting the area from OKC to attend my husband's work conference- a bunch of restaurant chain GMs who meet yearly. We LOVE Texas Roadhouse and visit often back home in OKC. Our home location has set the bar pretty high in all areas of restaurant experience, I'll admit, but this location really fell flat. 

The hostess started walking us to our table before it was even clean. I found it very odd. We all stood there, just awkwardly watching the busser clean the table. Before he had even finished (we obviously hadn't sat down yet), the hostess sat the plates and silverware down and wished us a good meal and walked away. It seemed a bit rude, but whatever. Not that big of a deal, although odd.

It took several minutes for anyone to come by to greet us and get our drink order. It was probably about 7-10 minutes or so. As a former server, and sitting at a table with 3 current restaurant GMs, we found that outrageous. Finally the server came by and got our drink orders. We were also ready to order since we'd sadly had several minutes to decide before he even showed up.

Then, the food seemed to take forever. My 3 year old, whom I will admit was already tired, actually fell asleep before it arrived. At least the four salads came out fast and tasted good, but nobody ever offered more bread to us and the server didn't even stop back to check on us while we waited for the food. We stacked up our salad bowls, forks, and small plates at the end of the table and watched him walk by it countless times, empty handed. Again a big strike for us. He stopped by to grab the dishes after being stacked there for quite awhile, and didn't offer anything else or really check on us.

Finally he brought out our food but had another server pass it all out as he rushed away, saying he'd be right back. He did not come right back. 

My husband and I both ordered medium rare steaks- mine was fortunately cooked perfectly (although had several tough, chewy pieces) but his was cooked medium. He mentioned to the other server that it was a bit overcooked but not to worry about it; we were hungry and not willing to wait any longer.

Our server came back nearly halfway through the meal to check on us. Honestly it wasn't worth us listing out all our complaints because he didn't seem too interested in us in the first place and we figured it would take half an hour before he got back with us, anyways. Ironically, his name was that of a very fast plane...

We had empty glasses and had to ask a nearby server to get our server for some refills. He didn't even bother asking the waiter to take care of it- maybe he's used to this happening. He grabbed us more drinks himself. I watched as a young couple (also in our server's section) waiting entirely too long to receive their first round of beverages.

It seemed he only had 3 tables total, and several times I saw him stand and playfully converse with coworkers at the POS station like he had nothing to do, so I was a bit confused as to why he wasn't more attentive. We are very easy customers who rarely complain but would not come back to this location if we lived in the area. I am used to seeing a manager walk around and touch tables, making sure everyone has been served appropriately, so it was strange not seeing that- I'm not sure I saw a manager at all, actually, and I was definitely looking for one.

We had to ask for our check and he didn't offer to split it. We were afraid it would take too long to have it corrected so we just used cash to chip in on our portions so we could leave. :\/Went back recently and the quality has declined. I typically find that AYCE places serve cooked food first because it makes you more full earlier on (sodium laden foods). TNT is no different. Quality has declined 3.5\/starsI got the Cotswold plate with brisket (which costs extra). Their brisket was on the leaner side, which I preferred but my husband wanted fattier pieces. I loved their jalapeno cheese grits. There was just enough jalapeno to give the grits a little kick. I wasn't in love with their creamed corn (the weekly side special), but I'm also not a fan of bell peppers and there was a lot of them in it. (The waitress didn't mention it, or I wouldn't have ordered it.) Their apple cobbler was okay, but it was topped with the smallest scoop of ice cream. Probably won't order it again next time. That's right. Next time. Overall, I enjoyed my meal, and I would come again.My family and I came here yesterday, 5\/17 at 12:15 pm for lunch. It wasn't very busy, had maybe 5 tables filled and a few people at the bar. We got seated and ordered and then waited. And waited. And waited. The waitress did not come by once during the time we waited to refill drinks or give us an update. We were about to cancel our orders and leave 45 minutes after we ordered, but then our food came out. No apologies, no acknowledgement of our wait, nothing. 

The food was barely mediocre. I got a turkey, bacon, and avocado wrap that was so salty it covered the taste of everything else. My husband got a French dip that was bland. My onion rings were also really salty and were soggy. I was kicking myself wishing we had gone to Wildflower or Paradise down the street for something lighter and fresher. We spent $40 on a crappy lunch that took FOREVER to get with two hungry kids in tow. Never, ever will I come her again. So disappointed.This is a hidden gem within Richmond Hill absolutely great chilli chicken fusion cuisine beyond reproach. I've got to share many times love it every single time, I tell all my friends at this is the spicy place for Monja cake. Don't miss out on this place be sure to go and try at everything on the menu is absolutely fantasticAs I was reading the previous reviews, I wanted to try Vits pizza, so I called and ordered. The gentlemen who took my order was very nice, The delivery lady was also very nice, 

I ordered the vegetarian pizza, which was very good, The dough wasn't thick and sauce was perfect. I also had the Jalapeno poppers, and they were good as well. I had to try the fried dough and I was very impressed. 

Everything was great! Thanks guys :)I usually don't post any review but their salted cream float just got me! It was so good. They said they made it in house themselves and you can actually taste it! The cream is really rich and it goes so well with their organic tea, especially oolong tea which is my favorite. I also like green tea latte, rose milk tea and brown sugar milk drink. Also friendly customer service and modern interior design.Super trendy place. There pasta is made from scratch. Would definately come back!Love Love Love Cajun Queen. The food is always on point. The service is pretty good as well. My favorite thing here is the Salmon with the Shrimp and ham topping. So so so good. They also have amazing desserts. The one thing I don't like is their choice of rolls. They're way too hard for me. But the food is amazing, atmosphere and service as well! Will always come back.Awesome place! Great burgers and great service! Make sure you get the duck fat fries! Super unique and really delicious. I really want to come back here so I can try more burgers! I couldn't decide what i wanted so i had the server surprise me. She did an excellent job and brought me the trailblazer burger I think? It was such a great mix of flavor! I was really impressed! We also loved the pretzel stick appetizer! Even though it's a brewery our party still brought kids and they had stuff for them too!Unbelievably rude service. Not only we were not acknowledged, attitude and personality were awful. If the bartender\/waitress doesn't like people she needs to get out of the service industry. 

However, the weekend girl Heather is so sweet! 

Do not come during the week 5-??, you'll be disappointed and other yelpers agree.I'm a relatively big del taco fan. I don't eat alot of fast food but if I want some tacos these are quick and some of my fav, specifically the fish tacos they're quite tasty. 
They also have a new like.. lower priced menu that isn't half bad. I would recommend the jacked up bean and cheese burrito off of that menu...My favourite pho restaurant in Toronto so far.

The owner and waiters are really nice and friendly (unlike most Vietnamese restaurants). 

I always get the Pho tai and the Com suon nuong (grilled pork chops with rice) and they never fail to satisfy my Pho craving. It's not perfect. Broth is sometimes a little bland. But it's still better than most places out there. The Cha gio (deep fried spring rolls) are very crispy and yummy!! 

I wouldn't bother visiting any other pho restaurant in this area!I'm currently writing this review sitting at a table here at the good ole Cogburn's... haven't seen our waitress in over twenty minutes (she's literally the only server here on a Sunday afternoon at lunch time?) I had to actually send my sister home with my kids because if you've ever had horrible service out and have small kids you know that every minute is precious and 40 minutes sitting in a high chair waiting for food is a recipe for a meltdown. When our order did finally come two items were simply wrong and not what we ordered but at that point she only gave us the option to wait an unknown amount of time for the right order... so a southwestern burger will have to do instead. I would have rated this place a zero but that wasn't even an option. I sent my card and a full priced bill (even for the items we didn't ask for and were incorrect) back to be settled with her twenty minutes ago so who knows what's going on now... just looking forward to the moment I can walk out of this place and never return.I've yet to visit the restaurant but their bbq sauces are awesome! We sampled their sauces at a festival in Chandler and loved them. Bought 3 bottles and used them up so ordered more through their website. Ordered 3 bottles and 1 was broken during shipping. I notified Brady's and asked if it could be replaced. 3 days later I had a replacement bottle, priority mailed. Awesome sauces, awesome customer service. Brady's is the way business should be done! Thanks for everything!Fun venue to hang and hear some GREAT music with sweet atmosphere! The Band We, Beloved was playing with The Shift and The Scorched. Sounded amazing!OMG. PLEASE come here if you're in the area. their kimchi burger, sweet baby jesus, AMAZING. i love hamburgers and this place delivers. unfortunately i don't remember our servers name but she was extremely nice. we were told the wait was about 30 minutes but we waited less than that. this burger joint is a gem. the oxtail chili cheese fries are also delicious. they also have boba, which is awesome!Easily one of THE best buffets in Vegas. 

The wait is almost always over an hour if not more so be prepared. BUT they just started a new system where you can put your name down and come back after your estimated wait time ends. (Genius!)

Everything, and I mean everything, here is good. 

The oysters, mexican station, creme brûlée, pizza, shrimp, sliced beef, french fries... It's all good!! 

You cannot go wrong at this buffet. 

It's expensive, $50+, but it's the BOMB.

If you're going to check out one buffet in Vegas, this is the one.Delicious! Excellent quality food and wine. I really enjoyed my meal here, it wasn't served in a rush it came out in good time and the care and preparation was evident. I had a mushroom pot pie and my boyfriend had the beet salad which had an amazing dressing. Everything was fresh, they have a tight menu which seems to have everything you might feel like having on any given day.The buffet here for me would get three stars.  I would, however give it six if I could for the regular entrees.  

My partner and I have come here three times and have been blown away each time by the regular entrees.  The Shahi Paneer is to die for.  They do something wonderful with the smokey tomato sauce that just keeps me coming back for more.  

The service is super friendly and attentive and the prices are a bit lower than they are at other indian restaurants in the Pittsburgh area that I have recently visited.  

Don't go for the buffet, order directly from their menu.Patio is super nice and service always good and fast. I ordered a warm chocolate croissant and my drink in a real coffee cup this time, and it taste even better ! (: I always go there when I'm in Cave creek and never disappointed!Horrible! Service\/food...horrible. Damn chef dropped half of my chicken breast on the floor while trying to flip it. Apparently he didn't think anyone noticed...so he cuts my other chicken breast in small little DICED pieces to make it look like I received 2 breasts. What an idiot!! When I complained to the manager, he took over 10 minutes to come over to the table and the idiot chef was already heading back to the kitchen. When I pointed out the breast on the floor (yep! idiot chef left it there on the floor), the manager claimed it was there from earlier and was not part of my meal. Idiots I tell you.....IDIOTS!

And the carpet is filthy, bathroom has no heat...you can smell bleach while eating dinner.We keep expecting their food to be better than the last time. I've had enough. Ordered two spicy chicken combos yesterday at around 5 o'clock. You'd think the food would be fresh during the dinner-time rush. Well, you'd be wrong. The sandwiches and fries were all lukewarm, and both chicken filets were so dry and tough that they must have been sitting under a heat lamp for hours. We ordered an unsweetened iced tea and a Sprite with no ice. Received an unsweetened tea with no ice and a cup of ice with some Sprite in it.

We've previously been treated rudely for having the gall to use the drive thru 20 minutes before closing time. I'm trying to remember if we have ever been served a satisfactory meal there, but I'm having trouble coming up with a single example. I can only assume that the manager is never there or is so incompetent as to defy belief. This location coasts by solely on the reputation of other Wendy's. Do yourself a favor. Go to Burger King or McDonald's down the road, or hike up to the Wendy's at West View Park.We were here recently on our quest to find good dim sum in Toronto.  The place clean and people are nice, but the whole experience was just not that good.   The menu is hard to understand (M, L, XL with not seemingly rhyme or reason) and no prices.

My biggest complain is the dim sum was just not that good!   I've had much, much better (just not in Toronto).

I rated it Almost Not BombasticThis is a jewel of a place. Excellent breakfast & lunch menu. Fresh ingredients, made to order, beautifully. Lovely, lovely owners. Nothing is a bother for them. Highly recommended! If there were more stars I would give themHaving grown up in the east end, I definitely had one of the best options for fish & chips in the city.  Kingsway Fish & Chips is definitely comparable!   The age, decor, and stellar food are all reminiscent of my favourite place in the east.   We ate in, which I don't normally do with fish & chips, but upon arriving, we noticed the decor was very good.I highly recommend them! Great food and the price is right. They have the right size dish for everyone, HUGE or small dishes. The staff is friendly, and the restaurant is laid back and casual. They have a fun theme, and drinks that fit the theme of the restaurant. Give them a try!Walked here for a burger and a beer, and loved the atmosphere and unique offerings. Ended up getting a standard burger and split the poutine offering with a friend. The burger was a little under from what I'm used to, and tended to fall apart pretty easily; the taste was fine and I liked the oka cheese though. The poutine was quite meh.. just didn't have the flavor I expected. Another person in our group had the sweet potato fries and they were excellent, however. Good drink menu too! 

All in all its a neat place with friendly and attentive service; the food musters a two for me but everything else is a solid four.Politics notwithstanding, we decided to hit Chick-Fil-A as a Black Friday breakfast before going to the stores. It was pretty great. We each got cups of coffee; she got a chicken biscuit, and I for a bacon, egg & cheese. My food took a little longer, which I didn't understand, but I suppose it was a bit busy in there. She said hers kind of fell apart, and she was keeping it together with ketchup. My biscuit was very solid and tasted quite good. The bacon was thick and plentiful, and the egg was fluffy without disintegrating. The coffee in both cases was piping hot, and I burned my tongue on first taste, but it made for good road sips. The staff was wonderfully accommodating, as usual and as always.Looks better than it tastes - appetising menu is let down by poor execution. 


Pros: 
Good selection of beers on tap and in tall cans, and reasonably priced.
Nice decor and ambiance - we were able to follow a Leafs game on TV but the volume was low enough to hold conversations. 
Service was cheerful and accommodating, if a bit slow (albeit it was a busy Saturday night). 

Cons: 
The food. My fries were cold - twice. The "carnivore" plate had little protein. The soft-shell crab sandwich was clearly undercooked. Really below par for a bar, let alone a "gastro-pub".Stumbled upon this chic hip Jazzy Joint and LOVED EVERY THING ABOUT IT!! Live Jazz cold beer great food!!!!! Staff was friendly my glass was never empty food was good and the MUSIC WAS GREAT!!!!!Overrated. 
Had a lamb shish kebab and a chicken shwarma. 
Lamb meat was tough, full of chewy tendons that you ultimately had to spit out or swallow. 
Chicken mean was more like sliced thigh. Thick dry pieces. 
Their lentil soup was tasty and excellent. 
Food was well seasoned and the pita was excellent but I wouldn't go back.Amazing beer selection. Overwhelming actually. Crack fries are exactly what they claim to be. Enjoyed a quesadilla as well here.This place is fantastic. We order here from work so much that the people know our names and our typical orders. 

I have had their Chicken Yellow and Green curry (yellow is by far my favorite). My friend has their Red Curry Duck. It is also really good. 

Their Thai Iced tea is also very awesome it helps the burn...and believe me if you have never had Thai food DO NOT ORDER SPICY...no matter how much you think you can take it....you can't. Build up to it.

Love this place and go here at least 3-4 times a week if I can afford it!!Lack of variety, theres shrimp, beef and thats it.

No salmon, king crabs, or any of that stuff needed for a good buffet.

Rather pay 15 more dlls and have the real buffet experience. Woulndt come back here.Worst service we've experienced in a very long time. 

Had dinner here with my wife on Friday night.  We were seated immediately but our server didn't make his first appearance until 15 - 20 min in. We were hungry with an early start the next day so we stayed. 

He was extremely rude, seemed to be in a rush....cutting us off in the middle our order and walking off, returning  impatient as ever, carelessly threw our dishes onto the table, slamming them into each other. Only after our disgusted looks did he finally calm down and the service began to improve slightly.

The only thing saving this review from a 1 star was the food .  We got the gnocchi fritta appetizer, spaghetti and meatballs, penne pasta with a cream sauce and broccoli with chicken (sorry don't remember the exact name and couldn't find it in the online menu).  Favorite dish was the pasta w cream sauce. Sauce was creamy and delicious. All the pasta was cooked to perfection. Least favorite was the gnocchi fritta...was very good but not as good as the other dishes. 

Food was great but I'll never eat here again because of our experience with the server.Some great crepe selection..and I had the pumpkin chocolate milk..if you love pumpkin it's great but I think some other choices might be a better option for a chocolate milk. Overall good place and great atmosphere..I'll be back to try the goat cheese and pear crepe next time!A hidden gem in Richmond Hill and it's my go-to place for ramen if I'm ever craving. Hands down one of the best ramen places in the GTA. I am particularly a fan of their curry cutlet ramen. It's different but so delicious and you can't go wrong with their hokiddo ramen, such a classic and its taste is to perfection. Plus, every bowl comes with a WHOLE egg, not like typical places that give you half. The whole egg pretty much sold me on this place. Pretty much all their ramens are delicious...I haven't been disappointed with anything. Service is wonderful and they have free Wi-Fi. I would definitely recommend this place to all ramen lovers!This place is pretty cool. Kind of glad I found it. Nice place to get a pre or post workout shake. Staff is friendly, place is clean, and service is fast. Can't complain. I had the Vanilla Coffee shake. It's kind of confusing if you don't know much about protein shakes. But they have patience. I also got some meat chips there which is pretty interesting but pretty tasty. The medium sized cups are like extra large! Very nice place. I will definitely be back!I decided to check out unPhogettable for the first bowl of pho that I'd be enjoying in AZ. Tasty broth, chewy tendons, generous meat, and as many bean sprouts, fresh basil, and fresh limes that you can stuff and squeeze into your bowl! Solid bet for a big, tasty, filling bowl of pho at a reasonable price ($8\/9). Convenient location, connected to an Asian grocery store so you can walk on over and stock up on seaweed, longan and strawberry Pocky after finishing your pho.Just tried a footlong hotdog and it was so good. It had sauerkraut ketchup and relish. It was really good and the French fries were really good too. The price is very reasonable too. Good bang for the buck.   





Had pancakes here this morning. They were good and my husband had a breakfast sandwich and he enjoyed it too. Not bad for a fast foodReally bad all around. Went as part of a dealchicken.com coupon.

Awful and slow service.
Pancakes were so hard and overcooked.
Ham on plate when specifically ordered no meat.

Would not come back, even with $20 coupon.I was in your premises on 7-9-2017 (Sun) and it was really hot and so when I approached the bartender to order a cup of ice and water he just stared at me and ignored me while he talked to a waitress there. I stood there for about 3 minutes until she noticed me and she was the one who asked me if I needed anything, so I said, "yes, I wanted to get a cup of ice and water." She told the bartender and he pretended like he didn't hear her and so she repeated herself and he gave me a cup with a few pieces of ice and a little bit of water; even the waitress looked in the cup and asked me if this was enough? I was very upset and very confused because I always go to your establishment without any problems but for some reason your bartender did not want to serve me or give me eye contact. I don't mean to sound racist but I have a feeling he didn't want to help me because I am Black. I know that there were two bartenders that day. One was Asian and he was White but it wasn't the Asian guy it was the White bartender (didn't get his name)  but I have seen him there lots of times bartending. All I have to say is that when I go into a place of business I expect customer service to be good because if I am talking with you politely or asking you a question politely then I expect the same treatment. I hope in the future your employees learn to treat their customers a bit better because if it weren't for customers then your employees wouldn't have jobs. I hope you take this e-mail serious because what happened on 7-9-17 (Sun) should never happen to anyone. Your bartender wasn't very kind and if I go in your place of business again and something happens like this again then I will go to the Better Business Bureau and make a complaint. 







Thank You




An Unhappy Customerred ginger pros: looks amazing the interior work and design of the place to dine is on point. 
the bar looks great for a sports enthusiast and the staff is friendly. 
red ginger cons: the food was ok at best we order for an app chicken avocado. that's all it was for $7 I'll pass. Next we ordered the bento box I order chicken teriyaki with brown rice. the chicken was over cooked and more flavor could have been put into the meal. 
The music selection while your eating is way too loud it sounds like a club for what you can hear on the radio. 
this place has great potential just hire a kitchen staff who can bring more to the table.3.5* for what I ordered, pumped up for neighbourhood feel, & casual, but friendly\/professional service!

"There's nothing 'DIET' about this menu", says the guy running the place to a lady who asks for a Diet Coke.  That about sums it up.

Before you all throw stones at me, I do NOT order the fried chicken.  Now, after the fact, reading all these reviews, I probably should've ordered it, would've loved it, and could've given this place a more favourable review.

I came here after OktoberFEAST at Wynchwood Barns got rained out.  So myself and my partner in crime used our trusty Yelp app to find a place nearby.  Since we were both starving, I didn't really have time to skim through the reviews to see what was worth ordering here.

We ordered:

Fries ($5) - Really good!

The Beast Style (single burger $7.50) - It tasted like a Big Mac, with caramelised onions, and a bigger patty.  You do what you will with this info

"The Castro" (a.k.a. Cuban sandwich) - contained 2 kinds of pork based cured in-house meats with cheese and some citrus-based flavour.  The 'beige' meat was super, uber fatty.  Not sure if that was on-purpose, but not my thing.

The meat was seasoned, but it needed SOMETHING, perhaps a sauce of some sort.  I really wouldn't recommend that item.

Place has a really nice feel to it!  Guy who was running the joint seemed really cool.  Seating only at bar, no tables.

I guess not ordering the fried chicken gives me an excuse to go back? ;)This is my favorite Mediterranean restaurant so far. Its a clean place with freindly  staff. I love their falafel sandwiches with extra veggies. I highly recommend this place.To cut to the chase, I have to inform all readers that Longhorn Steakhouse did provide me a gift card to come back, experience the restaurant and write a review. I don't always write a review after one visit but will do so in this case. It would be nice to come back to check the place out again as my experience this time was mediocre.

That said, the food was almost flawless. They bring bread and butter to the table before the meal. The bread had a good crunchy outside and soft inside. However the flavor left a bit to be desired. Not bad but nothing to write home about - plenty of steakhouse chains with better bread. I gotta admit, I'm not a huge fan of steak. I don't even eat beef often these days. However, my visit with Yelp elite to a different Longhorn for a private event left me rather impressed with their ability to season a steak. Nonetheless, I didn't get a steak this time. Instead I settled for the tilapia over rice with broccoli as a side. This was flawless. Not overcooked (mistake numero uno for most restaurants serving fish) and seasoned to near perfection. The rice was rice. Like the broccoli it tasted a bit watered down but neither were horrible. My starter was a salad with blue cheese and I had no problems there.

My girlfriend stuck with the theme and got a steak medium rare. I never go less cooked than medium on mine. I tasted hers and didn't like it. Most notably, it just wasn't seasoned the way I'd experienced at the private event I attended before. It was bland. She liked it though so...who am I to judge? She got a starter salad and a lobster chowder which I thought was underwhelming. But again, she and I have hugely different tastes and she like it. The craziest thing about this was that her meal was the $13 dinner deal. That's a seriously good deal. The problem I saw was that Longhorn doesn't have any substitution options for this. They really ought to add a chicken breast to the list of proteins. Right now it's only steak. The server said that he'd never heard anyone ask for a substitution before. I believe it - most people come here for steak. Meanwhile, I paid $5 more for my meal.

Aside from the exterior appearance of the restaurant and the way it felt a bit dead inside (weeknight), service was the most unimpressive thing for me. Our waiter probably shared no greater than 50 words with us. When he brought things to our table he never said anything. And never said "I'll be right back with that" etc. to indicate if he was going to get something or come back. Even with the check he was not talkative. No "thanks have a good one". It wouldn't be so bad if he didn't seem annoyed when I tried talking at length with him about how to run the bill (it had a gift card with a limited amount that you had to type in exactly).

In the end, I'm not a huge fan of chain restaurants. These days I eat out less and less. I'm also not always impressed by steakhouses. I don't plan to come back here but it's not a total write off. It's simply not a top-of-my-list type of place.Ever since I was born, and now that it has reopened under the original family management, Pancer's is hands down the best deli in Toronto and one of my favourite places anywhere.

There is nothing better than a hot corned beef sandwiches on fresh rye with a dill pickle. 

I have always wished that they would open up a second location or food truck closer to downtown, but I still love heading up Bathurst to grab a bite when I can.

My whole family was so upset to hear that the restaurant had closed and are thrilled that it has reopened. 

We stopped by during the opening weekend and were so glad to see a lineup out the door and every seat in the place filled. I hope the place stays full and that Toronto deli lovers do not take this place for granted.Blech, blech, and more blech.  Actually, I'll take one 'blech' back because the drinks are pretty decent here.  That's about it.  If you're planning on getting food, I'd recommend the REALLY huge onion rings or the alligator appetizer.  Otherwise, steer clear of the food.  

You might also want to steer clear of the bathroom because at least on the girl's side, the place was like a scene out of a horror movie...or a bar where one too many people have probably thrown up.  The waitress we had was nice, but the guy who greeted us at the door appeared to be drunk.  I wasn't even sure if he worked there.  The place is packed with ASU undergrads, as it's located right across the street from campus, and some other random people (like the guy who greeted us at the door).  My other complaint is that parking sucks, so if you're planning on going to Barney's, you might want to walk.  

Overall, IF I were to return here, I'd probably only go for drinks...or after I'd already had a few and didn't know any better.Service is terrible if you are under the age of 70. Fact. And not just terrible, the (certain) servers are derogatory to a point. Very unpleasant experience. 

An older couple walked in as I got my drink, which was literally 31 minutes after I first sat down, and they were greeted with menus, waters, and a hello. 3 things I would've loved! 

Oh well, all places can't be winners. I'm just here to let you know if you're under 30 ( I exaggerated earlier, sue me) you'll probably have a similar experience. If not, you most likely got one of the 2,that I know of, younger and incredibly pleasant servers. I however will not be returning.Wings, burgers, chicken,  French fries.   Yeah yeah yeah, we've seen this a billion times in the valley of the Sun.  Another chain restaurant with standard, dull American food.I'm very surprised at the amount of low star reviews on this place. I first heard about this place from following Insider Food & travel on instagram. They posted a video of these enormous slices of pizza, and i myself being a pizza addict, had to try it! On a recent trip to Vegas we stopped in on a Monday afternoon around noon and waited in line for about 20 minutes (not bad considering that you're in Vegas and the lines everywhere are bound to be long). The pizza was delicious, and as advertised, bigger than my head! The prices were great as well. $6-$8 for a slice, or  $12-$13 for a combo (pizza, garlic knot, drink) depending on if you're getting pop or a beer. 

There are no tables, just standing room only, so not great for groups. However, great to stop in for a late night snack (they're open till 4am!!). I will definitely be stopping back in the next time I'm in Vegas.Fantastic sushi restaurant! Sleek, always clean modern interior, attentive & quick staff, and delicious, fresh food with affordable prices! Staff is also willing to accommodate for vegan customers, such as myself.Had a reservation for dinner.
We got the patio\/fountain view seating.
Beautiful view.
We shared 2 appetizers.
Tuna tartare and beef carpaccio.
Tuna was ok. But the beef was great. Except my friend doesn't like the cheese part.
I got the salmon, cooked perfectly.
My bf got the octopus. The texture requires getting used to.a group of us went to vegas this past weekend for my cousins 30th bday, and we decided to stay at the golden nugget, as the majority of us prefer to stay downtown. i was really looking forward to staying at this hotel because of the generally positive reviews i have read via yelp and yahoo. 

maybe it had something to do with being spring break, but this place was overflowing with kids, and not teenagers, i mean kids (0-10). who brings kids this young to vegas?? i was with another cousin who has a young son, in which they planned ahead and organized a baby sitter. i counted 7 newborns at the pool! are you kidding me?! on the plus side, the water slide was fun...

the room was nice, but definitely not a room in which you can have a few people crash. i absolutely hated the fact you cannot lock the entrance to the bathroom. seriously, there are two huge sliding doors that open up to a fancy vanity, a lockable toilet room to the left, and a huge shower to the right, but you cannot lock the sliding doors. this would be a great room for a couple, but unfortunately, we requested two queen beds as we knew there would be more people tagging along, and something got fffed up during the reservation, and we were given one king (another reason for the two-star review). also, they make you pay for coffee and water in the room. 

the casino was fun, as i ended up winning, but holy crap, the people were so sketchy. mind you, i love staying downtown, and i know it's a bit seedy, but i was expecting a little bit more from the nugget. i have a feeling that the trash from around town migrate here because it makes them feel less trashy. unfortunately, splashing a fresh coat of paint on a crack house doesn't change the fact that it's a crack house. if this were the el cortez or californian, i wouldn't care, but jazzing something up so much for it to ultimately be a ruse is just pathetic...Do NOT Stay at This Hotel!!!

I reserved this hotel through Groupon.com, and I'm sorry I did.  

AIR CONDITIONING: wouldn't cool the room lower than 76 degrees; called the front desk, a maintenance person came up, allegedly checked everything, however the temperature only decreased by one degree.  By 11pm the air conditioning was still not working properly so I called the desk a second time telling them that I would need another room the following morning. My complaint was met with sarcasm and rudeness, "Well, I can  move you right now!"  I then had to explain that was with an eleven year old, and a person with medical issues, both were exhausted, and it would be worse to relocate at midnight than to wait until the next morning. Mid morning the next day we were able to move, our new room was ten degrees cooler than the first one! We were also given tickets to the breakfast buffet.

KEY CARDS: did NOT work to get into the pool; had to make two trips to the front desk to get new key cards to get into the pool.  The second time we requested keys that actually WORKED, the night manager went with us-his key card didn't work either! 

POOR HOUSEKEEPING: our room was allegedly cleaned however the following items were not replaced prompting two calls to the front desk: toilet tissue (we literally had none), two complimentary bottles of water, face cloths, paper cups to use with the coffee machine, and the drinking glasses that were next to the ice bucket. A discarded tissue was also left on the bathroom floor. 

Again, do NOT stay at this hotel.We've been here a few times and it's consistently enjoyable! Nice salsa bar, but it's not terribly surprising that none of the offerings are particularly spicy. They make a nice guacamole to go with the chips and salsa, so I'd recommend that as an appetizer. 

I like the tacos quite a bit, and the variety on offer means pretty much anyone will be able to find something they'll like. The taco salads are also really good if you're looking for a marginally healthier option. I have not tried the burritos or rellanos, but the tamales are quite nice! I like the black beans more so than the refried, but the rice is probably the most disappointing item served. 

I don't think the iced tea is fresh brewed, so I'd avoid that option. The beer selection is usually quite good, both in bottles and on draft. Tonight they had MobCraft Batshit Crazy on draft, and that's a HUGE win! 

I'd certainly put this more in the Tex-Mex camp thank authentic. traditional Mexican, but it's solid for what it is. Worth a look, especially if you're already over on the East side.Awesome drinks! wonderful ambiance! Outstanding service! All around classy place! I'll be dropping by often! Kudos and good luck! IMy sister-in-law and I are foodies so we were naturally drawn to Beauty & Essex after seeing an article in Eater. I made reservations via OpenTable for a Wednesday evening and off we met in Vegas with our plus ones (my husband and her friend).

You enter through a pawn shop into a dimly lit speakeasy. The menu is tapas style and all of the plates are meant for sharing. Drinks are strong and the service was friendly and attentive. FYI, the bathroom is located outside of the restaurant and doesn't follow NYC's "champagne served in the women's restroom" trend, wah!

Memorable plates:
* Yellowtail sashimi
* Tuna poke wonton tacos
* Grilled cheese, smoked bacon & tomato soup dumplings
* Elote style scallops
* Ice cream and sorbet selection (housemade daily, flavors vary but all of the ones we had were the bomb.com!)

Just "A-OK":
* Cauliflower (but it's hard to mess that up!)

The next time I dine here, I would pass on:
* Short rib mac & cheese (way too salty!)
* Oven braised chicken meatballs (the texture was odd)

Overall, I had a good dining experience here. It's one of the more fun and less "stuffy" dining spots inside the Cosmo, and I definitely would come back again.2 stars because the food was amazing, but the drive through was horrific. I can't blame the time being so long because of fresh food, but I can blame the guy working the window being snooty. Initially I assumed it was a moody teen, however, I was disappointed to see an older gentlemen being disrespectful to me and my friend. He initially got irritated while he was taking our order, and my friend asked for a drink that wasn't on the menu, unknowingly, and then his demeanor completely changed... I don't know if he had a bad night, but we were nothing but respectful to this gentleman and received nothing but poor customer service because he was clearly flustered... I have given this dying establishment loyalty for as long as I can remember. I am disappointing with the service I received tonight.Great fresh food. The rolls on the front of the menu are excellent!! I've only had the vegetable pho (veghead) and that was really delicious too!  Great selection of drinks at the bar and a very friendly staff.  

I will definitely return and will recommend to friends.Tried to eat here last night with my husband, while on a bike ride. Well the Manager tells me our bikes can't be in the store, that they were a hazard, the store had 1 customer. Our bikes we're safely beside our table, the store wasn't busy, they were mopping the entire store at the time. I'm not sure what happened to good customer service. Or what he issue was, we spent $20 and had to sit outside and eat, on the curb, with our bikes looking inside a empty store at 845pm in PHX. Very irritating.No hands down, it's the best pizza in the burgh..I really missed Bloomfield..Took the kids there every weekend. Great ITALIAN HOAGIES..10 years later,  mom's still asking too bring some home, if I'm in the area..Seriously. This place is a must!! The bison burger and truffle fries were phenomenal!!!! Best burger I've had!!! I've never had figs on a burger but I'm totally into it now!!Wow. Loved it. If Michelin were in Canada, I'd be supportive of assigning them with one star.I can't believe this place doesn't have more reviews! There is something so satisfying about buying an Isaly's chipped chopped ham sandwich right from the source. The sandwiches I bought here were so good and wow I can't believe I'm raving about something as simple as a ham sandwich but man it was memorable. This is seriously one of the last remaining Isaly's locations so it really should draw more attention than it does. Unfortunately no Klondike bars (they were invented by Isaly's) because apparently Isaly's lost the naming rights to Klondike bars or so I heard. Get the chipped chopped ham!I've frequented this casino since 2009 and fast forward to 2017 it is still a trendy upscale casino. I recommend clientele to get suites here as many rooms face the strip. The casino has good ventilation, parking is very organized despite charging vegas locals now.It's a Waffle House. Years pass by and I see one and decide to eat at it. I ordered some eggs, pecan waffle and a cheesesteak melt. It's all very plain. Reminds me why I go years in between eating at Waffle Houses.So i always eat here but then again i ordered chicken strips and the cashier told me it will take 10 minutes so i waited for more than 10 minutes then i went to my car and eat my food but the chicken is stale and cold.I thought they are going to give me a new one but they did not.Never have had a bad experience dining here - if you're looking for a nice Italian dining option on the Las Vegas Strip - consider Martorano's! On this visit we sat at the bar and had the terrific Nate for our server - we started off with the meatball & salad (even to share between 2 people) - you get chef's famous big meatball and nicely seasoned Italian salad, for main course we had one of the evenings specials - the You Cuz Linguini with fresh shellfish and one of our regular favorites the Penne al Vodka. We finished off with a slice of decadent cheesecake. The entrees are served family style so definitely suitable for sharing - there's not too many side offerings but I've had the sautéed greens before. They have daily specials so be sure to check on in the Ipad. Entrees range from about $28 - $50 for most. Convenient location at the Paris and since the one at the Rio has been closed - this is the spot! They are only open for dinner. Don't miss out - check it out and you'll leave happy and full! ;-)Definitely a place we WILL be returning! Service was wonderful, if a bit over-attentive. The comfortable\/friendly decor & ambiance suits the food, location and the folks working :D 

Grilled Shrimp Po-Boy: holy cow, the total BOMB! Perfect combo of savory & sweet & spicy. An absolute must! 

Grilled Cheese: although grilled to perfection, the bread to cheese ratio was waaaay off. Very disappointing... even adding the bacon. 

Homemade Potato Chip: rock-so-hard-core. Perfectly cooked; crisp not soggy. NOMS!!  

Tomato Soup: meh... Nothing special, sadly. Kinda bland. Not enough pepper\/spices. Didn't really enhance the grilled cheese any.

Side Salad: super yum! Great mix of fresh unique veggies... W a killer lemon vinaigrette dressing

Pancake: omg, yes please, moar please! Perfectly cooked. Soft on inside & crisp on outside. Soaked up the 100% maple syrup like nothing I've ever seen. 

The po-boy and pancakes totally won us over... We WILL be back!This location needs to hire employees who speak English. It is very difficult to order a pizza when the person on the phone is not able to speak the same language as you. I ordered a medium Canadian pizza and ended up getting a large Hawaiian.Came here really late. Kitchen closes at 10, but they can still make you a delicious pizza. 
We had pierogi pizza and plain cheese. They were both great. 
Crust is thin which I love.
Friendly people!Herb Box is always a comfortable place to go with nice atmosphere and service. This was the first time having breakfast for me. I went with the scrambled eggs and bacon breakfast. I would know what to say if scrambled eggs are bad, but when they're  good, they're good. These were good. The bacon was crispy good and the toast was great. I'll give credit to the jam. The negative part of my breakfast was when my very friendly and efficient server filled my empty coffee cup with more coffee and I didn't realize it. I pulled it toward me and spilled it all over. No star deduction for customer error.Food was served cold from the first bite and the waiter scolded us when he brought our food back to us warmed to luke warm that we needed to eat faster and not be talking.  Then he ignored us the rest of our visit.  I had to ask twice for the bill.  It was fairly busy so maybe the owner needs to hire more staff, beside the child labor that was there on the day we went.  Very poor experience, will not go again, and will not recommend to anyone else.Celebrated Taco Tuesday today by trying Ni De Aqui Ni De Aya after reading about them in the Phoenix New Times. Had some delicious tacos al pastor that included pineapple, onion and cilantro with your choice of green or red salsa, but couldn't pass up the opportunity to order their famous Pambazo. This awesome torta sandwich came with perfectly toasted and spicy bread filled with carne asada, pinto beans, lettuce, cotija cheese, & crema fresca. It was the perfect mix of flavors and textures. So glad we got to try it and we'll be back now that we know we can find them behind the McDonald's on 7th St. And McDowell on Tuesdays from 11:15 am to 1:30 pm.No jacket required. At least during the summer months. Found many people in shorts and t-shirts. I guess they relaxed the attire code. Good food and service.Just had another fish taco platter and this place makes me happy. The manager running the register made it a fun atmosphere,  even though the place was packed. The whole family loves it here. It would only be better at the beach.Sushi Bros is delicious! We came here for a family dinner and everyone got something different to share. Everything we got tasted amazing. Great food and great service. I would recommend this place to anyone in the mood for sushi or Asian cuisine!We decided to try Elements out for brunch since my fiancé's parents were visiting from Ohio... I had read and heard some great things about the restaurant and the view. Expecting it to be busy, I was happy to find that there was ample seating outside available that overlooked the pool, grounds, and mountains.

All of the staff was very pleasant and courteous. Upon receiving our drinks and appetizers, we were delighted to be served fresh complimentary (and warm) cinnamon rolls! So yummy!

My huge drawback and what ruined what was otherwise a very pleasant brunch, was the extreme lull from the time we had our first drink and put in our food order, to the time our food arrived. We had to have waited 45+ minutes and during that time, were not offered a refill of the specialty drinks ordered or an explanation as to what was taking so long. 

Our food was great, I ordered the breakfast veggie wrap with fingerling potatoes. We also ordered an Ole Bay Jumbo Shrimp app that was tasty, though tad bit overdone with the seasoning.. Some of the pieces of shrimp were almost entirely coated in ole bay.

Id be interested in coming back eventually but would rather try out a few other upscale brunch spots before returning.Normally, I'm a fan of The Palazzo.  Love it there  .... but, when going with kids, staying at the Mirage was simply a better choice.  It just *seems* more kid friendly.  

We spent the week in the 2-bedroom version of the Tower Suite and it was, well, SWEET!  Floor to ceiling windows in all rooms, colors were dark woods with red (unlike the lime green on the hotel website), spot on strip view (and truthfully, the kids room had a better view than the master simply because of where the bed was placed), 52" flat screen in the living room, 42" flat screens in the bedrooms and 32" flat screens in the bathrooms and a crazy comfortable bed .......all wrapped into 1650 square feet of fabulousness.  

I will say this though .... the shower in the (insanely large) master bath had the worst water pressure evah.  If you have long, luxurious locks be prepared to spend some time rinsing out your shampoo and conditioner.   

Location is awesome and walkable to all the places we wanted to go.  The pool looked cool but was closed (and drained) for the winter.  I'd love to check it out when the weather gets warmer!kabuto review #2
I rarely revisit the same restaurant within a week....but this place deserved another visit and I'm already planning to go back yet again next week.  I think I'm becoming a Kabuto-addict as many are going to be if you have been yearning for an authentic edomae style sushi.

They started an Omakase menu today, so I gave that a try.  

The difference between Omakase and Nigiri course is that they include miso soup as well as sashimi plate that included blue fine tuna, houbou (blue fin robbin), and kasuga dai (baby sea bream) as well as grilled plate, in which today they had Kamasu (barracuda? sort of), australian wagyu, and anago (salt water eel) with sansho spice with anago liver.  It did come with pinapple flavored sake aperitif as well as today's sakizuke (amuse bouche) was grilled kasugodai (baby sea bream) and wakame salad.  

Nigiri started out with Kinme (golden eye snapper or alfonsino), blue fine tuna, kanpachi (amberjack), kisu (sand whiting), surume ika (squid), ishidai (striped beakperch), blue fin tuna chutoro, then negitoro hand roll.  I also ordered hotate (scallops) and aoyagi (orange clam) a la carte.  In Omakase, it doesn't come with tamago (eggs) which nigiri course comes with.  

I believe that most fish came from Japan again, except for clams (hotate, orange clam from boston), amberjack from kona, HI, and Tuna from Spain again.  They only received 3 Kisu from which they can only make 2 sushi from each fish, so that was pretty nice for itamae-san to save it for me, as kisu as a sushi ingredient is not very common even in Japan as it's a tricky fish to prepare.  It's used a lot in Tempura.  

I feel that Omakase is great for those people who want to drink some sake beforehand and eat some sashimi and grilled fish before starting Nigiri.  If you are a straight nigiri kind of person then I'd probably stick with nigiri course.  

I just can't say enough good things about this place or hide my excitement.  I love the fact that most of the fish is different from week to week as they get different fish as REAL sushiya does instead of having the same old same old frozen\/defrosted fish.  

Several words of advice for the edomae sushi noobs:
  1)  don't ask for soy sauce. You don't need it unless you have sashimi or hand roll and the wait staff will bring it to you as it becomes necessary.  Besides, they use a special soy sauce that's aged 3 years, so they certainly don't want to leave a big container for people to pour out liberally.  Don't ask for extra wasabi as there is no need for it. Putting wasabi in soy sauce is a huge no-no as it destroys the flagrance.  

  2)  Try to use your fingers, not chopsticks.  If the itamae sees that you are using a chopstick then he will probably make the nigiri a little firmer so that it doesn't fall apart, but nigiri needs to be soft enough with enough air in the rice portion so that it falls apart as you put it in your mouth.  The proper way is to pick it up with your fingers (thumb\/index, middle finger), then rotate it and put it on your tongue with fish part facing down toward your tongue.  In most sushi places you may need to dip the fish part (NOT rice) in soy sauce, therefore nigiri needs to be inverted anyway, but in a proper place like Kabuto, soy sauce is already painted on so it's not necessary to dip in soy sauce.  You want to put the fish down first so that you can feel the texture of the fish, and you do NOT want to put the rice on the tongue first because vinegared sushi rice is too strong of a flavor for you to enjoy each fish's texture\/flagrance\/taste. 

3)  Do not insult the itamae by ordering NON edomae neta (sushi ingredient) such as salmon, unagi, or any silly sounding rolls because they won't have any of that.  Instead, ask the itamae for some edomae neta, which are not commonly seen in the U.S., which are things like anago, kohada (shad), nihama (cooked clam), saba (mackerel), etc.  Can you tell what they have in common??  Yes, they are all cooked or vinegared.  In Japanese, we call them sushi netas that have some "work" done to them.  It takes more skill\/time\/experience to make them as opposed to just cutting raw fish, but those are the classic edomae neta's that separate the real sushi ya's from the wannabes.

4)  As it is still BYOB, try to go out and get yourself some real sake to go with your sushi.  A good sake will go VERY WELL with sushi, especially properly vinegared sushi rice. If you don't like sake, you probably haven't had a good one.  Go to place like total wine and look for a JYUNMAI sake, meaning pure rice sake.  It is sad to admit that the Japanese sake industry has been corrupt for decades, and big companies like shochikubai and ozeki have been making crap sake with additives for decades.  You want to get jyunmai sake that is made of rice and water, nothing else.  Or even better, GINJYO or Daiginjyo are premium sake made from shaved down rice only using the central part, which has more of a fruity aroma.Dined last night for an early dinner around 4pm. I was not greeted right away matter of fact 3 employees past me prior to what appeared to be a manager tell me she would be right with me. The restaurant was slightly busy with large parties and tons of take-out orders. The server who walked us to our table ended up being our server during our dining experience. She started off very friendly but then ended up being very rude. Her exact words were that we were making her life difficult. This was because we told her what we wanted for desert when we placed our order. This was only to be proactive. Well we requested our baked cookie to have the ice cream and toppings on two separate plates. This meaning one plate with the baked cookie and the other plate with the ice cream toppings. I am still trying to figure out what is so difficult about that. Especially when she is not the one who is preparing it. The good news was the food was great and came out in a timely manner. Our table split a Pizza and Wings. It did take a while for us to get our desert however this may be because our server got another table? Which they were not happy with her either since she did not come across friendly to them. This was my first dining experience there. I have always ordered take out. I would have had a good experience if the server was friendly. I could tell she did not like her job because prior to setting me she complained about the children that were dining before us and the mess they made. This was service minus the smile.How is this place still in business.   My family went last night on the recommendation of a neighbor who grew up in the area.   My daughter ordered a pizza that was a warmed up frozen pizza.  I had a greek salad with beets and my husband had veal parm that was "congealed".  My husband wanted angel hair instead of spaghetti and we were told it was possible... for $3 more.  I know many restaurants have fees for special requests but this was just which box of pasta to throw in the water.  The cheesecake is like a slice of bread from a loaf pan which was chunky and had not been thoroughly mixed to be smooth...ugh!   I will add that our waitress was quite lovely and felt awful explaining the up fee for a simple pasta change as well as keeping our drinks full and was horrified that the cheesecake was something the kitchen knew about yet served anyway.  If it's world famous it's because it might be the worst place still in business.  ......calling Gordon Ramsey......Le steak était très moyen et pour 27$ + tx + tips, c'est vraiment dommage. Au goût, ça ressemblait a de la viande de mauvaise qualité et il y avait beaucoup de nerfs dans mon morceau mais aussi dans celui de plusieurs personnes avec moi.
Les frites aussi sont médiocres, peut être justifié par le fait qu'elles sont à volonté. 
J'ai très peu apprécié le message sur le menu qui dit que comme c'est un "apportez votre vin" il n'est pas permis d'avoir une facture sous les 20$. Je trouve cela hypocrite, déplacé et impolis. 
J'ai été aussi un peu étonné de voir que le tips était directement pris sur la facture. Je n'apprécie qu'on décide du tips pour moi cependant, et c'est peut-être le seul point positif, le service était très efficace. Sympathique et rapide, il a valu une deuxième étoile sur ma critique.Last year I would have given the B-Spot a 4-5 star rating, but the Turkey burger was inedible (think reconstituted chicken patty then over cooked) and my nephew's mini burgers were charred to death. Gone down hill on quality.Well I made the mistake of not using my trusty YELP app before I ordered from this place. I received a flyer for this restaurant under the door in my hotel room. I called and after a brief and not so friendly conversation with a man on the other end I was told the food would arrive in 30 minutes. When I told him I wanted to pay with a card he upped the price to a random evan dollar amount so that seemed shady in itself. After 1.5 hours I called back to see the status and got some serious attitude from the same guy telling me the delivery boy had 3 other delivers so it was going to take some time and to be patient. 15 minutes AFTER that some tweeker kid shows up with a cold pizza and soggy fried zucchini! Never never never get food from this gross excuse for a restaurant! Soooooooo not work $34 bucks! YUCK!!!My latest experience with this restaurant wasn't great.  

I had called in my order via phone, and was hoping for it to be ready as soon as I arrived.  Unfortunately, the food was not ready (or so I was told) when I arrived, so I had a seat to wait for it to be completed.  While I was waiting, I noticed that underneath the heat warming lamps were a few bags of food however, and I assumed this was for a different individual.  Anyways, as time passed and I waited, the store employees were all banded together talking.  Finally, after about ten minutes, I decided to ask if the food under the lamp was mine, and sure enough it was.  This pissed me off, and on top of all that, the burger was burnt & cold. 

I don't think I'll be returning.This sports bar has recently opened in the Lake Wylie area.  It was the former Lake Wylie Gator restaurant and bar.  They look to have daily specials, Monday's are $0.50 wings and peel and eat shrimp.  This restaurant \/ bar also has a good sports bar feel with quite a few TVs.  The menu is made up mostly of bar food like hamburgers, hot dogs, cheese steaks, a variety of sandwiches, salads, appetizers, etc.

I stopped in here with some friends for some food before heading to the shooting range in Clover.  Most entree's run in the $8-$10 range.  The cheese steak with fries is $8.99 and comes with onions, mushrooms, and peppers.  It's a decent steak and a tad bit on the messy side but still not bad.  It came with what looked to be nacho cheese so I probably wouldn't get it again as I like white American on a good cheese steak.  You really don't see cheese steaks with yellow or nacho cheese on them.  One of my friend's had the wings which looked good and like your typical hot wings.  They commented that they were pretty good, but basically your standard hot wing.  

All in all this place has pretty decent bar food and one of the better places to watch sports in the Lake Wylie area.Dudley and Dudley is a great cafe with really wonderful, friendly owners. They speak both english and french, so it's comfortable talking to them, both for me, who can speak french, and my boyfriend, who only speaks english.  I don't drink coffee, so I haven't tried any of theirs, but at least once during the weekend I stop in for a sandwich and something sweet. Their sandwiches are generally around 8 or 9 dollars, I think the price varies depending on the ingredients, but they are absolutely amazing, and are very different from the usual sliced meat and cheese on a baguette. I'm talking porchetta between two slices of focacia with artichoke type of amazing. As far as sweets, they have french and italian viennoiseries as well as traditional cookies and muffins, and I've enjoyed everything I've tried so far.  If you're ever on the corner of Gilford and Chambord, do stop in, you won't be disappointed.This restaurant is such an incredible experience! Every time I come in I receive immaculate service. Great drinks, awesome food, and incredible desserts! You can also control the music which I think is really cool. Five stars!Visiting Las Vegas first time to Tacos Huevos. Saw the good reviews on yelp and walked a mile to get here. Well worth it the reviews are correct. Great fresh food and the owner \/ employees absolutely  best customer service.The food here is solid.  Service is always very friendly and prompt.  Portion sizes are on the larger size and pricing is in line with standard diner fare. The is the perfect location for a downtown stay good for business lunches.  Business lunches at this location are a perfect fit with their location and the speedy service.  Fantastic atmosphere in the heart of the Beltline.The food is not worth waiting for 25 minutes to place and order. Not only to we wait, but the apology was unprofessional and half-hearted. For the trouble, one free dessert was offered. Really, one free dessert offer after waiting for 25 minutes to place and order? Not sure what type of establishment the owner\/manager is really, but this is our first and last time supporting this business. Back to Lawan's on S. Tryon we go, where the food has always been great, and the service is professional and consistent. What were we thinking trying another spot? We're going to stick to what we know, and we know Lawans!I got a pack of those City Dining Cards (you get $10 off on a $30 minimum food purchase at participating restaurants) and decided to use the Olive or Twist card for a dinner prior to seeing the Phantom of the Opera at the Benedum.  I've been to this place once before for dinner and a couple of other times just for drinks. I've never really been blown away by my experiences there but I've never had any reason to complain either.  I got there at 6:00 and the place was pretty packed with the happy hour crew and theater goers but I got lucky and nabbed the last two stools at the end of the bar. I was greeted cheerfully and almost immediately by the bartender who showed me the beer list. I choose to stay local ordering an East End Fat Gary and looked over the menu as I waited for my date to arrive.

Although it was a little loud, the atmosphere was very comfortable and my lady and I contributed to the noise as we discussed how our day went before ordering off of the menu. I was torn between the Crispy Braised Pork Belly Sandwich and the Pan-Seared Atlantic Char. But my decision got easier when my date choose the char... we have this rule that we will never get the same thing so that we can share each other's entrée.

Our orders came about 15 minutes later. The pork belly was amazing! Cheddar, bacon, lettuce, tomato and a creamy sauce topped the pork belly in between a really fresh Ciabatta bun. Mmmm, delicious! It also came with a side and being as cold as it has been, the tomato basil soup was nice compliment to the sandwich. Off course I got to taste the Atlantic Char that my girlfriend ordered. It looked and tasted a little like a good cut of salmon only a little thicker and saltier. It was good, but I really think that my sandwich was the tastier of the two meals.

Olive or Twist? I'd say it's a good pre-theater option and I'd recommend it. The service was good, the bartender was attentive, the food was excellent and the price was competitive for the area. My only knock, and it's really not much of a knock, is that I think the serving portions are a little less than what we here in America have grown accustomed to. Most restaurants serve you much more food than you really should consume and that's one of the reasons why we here in America have more of an obesity issue than other nations.I am now and forever will be a part of the BIG VIEWER fan club!!! A great selection, perfect size and the desserts are soooo super duper scrumpdillyishous! Whether you want a simple soup and salad, or light and tasty salad with homeade dressing, a sandwhich that eats like a meal, or a nice choice of finger foods, this is the place. Love the party room and the fact they accommodated our large group.  So hard to find restaurants with good food, pretty things to look at, and reasonably priced (given that side of town), not to mention the excellent service.  I also love that the head Chef, Frank walks around to say hello.  I even looked in their kitchen and bakery and knew this was my favorite because the floors were clean.  No employees smoking in fron or on the side of the building and the bathroom, though it was crowded to capacity, DID NOT remind me of a horror movie...... I was happy that my critical group of picky eater girlfriends were all satisfied with he selection and we definitely had a GREAT time....Love Red, convenient new location not far from the capitol. Love their sushi (wide variety of options on the menu) and great appetizers.This is one of the places that you have to try in order to call yourself a "Clevelander". It's best known for having the best & biggest corned beef in Cleveland. This is a smallish sit down restaurant, but there's nothing fancy inside; no-frills decor and typical of an 80s diner. The only thing I've had here was of course the corned beef sandwich. 

So how big is the sandwich? It's massive, I would say a good pound of slice corned beef, in between two pieces of rye bread. It's piled about 4-5" high. You'll definitely want to knife and fork it. I'd be impressed if you can actually take a bite at it. The flavor from the meat is very good and wasn't dry or too fatty. I also had a side of coleslaw and fries. They were OK, but it complements the corned beef with a bit of veggies. You won't come here for that anyhow, so you shouldn't be disappointed if these were a let down. 

However, the prices have gone up at this place in the last few years, but at $12 a sandwich, its worth it for the experience and to proudly say that you've eaten at Slyman's!I've only been in a few times, because it's hard to disassociate that location with Vons.  I never cared for Vons- the Vons produce was generally horrid and the Vons check-out lanes were always backed up and slow.  Well, I went back to Haggen yesterday, and the produce stocker proactively asked if he could help me find something - I was never asked that when it was a Vons.  And, the Haggen brands of cheese and ice cream have been pretty good.  The selection of craft beer is better, and so is the selection and overall quality of produce.  And, the checkout lanes have been faster every time I've been in there.

I'm not sure if Haggen has clearly defined its place in the market; it's supposed to be better quality and service than Vons\/Smiths\/Albertsons, and thus higher prices on some items.  But, they're not striving to be a Whole Foods. 

Will I buy everything here?  Probably not, but I never have given all my grocery business to one store. There are some good deals to find here, and for the over-priced items, I don't mind driving 5-10 minutes to shop for them.  And, I realize that you can't transform an entire philosophy in 2 days, or 2 weeks or 2 months.  The transition is a process.  There are already a few areas where I see Haggen as an upgrade over Vons, and I anticipate continued improvement over time.This place is awesome! Great coffee, great food and Elvis. You MUST try an Elvis!!  I stop by on the way to drop my kids off at school. Call my order in and run in and pick it up!!  Great service!! Seriously love this place!!!Apparently they got new menus? Well they suck. My boyfriend and I both ordered chicken sandwiches, mine had buffalo sauce on it I wanted to add blue cheese for a dollar, it came out with a side of blue cheese dressing. Uhhh ok, ill just dip. Chicken sandwich tasted like they sprayed that shit with windex the fries were colder than ice. We both thought it was odd the sandwiches came out so fast. It was like they were hanging out under a lamp. Gross! For the price you pay here for food I was extremely annoyed. Go here for a few laughs, couple drinks but don't waste your money eating here.I just got back from a weekend bacehlorette party at the Cosmopolitan and, though I would love to give it five stars because the suite we stayed in was amazing, there were so many issues with it that I had to settle for three.  When we arrived, we realized that the air conditioner didn't work at all and was just recycling the hot air throughout the rooms.  We called down to have it fixed and they sent up an incredibly helpful mechanic, but hours after he worked his magic, it seemed to be back to recycling hot air again and did so for the rest of the weekend.  This wouldn't have been a huge problem if it wasn't the middle of the summer and 105 degrees outside.  We also had issues with our refrigerator, which wasn't working, and had to have it replaced...THEN we ended up waiting for an hour and a half to get linens for our pullout bed in the middle of the night.  They kept telling us that housekeeping was incredibly busy, but we didn't understand how that could possibly be the case when it was three o'clock in the morning and our entire floor was practically empty.

After the bachelorette complained to the manager, however, we were offered complimentary breakfast from the resident buffet restaurant, Wicked Spoon, which was absolutely amazing.  Best gourmet buffet brunch I have ever had by far.  

I would definitely recommend the hotel once it's had gotten a little more established.  I think it's still new and working through the kinks but has the potential to be pretty amazing.This place is amazing and my 3 young children love it. We are regulars now. Baja and Derado tacos are my favorite.I never realized how much my grandparents made food very close to this.  They were from the mainland of North Portugal.  Most of the food there is Greek influenced there.


This place brought lots of great memories back for me.  Freshly cooked to order right in front of you.  I went with a $6 small chicken and rice bowl without tomato sauce (tomato allergy).  My boyfriend had a $7.50 regular gyro (hero) about half way through he was getting full!  I tried the meat in his gyro and it was amazingly tender.  My chicken was very tasty and flavorful.  The cooked veggies were taking in the flavor of the grill and it was great. I don't normally eat my veggies but I'm trying to eat more greens.

I swear this food tastes just like my grandpa's cooking. Staff and owner are super friendly and accommodating too. I wish it wasn't so far from Summerlin but if we are in the area, I would go out of my way to stop thru for a healthy choice again.This place gave me food poisoning.  An hour after I ate. My stomach started hurting and then as I suspected. Bathroom time. Smh. The pizza LOOKED soooo good. I can't believe it was contaminated. Please guys WASH your hands and practice better FOOD handling skills!!This place is so awesome! The customer service fabulous and the food is just as great! We have been here every week since we discover it! The environment is kid friendly and you don't have to wait long for your food.Took my grandson and his girlfriend here for a birthday lunch and couldn't have been more pleased, the food was excellent and our hibachi chef was great !The happy hour was amazing and the atmosphere is so impressive! The bartender did a great job with the drinks. Decided to try things that I had never had before and was very impressed.Went Mothers Day @ 4:00. They had a limited menu and was already out of ribs. Dirty fries were tasty and the frito pie was disappointing. The portions, both meat and sides were fine. Cocktails come in SMALL mason jars and we're a little weak. Only iced tea is sweetened, no other options. Brisket was moist, tender and flavorful. Only real complaints were the chicken arrived to the table FRIED!!!! No mention that it was fried or else my wife would not have ordered and nothing for kids. No milk and No kids menu. Kevin our server was cool and on top of things.When you walk in from the street you have to go downstairs, below The Fifth Grill & Terrace. After arriving at the host stand you can go to the right side for the cafe or to the left side for pub\/restaurant. Our bouncy, chipper host quickly took us to our table and assured us that our server would be over shortly.

I really like the atmosphere of this restaurant. It has a very casual yet sophisticated feel. I like the mix of high top tables with high chairs that have backs and the low tables with with short bar stools. The menu was limited because they just opened so everything available was indicated by a red dot next to the name of the item.  We had the tempura pickles for an appetizer. They were served hot and delicious (mixture of pickle spears and pickle chips) with 2 sauces. One was a mayo, lemon, chive dip and the second was a hot spicy tomato dip. Both were really good. 

For dinner I had the sweet potato gnocchi (which was spelled wrong in the menu) served in a hot healthy portion in a tomato basil sauce that looked and tasted homemade. The dish was yummy but the sweet potato flavor was a little too subtle for me, I would've liked to taste a stronger sweet potato flavor but that's just my preference. There was an option to add homemade meatballs but I decided to stick with the regular. If I get those again the next time (because there will be a next time) I will try it with the meatballs. This might just be my preference but I felt like the dish was missing a little piece of garlic toast to go along with the other flavors.

 My fiance got the braised beef sandwich, which I had a bite of and it was delicious. It came with ketchup and a coleslaw that looked to be made of red cabbage and vinegar. It was tasty. She asked him what side he wanted and he picked fries, but we didn't find out until the bill came that the fries were $3 extra. We barely ate any fries and wouldn't have ordered them if we knew they were extra.

There were 3 big TVs behind the bar and I liked that during the game, the music continued to play in the background instead of the audio for the game because it helped to keep an intimate dinner intimate while still being able to look up and check the score. That might not have been intentional since there were a lot of people watching the game but I think it helped to prevent the atmosphere from turning into a sports bar. There were plenty of bar stools as well and what looked to be about a dozen beers on tap.

Now for the service. Our server was very friendly and explained the menu well. She also answered any questions we had. The servers there carry around what looks like a mini iPad, so that as you're ordering your meal, she stands tableside and immediately sends your order. Pretty cool. Our drinks and each course of our meal came out quickly (the restaurant was less than 25% full) and very hot and fresh! Our server did a nice job keeping our water glasses full and our table clutter-free. I did ask about wi-fi because I saw on my phone "fifthcafe-guest" with a strong signal. She gave me what she thought was the password but it didn't work. She apologized and said she'd ask around for me, but I never got an update. In her defense though, I didn't ask about it again because our food started arriving so I wasn't concerned with it.

Instead of dessert, which I wish I had room for, I got a cup of coffee which was really good. I would hope so since they're attached to the cafe. I just wish that I could've had the coffee drink options of the cafe available to me on the pub side, but o well. I'll just have to go again but to the cafe side. A glance over there looked like there might have been some 

Overall I really liked theAs I have said, I love Indian food, so when my friends suggested Moti's of course I was on board!  

We go to the restaurant early, so we were the first of many people to start trickling in.  The inside of the restaurant has a great atmosphere, very well decorated and lit nicely.  We received a friendly greeting and were seated promptly.  One of my favorite details was the brass water cups, that little thing made the experience feel authentic!  Some of my friends had never had Indian food before so they had some questions for the waiter and he happily answered them.  There are a lot of choices on the menu, some very authentic dishes.  My Husband and I had a hard time deciding!  We ordered 3 dishes, one was our favorite veggie dish Gobi Alu and we had to try the tikka butter chicken, which we had never come across!  All the portions were excellent, there was enough for my friends to even try some on our choices.  The rice portions could be a bit bigger.  The naan was perfect!  The food was so good, even though I was stuffed I would have kept eating if there was more!  I even tasted my Husbands mango lassi, it was one of the best I had tasted!  The cost of dishes are a couple dollars more than other places I have been, about $15 for a meat dish, but I didn't mind paying more since you got a good portion and it was delicious!

I can not wait to go back to Moti Mahal!  If you are looking for a delicious, authentic Indian meal in a great atmosphere, this is the place to go!I really enjoyed the attentive service at Le MajesThe. The server explained the whole menu to us when we were seated and recommended a few dishes. They are trying to fusion italian with taiwanese which is interesting. I had a chicken spaghetti with tomato sauce and poached egg. I love poach egg on anything. I enjoyed the spaghetti which had a slightly sweet flavour to it. Portions are on the small side but the prices are not too steep. The bubble tea is served in mason jars which is always fun. They have a good collection of teas which you can have with jelly or bubbles.This is probably the best Italian food I have eaten in years. Had the Sausage And Brocolini. Out of this world. Ordered the Spicy version. It has spunk but very tastefully done. Great place for a casual get together, group meal. Definitely recommend this place to anyone look I g for good pasta.  Will try the pizza next time.Yay, I'm a fan of the Keg Steakhouse. This is my first review after many visits. All my family members like this place. We had my birthday dinner here last month, and today, I took my mom here for a little surprise bday dinner, and yup, just me and mommy. We has a reservation for two at 6:30pm, so we didn't have to wait at all.

For drinks, I ordered an Orange Slice Martini, and mom ordered a glass of 6oz Riesling. The Riesling was just fine, but not that fruity if you're looking for a sweet fruity appetizer drink. I liked the Orange Slice martini, freshly squeezed orange and lime juice with 2oz of vodka, just enough for me (usually martinis have 3oz of alcohol?), this one is fruity!

We shared the Escargots for appetizer.  This is one of my fav, 6 little escargots with mushroom caps, and baked with garlic and herbs, yum! And the escargots are really big!

For our entree, we both had the 7oz Filet Mignon, and they came with a twice baked potato. My medium rare filet was wrapped in a strip of applewood smoked bacon, it added the extra flavor.  It was very juicy and tender, I enjoyed a lot. 

We didn't leave any room for desert at all, the others were too good :) And the prices are good! Oh, did I mention their bread was really good too?

They're having a promotion going during the holiday season, you get a $25 gift card when spend $100+, I got one last time for my bday, so we'll definitely go back soon!I wish I could give 2.5 stars.

I both live and work in the Flats and know all the restaurants here well.  Although I liked this place the first time I came (which is why it's getting three and not two starts), it is definitely not one of my favorites.

My first dinner experience here in November was great.  Our table (of four) shared the brie as an appetizer and we all really enjoyed that, although I just checked and it doesn't look like it's on the menu anymore.  I had a sangria to start and was so-so on it - I didn't hate it, but I doubt I would order it again.  My husband and I then split either a salad with tomatoes and burrata (not currently on the menu either), and despite the cheese overload, really loved that too.  For dinner I had the lobster gnocchi and thought it was really good.  We had wine with dinner and there was a good selection of bottles (I don't recall how the by-the-glass selection was).

The next time we came for dinner in January I was not super impressed.  We had the raclette to start (also not on the current menu), which was good, but way too much for just two of us.  While I debated going with the lobster gnocchi a second time (I wish I had...) I went with the scallops, which were prepared differently then.  They were SO salty I contemplated sending them back.  I didn't because I didn't want to be "that" person, so I guess I only have myself to blame.  Anyway, service was so-so that time, so overall it (literally and figuratively) left a bad taste in my mouth.

Finally, a couple weeks ago I got lunch here to go - and this was strike two.  I ordered a pick two combo and got the caprese sandwich and kale salad.  The caprese sandwich really wasn't that bad, it was just strange... I swear it was served on Texas toast, which is just so odd.  Do they not have focaccia?  Or something else that doesn't look like a fifth grader's lunch?  Also, I swear they used canned tomatoes.  I get that tomatoes are not in season right now, but maybe that means this shouldn't be on the menu?  As for the salad - I do not eat meat so I asked for it without pancetta.  The bartender rang it in properly (it showed up "no pancetta" on the receipt), but I guess someone wasn't paying attention in the kitchen.  Sure enough, it had plenty of pancetta in it, which I didn't realize until I made it back to my office.  Luckily I work in the EY Tower, so I called down and asked them to remake it, which they graciously did.

I will give this place one more shot, so at this point I wouldn't recommend NOT going here, but I also think there are better options in the Flats.Great food, and the owner\/chef is very friendly. My chicken and my husband's pork were very juicy, tender, and flavorful. Everything had that fresh, just-prepared deliciousness. We'll definitely be coming back!Definitely a one of the best kbbq spots in Vegas. Open late, sushi and kbbq, super great price for all you can eat. Awesome service. 5 stars hands down.Its always a pleasure to give out a 5 star rating and this location for me scored 5 out of 5 for food, service, and ambience.  Aside from their great ramen dishes they also offer slow cooked chicken wings, fried chicken, and seaweed salad along with a couple of varieties of sake.  Service here for us was very friendly and attentive, the prices were very reasonable, the portions were generous, and the restaurant itself is very clean with a hip modern decor. This is a great place for a light meal or a snack and a great place to converse with your friends and family as noise levels are relatively low. Keep in mind though, this location can get very busy, but the wait is definitely worth it.Raul is the f*^%%g man! Best bartender ever! Great drinks great service.
RAUL 4 PRESIDENT!!Always great food and service! Sometimes the bar area could use a little more help with wait staff but they try their hardest!! I have noticed on busy nights there is only one wait staff in the bar which is not enough for that area.This Buffalo Wild Wings is a pretty standard chain.  Great selection of lunch and dinner items as well as a nice beer menu. Pretty quick service and enjoyable wait staff. As expected, tvs playing the game (or games) everywhere!!Since reopening from the shell of the closed Max's Deli, Sweet Melissa's has gotten better and better.Last Sunday, we stopped in for Sunday Brunch -highly recommended and a great value (I had the Veggie Omlette with Whole Wheat toast and my wife had the twin Belgian waffles. Very good (and the fruit and potatoes that accompanied the dishes were incredable!)Service was prompt and very helpful. Coffee was very tasty. Today I stopped in for a light dinner (Nicoise Salad) which was very well prepared and a generous helping. Dinners are -to me- a smidge pricey (Entree Salad was $12.) Service was excellant and friendy. I'm watching my diet, but the desserts here are legendary and - in fact - are wonderful. (My weakness is their chocolate cake.) Place is very clean. Other favorites - pistacio crusted grouper, fried green tomatoes and eggplant bake (like eggplant parmesan)....Breakfast was good. Only place I have found outside of Washington with Dungeness crab eggs BenedictNice beef short rib soup. Will definitely come back next time! The seafood pancakes also test great.A friend and I stopped in to check out this new restaurant and were pleasantly surprised!  The decor is great, modern and cozy! 
The service was excellent. We were there for happy hour, they have a great selection of wines.
The food was Amazing!  I think it may be the best burger in town!  The burger is served with a bacon jam that is to die for!  We also sampled the Chicken Satay, and it was excellent, moist and seasoned to perfection. What a nice surprise!  Check it out.This is our first time trying  this restaurant because we bought a Groupon (good for four people). It is tucked in a shopping complex. The place is not too small and quite cozy. The decor is simple yet still showcases an Italian atmosphere. 

We are welcomed by our lady host who is both friendly and seem to sincerely enjoy her job. Customer Service is very very important to me and she pass with flying colors! I myself cook so-so Italian food so I can pretty much figure out their recipe, but at least I can say trying a parmesan alfredo cream-sauce pizza for the first time, I must say, it is quite a difference taste (I will surely try to make my pizza this way). My husband definitely liked their 18" specialty pizza alfredo for $18 + add'l chicken for $3.50 and it is good. The "size" is awesome with the thin crust perfectly done (not burned, which is key). You may fold the slice ala-NewYorker style. The bacon bits thought initially as too sparse, but the taste is just right, however, I still would've liked it just a little bit more in there for the price you're paying. The chicken I paid extra is nicely sliced, so can't complain there.

We did have calamari fritti for appetizer, and it is nothing extraordinary from others I've tasted before, it is good but the only thing is, it is a smaller serving than I am used to, so for $9 it is a bit expensive for its size. However, it is a local business and understandably its usual higher pricing. The garlic knots could be a bit bigger, but its taste is also alright. We had the Penne Alfredo, plain in presentation but the taste makes up for it.  It has the crumbled italian sausage which is quite tasty. 

Groupon did suggest the Shrimp Parmigiana Sub sandwich, and although our order brought to our table was incorrect, the hostess graciously acknowledged and had the right one prepared (no big deal). The breaded shrimp is smaller than I expected but with the marinara sauce, and having devoured the pizza + pasta, I just can't seem to taste the sub separately. Since we were stuffed and took home most of the sub sandwich, I can perhaps taste this next day to really appreciate the taste and judge it accordingly.

I did give it 3 stars of 5 only because it is very similar taste to many Italian Restaurants I've been to, but it doesn't mean it is not good. The food is good overall and quite friendly staff, but at this economy and tight business competition, one should really have to invest in great customer service really if they want to survive and stay around awhile. I do not mind coming back and try their stromboli since I read it is quite good! I wanted to order it but my husband wanted the shrimp sub instead.

However, having said that, it is a tough economy and I'd rather come back with yet another (discounted) Groupon rather than paying full price, but then again, boosting the local business should not hinder me either.

Observing customers this evening, I see a couple or so families. A couple more coming in to order to go, and seem to be a place you just want to eat at cz it ain't crowded and perhaps more of - let's skip cooking tonight and have some pasta night kind-of place.

So, I do recommend this place! It ain't gourmet by all means but a simple and quaint place to go to with alright italian\/pasta and good service.Slowest McDonalds ever. Since they remodeled it's only gotten worse. The wait times I've experienced average around 10min for both drive thru and takeout. If you go inside to order thinking it'll be faster think again. Entire crew needs fired. Very racist against whites.Really good food but it was disgustingly hot out on the patio it was hard to enjoy any food.This place has been around for a very very long time. In fact, when it was first opened by taiwanese, it was so good that all the chains quickly sprawled up everywhere and there's even one downtown on bloor and bathurst. Alas, I don't know what the deal is anymore with regards to all these chains that could be now franchises or simply sold, but  now backyard garden seems to be run by people from china and their chef has definitely changed.  

Their service is awesome.

The staple food items like water cooked beef and fish are still there, among a couple of other spicy offal items and the price is decent. We ordered the water cooked fish, szechuan pepper chili cabbage, stir fried pork with peppers, and cold appetizer of pig stomach. They were all pretty good, but not as good as it used to be so i was a bit disappointed. Still one of the better szechuan joints in the GTA i believe.Best part of my workout is my post workout protein shake at Kiwi Juice Bar! Regina is so friendly and I've tried nearly all their shakes and the are all very yummy! My fav is peanut butter cup with a shot of espresso and glutamine for muscle recovery!! And they have a huge selection of QUEST bars!! Love this placeWent to Pizza Rock with friends.  First impression - this place is really cool.  Live DJ was housed in a restored Peterbilt truck, small booths for couples to enjoy a nice dinner, raised tables along with traditional seating... all around a great look and feel.  But the most impressive thing was the service, quality and variety of food - completely unexpected.  We started with calamari that was both traditional and spicy along with fried artichokes and meatballs...fabulous.  Then the pizza... all I can say is -  OMG - they know how to make pizza - the choices ranged from traditional to "you have got to be kidding me!!"  Under the recommendation of others dining, we were encouraged to try the Mud Pie for dessert.... which we all agreed was the best dessert ever.  If you haven't tried Pizza Rock yet - you are missing out!After reading all the hype when they first appeared here I was expecting to be knocked out, but it was just an average burger. I make 'em at home all the time.This was my first time to a Firehouse Subs before, and they had remarkable customer service. They helped me figure out what I was in the mood for, and the Turkey Bacon Ranch sub was amazing!! Very clean, and a great atmosphere. Thank you Firehouse!!!Neat decor. Friendly service. Great food. Loved the enchiladas and son got the Aztec Fajitas and they looked fantastic!Came because somebody had reviewed and said prices reasonable. Stopped by on a Saturday afternoon. Service was good but draft beers at $6 for 24 oz is a little steep for a neighborhood bar. When I found out at check the owner was nice to come by and  discount the beers to around $5 and gave me a $10 gift card. But I don't live near here and probably won't be back. Nice gesture but wished the beer was cheaper to begin with.  Appeciated the thought. Without the owners gesture this would have been 3 stars given atmosphere is just okay.The waiter and hostess was nice and attentive. I was amazed at their lunch special. The price was affordable and the portion size was huge. I only wished they played music because it was dead silence.This is tale of two ratings: the food and the service

The food was pretty good. I was happy with my salad and I found it filling. I thought they were missing some obvious salad options, like pan seared tuna, but mine was tasty. They did mess up my sisters order, forgetting the chicken which was on the bill. 

The service was horrid. I can't remember another place where I felt that everyone I encountered deserved to be fired. This included the manager, who approached me when I was about to leave, but then assuming I was going to complain, turned and ran to the back. The turning and running was a common theme; I was waiting for one of the cashiers, who turned to me and asked if she could help, but then left leaving me to talk to thin air. The other cashier was no better. He seemed to be playing a game where he would not answer any questions I asked. Soon I stopped talking, which was the easiest way to avoid frustration. It was odd behavior for human beings; even odder for people in service roles. 

My bro in law mentioned a similar experience when he was there several months ago; sadly, it has not improved. So as good as the salads tasted, until there are massive changes, I will not go backWent here while I was on vacation in Vegas. I have allergies so I prefer to go to Chipotle when it isn't to crowded and they are able to change gloves and take precautions. During my five days I was there I tried come in around 3:00pm two different days and the line was out the door. Usually this is the prime time for me to go, but not at this location. Finally I tried going at 11:00am one day and the line was quite a bit shorter. The employees changed gloves and handled my order fine, the only issue I had was my rice was under cooked which was disappointing, because this rarely happens at Chipotle. They also made my bowl relatively small compared to most locations I visit.I've eaten food in several major cities: Detroit, New York, Boston, Wash., DC Metropolitan Area.  By far, this is the best lamb\/beef gyro I've ever eaten!  Per the owner, it's the sauce, I beg to differ.  The combination of the lamb\/beef, chopped tomatoes, thinly sliced onions, the sauce & pita bread marry very well.  You will also get a large order of steak fries.  Everything is cooked when you order so your food is always fresh.  The price is excellent too!  All of this food and a soda for less than $8!Exquisite brunch options and a lovely fine dining experience in the heart of Shaker Heights!
From the moment you walk into Fire for a weekend brunch, it's a white-tablecloth-view-meets-fresh-bread-aroma type of place. I came here with 3 friends to try out the infamous sticky bun and to explore the brunch entrees (see pictures of duck confit, Fire Benedict, and pastrami hash). We were not disappointed, to say the least! Food was absolutely delicious and the perfect proportion to avoid post-brunch food coma. Service was excellent and our waitress was super knowledgeable about the menu and very interactive with our table. Cleanliness of the restaurant is 5\/5. In terms of brunch, the atmosphere is perfect for family get-togethers, dates with your significant other, or even some fancy roommate bonding when the refrigerator is empty. Will be returning to try out the dinner experience at Fire, and looking forward to seeing what this fantastic restaurant has to offer!Here's the thing with Radio Maria - the food is pretty good, as is the wine selection, but the service is consistently off-putting. If you can achieve to find the hostess, she will most likely treat you like an obnoxious pest at best. Service at the table is hit or miss - I've had a couple of decent servers over the two years I've lived in Champaign, but many more ill-mannered ones who seem to regard diners as a nuisance. All in all - this could be an amazing place to spend an evening, but there are many days when the dismal service is reason enough to cut and run.This is a charming little place, has nice atmosphere. I'm glad they are not like other places, where my senses get overwhelmed by loud music and television on every wall. This is a very friendly and relaxing place, I can enjoy my food and company in peace. 

The food is quite delicious with reasonable prices. I love the hummus with mushroom and onion on top. Simply wonderful! They also serve very good sandwiches.The worst place i have ever had the displeasure of going to. My first few trips there resulted in ordering milkshakes with my meal and not getting said milkshakes till the check was already paid for and then reminded them i had indeed ordered milkshakes i paid for and never got. But after a friend said the last time the service was highly adequate i said "hey why not I'll give it another shot.". So there is like 3 adults and two kids and we roll up to the steak n' shake waiting to be seated, after a few minutes or so we had finally gotten someone and they asked the people behind us if they had be waited on. The group behind us pointed to our group and said they were here before us, so waiter said he'll try to find us a table. Now this steak and shake is not super busy but there are a few tables full but our guy is talking to another waiter or whoever and they seem a little rushed and he tells our waiter something and he comes back with, "I'm sorry there is no available tables." and then he proceeds to seat a family of three that just came in. Not even the people before who pointed to us, no wait time or anything just basically tough luck we don't want to serve you. Not sure what we did maybe because they didn't want to deal with kids or something but avoid this place at all costs. If i could vote no stars it wouldn't be one tenths of the disappointment i feel for ever stepping foot in this place.Very popular local restaurant. The food and chips were surprisingly warm and hot. This is a delightful small cafe in a very busy part of town. If you are in a hurry it is nice to have the buffet  as an option.Forget sushi.  Forget teriyaki. Forget ramen.  

Remember the new age of Modern Japanese cuisine.  This is what's happening in Tokyo.  Get a glimpse of it here.

The Kushi oysters are fat and plump.  The shrimp and scallop with butter garlic (this ain't the Keg).  The pork belly - not what you would expect but a welcome change.Great place and terrace. The terrace is beautiful with little lights.  They have lots of choices. The only thing I would recommend is splitting on the boards with the lists of beers the types that would be very helpful. Staff super kind. I recommend that they sit with Wes! Very attentive.I used to eat at this restaurant when it was on Decatur and have always been fond of it.  Now that it's in Sun City Summerlin it's a little pricey for lunch, but the food is good.  The crowd is a lot of seniors so it's not a party place and it's American Mexican food but the food quality, portions, service and drinks are all good.  Friendly ambiance too.Holy spectacular. This pizza is incredible!! I ordered the double crust gangster, California, and bread sticks. My mouth has never been so happy. This is my first of many trips to Danny Boys! The girl answering the phone, and the driver were both very friendly. But the pizza is AMAZINGGGGGG!!!!!!Great place!  We love how the menu changes, and how flexible they are about what is on the menu!  It's like having a personal chef.  Great for lunch, too!This is a new restaurant opened in September and it is known for it's yakitori - grilled meats on skewers. We made reservations for 7:30pm and was seated at a table close to the door. So when ever someone is coming in, we can feel the cold chills. There was lots of different options on the menu, from yakitori to seafood to iron plates to sashimi and ramen. We finally decided what we wanted to eat about 7:45pm and it was the longest wait before we got our first dish. I'm still thinking that because we didn't order any alcohol at our table, our order is put to the bottom. Because the tables around us kept getting plates and we waited 1\/2 hour before we got our first dish - chicken skin yakitori. I can't believe that took 1\/2 hour to make, it took us less than a minute to eat. There was 2 skewers on each plate, 4 of us so we each had 2 bites.

Then we continue to wait and watch other tables get their food. Another 20 minutes later, we got our fried shrimp with mayo and the pork neck yakitori. There wasn't anything special about the fried shrimp, very typical. The pork neck, the meat was bigger piece than what I thought it would be. I only eaten other pork neck meat from Chinese dishes which are in thin slices. The meat was nicely grilled with rice cake in between.

After another 10 minutes, we got our 3rd yakitori - chicken with onion. This was the best yakitori of the night. Very juicy with great flavours. Once we were done, the next dish came - fried chicken wings. This dish was disappointing after an hour wait, it was hot off the fryer but there wasn't much flavour on.

We took our time finishing off the shrimp and wings trying to stall the time for our final dish to come. We asked them when if they forgot the order but they said the chef is making it. After 50 minutes of waiting at 9:36pm, we finally got our takoyaki. The onion flakes on top were not moving at all, a sign that this dish is not hot at all. And when I bite into it, I was right, the octopus ball was cold. It wasn't even close to lukewarm so never mind being hot and steaming. WTF, waited almost an hour for this and what we got was cold??? That is ridiculous. The table next to us got it too and they nearly just sat down 30 mins ago while we waited 2 hours. The other table send it back and want them to reheat but we just got so frustrated and didn't want to wait another hour to get this re-heated. The takoyaki was not impressive, one piece of octopus meat and the rest was dough.

Very very disappointing meal, 2 hours for 6 small dishes to come. We didn't even get anything big, 3 skewers, wings, shrimp and takoyaki. I'm not going to come back here again!I love great service and Palm Restaurant definitely offers that!  The lobster is fantastic and Lobster Fest (the month of August) is a great time to visit.  I love that they are so happy to split everything for those that are sharing.  I do believe that they have THE BEST caesar salad in Las Vegas, oh my!!  The lobster bisque is an incredible way to start your meal and you will probably want to lick the bowl.  Fantastic selection of wines.  The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the lack of fantastic side dishes.  I always expect them to be amazing but the description always makes them sound better than they are.  Skip the side dish and have the caesar salad, lobster bisque and lobster!! That's where it's at.I had the pumpkin crepe and toasted marshmallow latte. Both items were delicious. The crepe was probably the best I've had in Toronto. Will definitely be back.Excellent barbecue. Went for dinner. A little expensive, but it's on the Strip so... Great sliders, pulled pork and chicken. Great ribs, sweet sauce but very good. Great chicken tenders. Good service, nice atmosphere, a little crowded. I will go there again.The chick below(amanda) just order the wrong item that's why it wasn't good. 

I'm Vietnamese and this place is good. The regular soup is good, pho dac biet (special), pho tai, etc. Sate which she order, isn't as great. That's why there's pho dau Bo across the street for that.

Also the Bo kho(beef stew) is good with pho noodles\/egg noodles \/ baguette. Make sure you get extra lemon and a small bowl. Squeeze all the lemon into the bowl and add a lot of black pepper. Dip the beef in that awesome sauce you just made yourself!This was my first time here, my hubby was here before and raved about it to me. This time he said it didn't taste so great and I didn't think it was good at all. I went right before lunch rush it wasn't very busy and the food came quickly. My burrito didn't taste like my meat was seasoned at all and wasn't very big for the price. That would be my only complaint.Stumbled upon this place while driving through South End. Such a fun atmosphere and we loved our waiter Megan!! She took great care of us. I ordered a frozen margarita that ended up being too strong for my taste, and she happily made another one on the rocks that was just right. Great tacos, especially the Baja. We will be back!!I've only gotten delivery from Francisco's, but it's been a great experience all three times. Great chicken enchiladas. I'd definitely recommend this place!Craving some tacos but do not want to stretch out your wallet? Playa Cabana is a perfect choice for you then!

We came here on a Sunday night with a few friends and wow was the restaurant popular. Most of the seats were filled with large groups and couples so definitely try to make a reservation ahead of time if you are coming here with a large group for dinner.

We ordered a variety of tacos and snacks to share and was pretty impressed with the food. My favourite was the Baja Fish tacos - the fish was incredibly light and the taco was super flavourful. The Guacamole was also a great choice for a group to share. 

The space can get quite tight and you probably will end up hearing the conversation of the group next to you. Service was alright sometimes it took a while for us to flag down our server and receive our food. Definitely be careful when walking down the washroom stairs as they can get quite slippery.

Overall if you are in the area and want to satisfy your Mexican cravings, Playa Cabana is a great choice for you.Finally, a cupcake bakery that not only lives up to the hype..they surpass it!  

We've bought cupcakes there on three separate occasions and have tried most of the flavors.  The cake is moist and delicious, but the frosting is the star.  I know there's a lot of "hold the frosting" types out there...I like naked cake myself.  But not here.  Instead of tasting like a sugary blob, Lil' Brown Sugar's frosting is intensely flavored to compliment the cake.  My favs are the strawberry lemonade and the key lime cupcakes.  The frosting is so tangy and delicious, I split the frosting in half horizontally and do the same to the cake..then I have 2 short, but delicious cupcakes all for me.  

The many chocolate offerings are just as good, but chocolate's not my thing, baby. (I know, I know) We got a cpl dozen for a party and everyone raved about the rich, chocolaty goodness while I guarded my Strawberry Lemonade cupcakes like a lioness guards her cubs.

By the way...this shouldn't be an afterthought, but the service there is super friendly and the place is spotless.  Highly recommended!This place use to be so good now it's the worst place. And Chinese cook is very rude. I ask for a medium rare steak I got well done, I paid for 12 ounce I got 8 ounce and when I ask if they can please change it for me the Chinese cook came all the way from the back of the kitchen and he was so rude that I felt like smashing is ugly face. So I walked out of there, paid $48 plus tip$55 no food and very upset. So I'll never go back and I can only tell you to pay your bill after you look at your foodLocation is better but service is OK.  The funky chipotle wings is just some jerk sauce mixed with tangy hot sauce. Neither flavourful nor memorable.

Stick to what you know works for your palate. I ideally prefer a bit of kick and alot of flavour and I have an above average heat tolerance. The menu has too many choices so it's a bit overwhelming for the first time visitor. 

Our waitress was nice but not good with details. The large screens are positioned all over the restaurant but not easy to view from where we were seated. Ambience is okay and the lighting is a bit stark.The best Phillies sandwiches!! If you go there I recommend the Cheese Philly sandwich, it's amazing !!!I think the lobster tasted great! Fries were okay. But the price was too much in my opinion. The size of the lobster roll is about a 6 in. Inside the roll isn't much lobster, but does have tons of bread for $25 each roll. Which we needed 2 so for $50 some thing bucks i feel like we could have got something else much more filling for same price.Called to make a delivery, but they said they don't.
Then why state that you do on Yelp???
Waste of time.I have been here three times so far.  Very good! and I will return.  Being from NY, we are really picky about Italian food in this house.  I have had their large cheese pie..... three times, very good pizza.   Not the best I had but definitely tasty pizza.  I had the brushetta which was really good and I recommend that as well as the pizza.

We got some cookies\/ rainbow cookies to take home.... these were good and I would get them again.   They were not as good as the cookies I used to get in NY but they were still good cookies.

The service at Montesano's is top notch, whether it was Steve, one of the owners or another lady who rang us up, the workers were always super friendly and very nice to me and my kids.  We have only gotten take out orders so far so I do not have anything to say about a dining in experience.The only issue I have with this darn place is the line. I didn't want to ding them for the fact that  hordes of people show up to eat here.

Note to everyone trying to go to Bacchanal around the Christmas weekend: Unless you're willing to wake up early enough to go to brunch, or you show up at noon to get a ticket for dinner, don't even try. When I tried to go to dinner around 5pm Christmas Eve, the system told me the wait was approximately 420 minutes... about SEVEN HOURS. In fact, it told me to check back with the hosts noon the next day. Realizing that I would not be eating there that night, I left. I came back around 8:30am on the 26th, and there was no line for the holiday brunch.

I think I prefer the dinner menu over the brunch menu, and it's worth the extra money. The dinner comes with oysters, which were very high-quality for a buffet. The carving station has more meats available. And the desserts for dinner are 100 times better.

Both the brunch and dinner had crab legs. Yes, I am that person who stalks the crab leg station, and picks out all of the king crab legs, leaving the snow crab legs for the poor schmuck behind me lol.

They have my favorite charcuterie stations for a buffet. I love all of the cheeses and the meats available.

As long as I have the time and money for it, Bacchanal is my go-to for buffets!Had dinner here for my birthday! Amazing customer service. Great seating area. If you like beer this is a great place for you...there's something like 50 beers on tap. Really great food. Manager brought me an ice cream Sunday! Overall great experience.The food and the service was transcendent. The Filet was simply put "one of the best I have ever had".  The atmosphere was a little noisy but easy to overlook.
On a side note;  Based on some of the other reviews I can't help but laugh a little. Reviewing a dining establishment that has steak in the name... for it's fried chicken and desserts is comical at best. And those reviews are as useless as a condom machine at the Vatican.The Arriba Mexican Grill off Bell Road is fantasic, but this location is closer to home so I tried it out.

We sat in the bar area and weren't greeted for about 15-20mins. No big deal, we order our drinks and that takes about another 15 mins to arrive. The server brings drinks to the table next to us and drops the entire tray of drinks and the lady behind me... I'm not talking a little water. The poor lady is covered in drinks. The server immediately apologies and runs off leaving the spilled drinks all over the floor and table. I kid you not that spilled mess sat on the floor for 30 mins before ANYONE came over. No manager came to apologize to the lady right away and all the did was give her a free appetizer! Terrible customer service, the manager addressed the lady as "the one who got drinks spilled on". How about you learn some manners, sir! 

Anyways, after 50 minutes of sitting there we finally see our server again to take our order. The food came and what do you... it's super crappy tasting! I'll take my $50 for 2 people and go else where... like the Bell Rd location. This place sucks, so bad.To be fair, Vietnamese food isn't high on my list of must-haves.  In fact, every time I go there, before I even open my mouth to speak, the staff lets me know whether they have French bread for sandwiches, because I apparently order them all the time  (and didn't realize it till they said so).

Vietnamese food is overweighted towards soup and I'm not a huge soup fan.  I'm especially not a huge fan of this place's soups:  either a clear broth loaded down with noodles or something oily and heavy.  The Mi Xao Don and Mi Xao Men are the closest things to stir fry, but come with either fried noodles or actual noodles instead of rice.  But it makes no difference:  it's watery and heavy on basic vegetables with little real meat.  Most of the other "main" dishes are rice-heavy.  But this isn't the restaurant's fault:  if you know Vietnamese food, then you know Vietnamese food means "rice and ..."  or "soup"  (Pho).

Now, let's go to what this uncultured Westerner DOES like:  

The sandwiches are to DIE for:  simple, sandwich sized French bread stuffed with jalapenos, cucumber, pate, mint and mayo.  Or maybe one with an omelette.  There are a number of different sandwiches and while the two I mention above are my favorite, any of the others will hardly disappoint.  The spring rolls are always fresh and crisp; the egg roll is more like a Chinese "spring roll"  (while the Vietnamese spring roll is nothing like you've had before:  lettuce and shrimp --- or pork --- wrapped in rice paper ... I call them "alien rolls")..  The egg roll usually comes VERY hot, so be careful.  Wrap it up in a lettuce leaf before eating, like the Vietnamese do and find yourself surprised at how well those go together!

As far as beverages go, I can't stress how good their "Thai Tea"s are.  Easily as good as in any Thai place and priced unbeatably low.

In fact, this restaurant has two things going for it:  very low priced, but very authentic food and, of course, being low priced, it's a good value.  When you see that a large percentage of the clientele eating here is Vietnamese, that should be a clue as to what their own people think of the food.

Now, one must have a bit of a strong stomach to eat here.  It's not the cleanest of places; very basic furniture and fixtures, and the tables so close together as to make the dining experience almost communal  (Ho Chi Minh would have been proud of this Socialist experiment in seating).  Kids are frequently here and frequently loud.  Apparently, there's an unwritten rule, that any visit to this Vietnamese restaurant must have children under two in attendance and they must scream or at least throw noodles on the floor.  You've been warned:  don't show up here in a formal gown and leave one star, because you didn't realize you'd be eating in what can best be described as a former electronics store after all its furniture's been repossessed.  And just so you know, that other loud "noise" you hear is the wait staff screaming at each other in Vietnamese like hot dog sellers in a stadium.  Don't worry:  eventually, you'll be too distracted trying to figure out what that food is in front of you to notice it at all.

Overall, despite the negative sounding review, good food if you like Vietnamese; not good at all if you're expecting something similar to Thai or Chinese  (not even close).  Helpful staff  (though one time, I sat for 50 minutes while my partner ate only to be told they forgot I ordered a sandwich).  Dinner for two rarely hits about $25 and we're talking a LOT of food for that.  Cleanliness could be better, but we're not talking about a street stall in downtown Saigon with mopeds racing by.  Oh, and as long as we're on the subject of vehicles:  be prepared for an overcrowded parking lot with unusual parking.  Apparently, some Vietnamese believe that parking in the lines  (or on the street, for that matter) is optional.

Oh, and one other warning:  they tend to close early (8pm) most nights, so don't dilly dally putting on your stockings.  The traffic on I-17 getting there can be murder.Had the Margarita personal small size. Quite tasty, lacked salt. Did uber eats, so was a little cold at delivery. Not super ideal for the price but good enough.Food: Good but most entrees are spicy. Also not too many choices for vegetarians... Prices aren't too bad.

Setting: The decor's tacky to the nth degree. Chandeliers made from beer bottles, plastic vegetables hanging down from the ceiling etc. The place looks like a junk yard... Also they had some mist\/water coming down in their outside seating area. Ladies, if you straighten your hair, don't come here...

Service: Seemed slow for most tables but I did tell the waiter to hurry it up. He brought the food in 9 mins... Yes I timed him. :)Grouchy John isn't very grouchy.  I'm not sure if that should be a complaint or a compliment, but it is a great experience.  I had Grouchy John's at UNLV and not only is it the BEST coffee on campus, but it is also the nicest food truck.   My only complaint is that the coffee sizes aren't big enough for me...BUT,  if you bring your own coffee container they'll hook you up with the right size!I just had dinner here with my family and my in-laws. Excellent. 

Some background.  My wife and her family are from London. My in-laws retired to Cornwall, and my wife and I were actually married in Camelford, Cornwall. We used to hang out at pubs for a pint and to grab a pasty. 

Long story short: my father in law, after dinner tonight said, "These are better than the ones in Cornwall," referring to the pasties here at the Cornish Pasty Company. 

The atmosphere is casual and almost like a pub in the country in Cornwall. 

Can't wait to go back. Great beer on tap selection, too. 

EXCELLENT evening. Thank you.Unfortunately the food was so bland considering the bill came out to 200$. Tried the bone in rib eye had a decent char but very bland no salt or seasoning, filet mignon was the only good dish but lacked any presentation just a chunk of meat on an oversized plate, bbq shrimp appetizer sauce was flavorless, fried oyster were breaded too much and the green pistachio sauce tasted and looked like baby food, the truffle potatoe chips eere drowned in oil, banana pie also tasted plain. Overall lack of love in the cooking and I could find more flavor at a home town buffet. Maybe an off night but the service was good at least until the server realized I had a comp :o went from 100 to 0 real quick lmao. Still tipped 50$Great place for salads...BUT falls short of its parent company Panera. Unlike Panera, Paradise does not offer, nor do they have bread selections with their salads, with the price about the same. Additionally, unlike their parent company Paradise does not offer a pastry at a reduced price (99-cents) when you purchase a salad and drink. Good place to eat, but disappointed if you are thinking about Panera.I wandered in one winter day, after I had been directed to try Loga's Corner. 
Parkdale has a large Tibetan community and they have made use of the area to show off Tibetan cuisine. 
I'm a fan of all of them,each restaurant have their own specialties, quirks and character. 
Loga's Corner is just that, a quirky and special Tibetan dine-in \/ take-out location with, in my opinion, delicious-omnomtastic- momo's. 

I'm a fan. A huge Fan. 
Their momo's are delicious and the hot sauce, is off the hook!

It's a sit in or take-out restaurant. 

Yesterday, I ordered beef, fried beef and chicken (each order comes in 10 pieces), and while I waited for my take out I had a potato ball. Total? $22.60 

A month ago, same thing with mango Lassi - to help counter the spice. They don't win on the Mango Lassi part, but I really wasn't there for that so.... pfft. 

I've also ordered their veggie and their parathas and was lucky to have the paratha's fresh. So, super omnom. nom nom. 

I've eaten here quite a few times since January and I don't plan on stopping soon. 

This is a family run restaurant and the owner's definitely make you feel like your a part of it when you go in and dine, or are waiting for your food.Finally had the chance to try it after avoiding it since it opened due to them not serving the famous afghan Qabuli rice (I just feel always ended up going somewhere where the rice is served instead) 

The place looks great, and the food looks nice too but I found it fell short on flavour and comparing it to other Afghan places it did not meet the same standard.  I think they're trying too hard to appeal to western people.  Also they use black sesame seeds on the bread instead of the traditional nigella seeds which I find rather sad. 

It's rather pricey too, if I may add.Came in starving, left satisfied and still had a lot of food left over. I ordered the orange chicken, egg fried rice, and beef chow mien. SO GOOD  I'm definitely coming back. Their prices are very reasonable for the amount of food you get. Dine in!I really like the recently-renovated Li-Ao, and it is honestly my favourite sushi place in town. While other sushi places may have similar quality, the value is incredibly impressive. So the quality of the food for the price is particularly good. 

Their rolls are the best thing on the menu. I have a particular soft spot for their Dynamite rolls. 

I also appreciate it when a sushi restaurant gives me Pocky sticks after my meal. This is what they always do.Horrid from beginning to the end....Service or rather lack of from the beginning Horrid Apps Horrid. Greasy and tasteless and than the Main Course was even brought burnt........but EXITING the door was rewarding to never look back  if i could rate this at less than a star I would.....I have visited this place twice. I usually have a big appetite and the very first time I have been there I ordered kebabs and it was good but not enough in quantity to satisfy my appetite. I decided to give it a try again before getting an impression I ordered the days special. It was very rich and was beyond expectations. I particularly felt that the food was great but one has to enquire with them before ordering stuff.I love The Palazzo!! ALL the rooms are suites! How awesome is that?!

I stayed here for a couple nights with a big group of friends. We had two connecting suites which made it super convenient. The rooms were huge! I loved the sunken living room with its comfy couches. And there's TVs in every room!

The bathroom was pretty spacious with a tub, glass shower, two sinks, and a little vanity area perfect for getting ready! There was even a flat screen TV in there! I also liked how the toilet was in a separate small room on its own so even if you're using it, other people can still use the rest of the bathroom to get ready. Very convenient. 

The 2nd floor has all the shopping and restaurants. It's also connected to the Venetian which is nice and convenient.

They have one of the best spas and fitness centers in Vegas with even a rock climbing gym. It's pretty expensive though and I would say it's not worth it unless you're a work-out machine who HAS to work out even on vacay. 

All in all, the Palazzo is amazing! Modern, clean, spacious, luxurious. I would definitely stay here again! It's especially perfect for groups! It's also an ideal location since it's located near the middle of the strip. :)relly good place cant find this anymoreWhat has happened to this location?! Awkward  feeling while eating. The manager or assistant manager shouting across the restaurant to the young cashier to clean up the bathroom and not the dishes or the dining room. I stared at her and she seemed to whisper instead. Friday night and the dining room was a mess. Dirty floors and dirty tables, had to ask to get one cleaned. They forgot a topping and was half wash done with my burger before they brought it out with no customers in line. With many other locations, I will probably skip this one.This is our go-to Korean place now. We live nearby and have tried most of the Korean restaurants. The stewed chicken soup is a rare delicacy for a healthful hearty meal. The beef blood spicy soup is amazing for those who are adventurous. The spicy seafood and rice soup is totally rich and delicious. The panchan (the free side dishes) as the freshest we've had on this street. Love Kimchi HouseThanks, Yelpers!
We were a party of five that wandered into the Paris Hotel for dinner Sunday night, found a list of the restaurants there, and used my phone to figure out which was right for us. We had a lovely meal in a beautiful pseudo-French setting (that looked very much like a Parisienne brasserie.  Service was nice; food was good.

Be prepared if you're a pommes frites lover, these frites are more like freshly fried chips. We all liked them a lot, but I've never seen those in France.

If they're serving cold cucumber soup when you're there, get it. Absolutely great!I try my hardest to eat right 6 out of 7 days of the week. On that 7th day, I like to go all out. And by all out, I mean eat everything in site. 

Enter Penn Station. I used to go here all the time in my fat days. All. the. Time. Once I decided to get healthy, I parted ways with this place for over 5 years. Once I learned how to moderate, I decided that I was in the mood for cheesesteak. 

I was happy that there was a location close to where I lived. What I like is that they make everything fresh to order when you order it from the sandwiches to the fries. 

The philly is worth every bit of calories it is jam packed with and the fries are wonderfully seasoned and have the perfect amount of crunch. 

I'm glad I rekindled this romance with penn station. While I do eat right, it's nice to just eat something like what penny station offers once in a whileStayed here for a day back in the Summer of 2007.  Pretty nice rooms and bathroom.  Flatscreen HD TV, nice view of the Luxor outside our window.  Pretty cheap since it's near the end of the strip.  Never been to the pool or the aquarium here, but everyone says it's nice even though you have to pay to check it out, unless you're staying here.Located in the heart of Downtown Phoenix, this busy little coffee shop is sure to please. Drinks ranging from plain black coffee, to lemonade, to alcoholic beverages, Lux has it all. It can get a bit crowded, but I think that's all part of the atmosphere. The only reason I give it four stars is because the service is different on any given day. I've had awesome, friendly baristas before and I've also had sullen, douchey hipster baristas who aren't overly friendly. Service is really important for me. Overall though, I really enjoy the drinks and the food menu.  If you're in the area you should definitely check out this artsy, hipster hangout.I'm not a seafood person at all so I was hesitant to come try this place out; saw here was non seafood choices on the menu so I was willing to try it out. There was 7 in our group and we were seated right away, I'm sure that's going to change quickly because this place is Awesome! 

I got the burger and it was seriously the best burger I have had period. Great flavor no mayo, mustard, ketchup needed. How does a seafood place have the best burger? 

The rest of the party ordered seafood dishes. The fish and chips got a thumbs up from my group. Big pieces of fish that were devoured quickly. 

Husband had crab cake and chowder. The Chowder had salmon in it; he loved it. Crab cake was good sized and had big chunks of crab. 

Two others in the party order the custom blue. You select your choice of fish or seafood;  then how you want it prepared;  your sauce; and 2 side dishes. One had the rockfish and the other had the salmon. Both plates were nearly licked clean. 

Prices are very reasonable. Our total for 7 was just over $100; the most expensive entree out group ordered was $22. 

Staff was very friendly and explained the menu and how items were prepared. The owners were there tonight and stopped by to ask how our meal was. 

The restaurant itself is beautiful; indoor and outdoor seating additionally there's  a large indoor and outdoor bar. 

There are so many choices on the menu you could eat here several times and still have something different; from fish and chips to sushi everyone will find something they like on the menu. 

Overall a wonderful place to have some delicious food even if you don't do seafood. We'll be back for sure.We first encountered Freddy's on a trip to the midwest - somewhere in Kansas as I recall. It is great that Freddy's has made it to North Carolina, because they are some tasty eats. The burger itself reminds you of Smashburger or perhaps Steak and Shake, so if you're not familiar, it's on the thin side. Fries are also thin.

Even better, you can order Frozen Custard - you can get it when you order your burger (ask them to put it "on hold", then you just release it later) or you can get it later, but you'll need to stand in line and order\/pay for it.

The downside to this location of Freddy's is that it can be a bit of a challenge to get to, since it's across from Concord Mills, and turning left in order to get to them can be a challenge, especially at certain hours, but one you're there, it is all good. Also, anything other than a burger may not be ideal - while they have chicken, hot dogs and even a veggie burger, the burgers are definitely the star here.Ordered a pizza for pick up. I came in early to have a beer while I waited at the bar, but they would not let me sit there with my 15 year old son. Apparently a store policy as AZ law allows minors in a bar with a parent.Call ahead for reservations!  We made last minute reservations (it was a Saturday night I think) just in case.  The hostess was so nice on the phone and expecting us when we got there.  

The service was good considering they were a little busy (not swamped, but there were several large parties that night).  

The food was really good and they have a kids' menu so even our little picky eater was able to find something suitable.  

Great place if you need a chill\/casual date night.Reminds me of the tacos I get right across the border in Sonoita. Handmade corn tortillas. Whether you get the carne asada or el pastor, you really can't go wrong. My new to-go place for authentic tacos!Linda and I were there for dinner last night and meal was mediocre. Her steak was so\/so and stringy.
My meal was extremely salty
We were disappointed but service was fine considering how busy they wereI've been to the Pizza Brutta on Monroe St many times and have always enjoyed so when I heard there would be a new one in Middleton, we were very excited.  However, our first visit was a disappointment.

Food - The pizza just didn't seen as good here as on Monroe St.  It was very soggy in the middle and all the topping fell off, don't remember that before.   The amount of mozzarella cheese was skimpy on the Margherita and we also ordered a pizza with the special buffalo cheese and it covered only about 10% of the pizza.  The sausage was very tasty and the tomato sauce was good too.

Price - you know going in to visiting Pizza Brutta that you are paying a premium for the food.  Based on what we ate on this visit we felt like we were overcharged and would have been better off getting a Costco cheese pizza and adding our own fresh toppings like we do from time to time.

Atmosphere - they have done a nice job with the layout of the new restaurant.  The oven is very much front and center for everyone to see and the booth were comfortable.

I have heard from others mixed reviews, perhaps we will give it another try in a few months when we feel like overspending on pizza.Not a bad spot for breakfast and dinner is probably underrated. Just nothing to really put it over the top. Food is OK. Location is nice. A change of pace from the bagels and pastries that are the only other options on this end of state street. Cheap eggs toast and potatoes special on weekdays.The little ceasers that was at this location was so much better.  Pizza slice i ordered was cold\/reheated and not very tasty.

Best new york pizza is secret pizza at the cosmopolitanMy boyfriend and I stopped at this location yesterday for lunch. I ordered the Caprese salad, and he got a large White pizza, with half sausage.
The salad, which was slices of tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, and basil leaves, was alright. The cheese was different from other mozzarella I've had; I don't know if it is because of the free range cows it is suppose to comes from, or if I am use to some other type. It was an alright salad, the tomatoes weren't very tasty, but hey, they're out of season now.
The pizza wasn't great. It wasn't good either, it was just, well, there. Again, the cheese on it was different, it seriously looks like the vegan cheese from Pop Up Pizza, but it's not.  We had garlic and tomatoes on the whole pie, and it was meh. My boyfriend said the sausage was good, but it cost 3$ to add it to the pizza. He had wanted chicken at first, but then saw it was 5$! Every add on for pizza is 2-5! That's outrageous for the quality and quantity that you get!  I really don't know why people think this is the greatest pizza EVER, but maybe we need to go back and try one with sauce. Maybe that's the best part, I don't know, but I really didn't care for it. It was all very bland (you can't taste any garlic on the pizza, and the cheese leaves an aftertaste) and it gets pricey if you want add ons.Waited in line for over 30minutes ... add 15 minutes to that and then tell us they lost our pizza.... how does that happen!!! Then they put a second one in and that one disappears as well. It would not let me process with no stars that's the reason I had to put one star here . New , inexperienced employees .  We are going to pizza Roto in Madison !!Really great gelato, and an overwhelming number of choices- surely everyone could find a flavor that they would like.The Limone was perfect, tart and refreshing. We also enjoyed the Toblerone, which was a deep dark chocolate. Both choices were delicious. Now, was the texture just like the gelato that we've had in Italy? I'd have to say no, but delicious nonetheless!! Definitely worth a stop!Was going to have dinner tonight here. Made reservation at 6pm. Was planning to go to a club after so I wore a crop top and shorts. And they said they had a dress code which I totally understand. But I felt offended because he said something like I can't let you in cuz I need to make sure other guests to feel comfortable. What does this even mean I am not a hooker or what. Maybe I didn't dress properly for such a fancy restaurant. but you don't have to say things like this. This is just not right.Came for dinner with husband and kids. Service was great. I was a bit disappointed that their chips and salsa is chips with two bottles of sauce (red and green). Sauces were yummy, but I like having a bowl of sauce\/salsa to dip. Mexican pizza was delicious as was their rice and beans. Husband ordered the enchiladas suizas and the chicken was a bit dry but still tasty. I ordered the carne asada and what came out was a bone-in steak. Meat was seasoned well but not what I was expecting as I had to cut away much of what was on my plate.The very best lunch specials!  Cashew chicken is our favorite along with the delectable garlic green beans!We happened to be in the area for a sporting tournament and stopped in for a quick, early lunch on a Saturday.  It wasn't too busy yet but it was still before 11:00 am.  Of course, the Barrio Brewing beers were fresh...and cold.  Service was great, as was the food.  The location is impressive.

We came back the following day, Sunday for a late lunch.  The place was way more busy with only a few tables free...there is always the patio option, but it was a little windy that day...we took a table inside.  Again, the food was great! We brought the whole family back on Sunday and everyone was happy and satisfied at the end of the meal.  Even with the busy crowd, service was great.  There are five of us total, when we all go out and I was pleased with the check when it arrived, not too painful at all.

I would highly recommend this place is you are in the area.  Otherwise, the hour drive from Phoenix may discourage you but in my opinion it is worth the extra travel.We stopped in for breakfast before a shopping trip on a Saturday. There was a decent wait but that is to be expected given it was a weekend.  They take your number and text you when your table is ready so you don't have to wait inside.

Once we were seated we were immediately greeted by our server, I believe his name was Willie, he was extremely friendly and on top of everything from refills to extra cream and sugar.

I had a breakfast skillet, the eggs were fluffy and everything was cooked perfectly.  It came with pancakes that were also very good.

It is a little bit out of my way but I would definitely return and highly recommend it.I'm not a big fan of BBQ, but I do love Shane's BBQ sandwiches.  I'm not sure what makes their BBQ so special.  Maybe it's the amount of meat you get.  We usually go there for lunch about once every other week and get the Big Dad sandwich.  The Big Dad is a HUGE mound of shredded pork on two pieces of Texas toast.  The pork shadows the thick toast.  Then you can add whatever sort of BBQ sauce, if any, you want.  Spicy for me, please!  Or hot.  I can't tell the difference between their Spicy and Hot sauce, so I just mix them together.  With the combo I get, I can pick whatever side I want.  I've tried the fries, mac & cheese, and their new fried okra.  All are good, but you get more fries than the others so it can be a better value if you're especially hungry.  

Today I tried their chicken fingers because they had a special of 3 chicken fingers, fries, and a drink of only $5.  Score!   For a place whose specialty is BBQ and not chicken fingers\/wings, their fingers were amazing.  Each one was thick and meaty.  Then they roll them in your choice of sauce.  I got hot, of course, and it was amazing, too.  Wow.  Such flavorful hot sauce!  Now I'm going to have a tough time deciding between their Big Dad and chicken fingers next time we go...

The theming of Shane's is fun, too, (it's supposed to be like a shack) and the service at this particular location is always top-notch.Dirty place. The manager is a pervert. Definitely not worth $15 a sandwich. The atmosphere is not relaxing and the wait for the food is ridiculous. I get better service at my house. I had one of the sandwiches and was literally sick for 2 days. The meat was an odd color. I was really hungry and ate it anyways and I will regret that for the rest of my life. I just hope this will warn people before they they go through the experience I didChicken on the stick with moon sauce is the bomb. Fried wontons are fabulous. Always good to pay for extra moon sauce.La fameuse poutine de la banquise!! Quoi dire: elle est excellente!! The best in town!!I had the lamb gyro here as well as the Turkish coffee, and both were very good, but the service was absolutely atrocious. I might be persuaded to try it again but the reviews seem to be pretty consistent.We decided to order take out last night and wow were we wowed! First, they have a specific take out menu however we really wanted steak from the regular menu which they had no problem accommodating. We both ordered the 8 oz sirloin meal which came with Caesar salad, steamed vegetables, our choice of potato (we both had stuffed), garlic toast, and then the steak of course. The meal was huge! The vegetables were fresh and cooked perfectly, the salad had just the right amount of dressing, and the steak was perfectly medium rare. Even with us picking it up and taking it home 10 minutes away the food was perfect and hot. I would recommend in a heartbeat and we WILL order again! Thank you Matador!3.5 stars for the food.  Came here for lunch before a Reds spring training game in Goodyear - this place is about 3 miles east of the ballpark.  Above average sonoran fare at very modest prices in a two star setting.  Most lunches were $7-$8.  Not completely Americanized with globs of yellow cheese covering everything - but nothing really special, either.  I like the fact that each person in your party is provided their own little cup of salsa to accompany the freebie chips.  The dining area is utilitarian and a bit dim.  Put a buck or two in the juke box - it livens up an otherwise depressing space.

The general area is spotty and would avoid it after dark.  Don't know if someone did not timely show up for their shift - but at 11:30 am on Tuesday there was one completely overwhelmed girl trying to wait\/bus about 10 tables.  We sat unacknowledged for about 15 minutes - and the service did not improve after that.  By 12:15 pm additional help had arrived but the place was basically cleared out by then.

Wish I could give this place a better review as I like low-key local family-run joints - but don't think I will be back.  Side note:  the panderia one block west looked intruiging as did the bakery across the street from the restaurant.My wife and really like this place. Great BBQ!! We lived in Texas for 20 years so sort of know a thing or two about good BBQ.... It is a bit expensive but it's worth it. The cheese macaroni balls are awesome.  Fries are great too. Just an easy and relaxing place to grab some great food.So, this was my first time trying Jimmy John's. I have been meaning to, but I haven't had a chance until now. I ordered the Vito and got my fella the Porker. I really enjoyed the french bread and look forward to trying the Beach Club with the 7 grain bread. I have a good feeling about that. 

The toppings are very simple and fresh. There is a good variety of sandwiches to choose form and two types of bread. They also have delivery which I look forward trying out soon.Best place for breakfast in the Bellagio. The biscuits and gravy are amazing, but do have a pronounced garlic seasoning-great for me.It was a MAGICAL moment when I drove by Harbord and randomly discovered this new location :D

I'm so in love with the 24 hour one uptown... I can't stop raving about it to my friends :D

But the BAD news is that the downtown location isn't as magical :( The Pot Belly with hand-shaved noodles was quite disappointing. The braised pork belly was a bit tough and the noodles, zomg, where do I even start?

Inconsistent thickness... some thick and some were paper thin broken pieces - it was to the point where I can't even pick them up with my chopsticks D: As some yelpers mentioned, the noodles were stacking together (near the end for me)
.
.
.

What saved this review from getting a getting a 2 star.

1. Chives pockets - it was piping hot and flavourful :D Dip it in some vinegar and I was in heaven!
2. Popcorn chicken comes with sweet ketchup mayo dipping sauce
3. Avocado & Coconut milkshake was so creamy and delicious!
4. The Service. The waitress was courteous and gave us good suggestions :)

I REALLY hope the hand-pulled noodles are better or else I will have to travel uptown for my magical cravings :( I will be back again to try more food and update y'all... so hang tight!Don't look for any signage anywhere because there isn't any. If you feel lost, ask the friendly host once you enter the Marben and they will direct you to a set of stairs tucked to one side of the restaurant. Expect to walk into a relaxed cozy bar with people congregated around really well made drinks and hiphop blasting in the background. If you can, sit facing the bar to appreciate the passion and expertise of the bartender as he whips up one drink after another with a level of focus and enthusiasm that I don't even put into my day job. 

If you don't know what to order, just ask the helpful waiters for a quick recommendation or an indepth education session on a particular liquor you haven't heard of before. I found a new love in bourbon after having the Churchill, it tasted like caramel, smoke and a really good dream.This place was on Groupon awhile back ,so I went expecting mediocracy and they did not disappoint!

I went in today for lunch with my coworkers 15 'til noon. Surprisingly we were seated right away, which was a plus in my book. After scanning the menu, I decided to go for the Nachos Florentine. They were... okay, I guess. The clips were cool - spinach tortilla. The tablespoon of grilled chicken was also pretty tasty. The nachos also had spinach, some sort of sauce (maybe Alfredo) and a ton of sun-dried tomatoes. They were okay. With less chips and tomatoes and more chicken, they would've have been pretty decent.

The atmosphere is nice - bar-like. The service was fast and good. I wouldn't jump at the opportunity to revisit this place, but I would go if I were in the neighborhood craving bar food.I don't have a negative thing to say about Daily Dose!

I eat here at least once a month for brunch and have brought friends and family alike, all of whom love it now too. It's biking distance from my house, but so is Snooze and let's just say I have only been there once. 

The staff at Daily Dose is super friendly, quick and even when there is a wait, they provide free (delicious) coffee.

The food is amazing as well, and being as I have Celiac Disease, the fact they offer gluten free pancakes is basically a dream come true!

This has become and will likely stay my go-to brunch spot!Fantastic pizza wings and sandwiches.Large slices of thin ny style pizza.Im a 3 time a week visitor love to watch games on one of the 4 big screen tvs.A pleasure to see a nice family owned business where everyone is super nice.You won't regret.This place is a lovely, interesting place for Pittsburgh. Very good craft cocktails, great wine selection, huge CHEESE selection. Lovely small plates - I especially like the octopus, the salads, the artichokes and sun chokes. 

It does get busy, so you might want to make a reservation on the weekend.Soooo yummy. I'm a huge ramen fan and was very surprised how delicious my ramen was from here ! We came on a Monday 12:30AM (they don't close till 2) and it was busy! We only waited about 15 Mins and got a booth which was nice. Our server was very friendly and explained the menu to us and didn't rush us to order. They also have a noodle refill for under $2 but i didn't need it, I was so full. I will defiantly be coming back next time I'm in town!I am so excited that I finally came here! This is my type of bar- great food, good beer selection, and great company! John the owner is wonderful to talk to and he has a great establishment. I love a good bar that you can sit at with your friends, chat with the bartenders and locals and do some good 'ole fashioned day drinking.

Tip #1: get the poutine! It's so delicious and I didn't want to stop eating it and at $5 why not?!
Tip #2: The draft beer selection is small but good. Order a draft- oh and they are affordable!
Tip #3: They open at 5:30am on the weekdays and serve breakfast all day!
Tip #4: Happy Hour is from 2-7pm M-F and they have some stellar deals!

This is a Cleveland must-stop. I can't wait to go back!Very happy with the most recent visit to Queen Sheba. This is my 3rd visit in the last 3 years and it gets better each time. The service is very friendly and the food is delicious. The owner also stopped by twice to make sure everything was to our liking. 

The combo platter and sambosas were very fresh and had great spice. The tej was also great. Compared to some lackluster service and food at other Ethiopian restaurants in town, Queen Sheba stands out!This is always a great go to place for me and my family, especially it being so close to where they live.

AYCE (and drink sake or budlight sun-wed) with competetive pricing

great selection of rolls food sides and more, the service used to be amazing here, a go to place I would always bring friends and family to...however the last few times I've gone.. it's been over crowded with slow service, or we were given attitude from start to end of the dining experience from our waitress. Used to be regulars, at least dine every month.. but how I'm treated when giving a place business means a lot, time for another place.Good value for breakfast 

The hollandaise for the Benny was mediocre but the fruit salad was fantastic and totally compensated. Coffee included. Great option for a simple brunch.The presentation of the sushi is absolutely beautiful. The Godzilla Roll was delicious!   
We also tried the drink special - Fuzzy Sunshine-so good.  
Great service to go along with all of that too!Waited 25 - 30 mins for 2 burgers and 1 order of fries.  No other orders in front of us. Place was dead. Got the P&L Burger and the Deluxe Burger; cold when we got them and the bun was dry, burger overlooked and the toppings didn't help it.This is one of those cases were maybe my expectations were too high based on a recommendation from a friend. I had the fish tacos and the fish was not tasty and very dry. The tortilla was almost soggy. My wife had the chicken fajitas and deed not fair much better. It just wasn't high quality. While the staff was friendly, they could have been a little more attentive and definitely faster. Overall, I was disappointed but again it might of been because I came expecting great and just got okay.I'm rating this based on food quality only since my dad and I got delivery.

Basically, the pizza is ok. Maybe for a thin crust pizza in the Midwest it's something special, but it really is pretty average compared to any pizza you could get on the east coast. That's not to say it's bad, just that it isn't great.

Also, although the prices for just plain pizzas are alright, the prices for toppings are ludicrous. If you want something like chicken on your pizza it's something like an extra $4! Toppings are usually about $2 or less each so if you want to create your own pizza, be prepared to pay for it.

Overall, I gave Roman Candle 3 stars because of the average quality and the high price that you have to pay for it. If the toppings were cheaper, I would probably give 4 stars.Meh- my reaction to eating at Diego pops last night. The tacos were mediocre at best and quite frankly for the whole "trendy street taco craze" there are so many better places. The actual servers were very on top it, polite and speedy. The food was kind of cold and way over priced. The margarita was strong, but not worth 10$. I probably wouldn't recommend this place...What can I say about Gordon Ramsay? I can tell you if you're coming for a burger you will not be disappointed. The options are endless, and if you're willing to wait 30 minutes or so for your meal you'll be very pleased. My burger was outstanding. The set up the delivery of the presentation or on par. Excellent job. I would've given it five stars if it was just a little bit quicker but the food was so good that again as long as you have the time you're gonna be the supportive whatsoever.I hate to give such a bad review for this place as, the owners are such great people but my latest visit was probably the worst customer service I've ever encountered. The new counter service is horrible. I ordered a beer and waited and waited for someone to delivered even though there was 2 people behind the bar doing absolutely nothing.  Both were just standing there.  Then they both left the bar to chat with people. When I finally received it the server put it in the middle of the table and said " I have no idea who's this is for " and walked away.  Wow. This would of never happened a year ago. Very disappointing.Cool spot to be after work if you're in Mississauga. Atmosphere is cool and casual. Service is kind of slow but friendly. Food was okay.One of my favorite sushi place in Madison, try the sweet shrimp, deep fry the head, it's AMAZING!!!After walking a mile from the front entrance and getting lost through the gambling and shops as I was heading to dine here it was after 10pm when I arrived. There were many empty tables (inside and out), however, I was told that I would have to wait 25 minutes! This restaurant closes at 11:30pm. The servers looked like they should have gone home hours ago. They were dragging and mine never came back to see if everything was alright. It was not worth walking that far to dine there. Eat at another CCF where you don't have to walk a mile both ways.We always look forward to our casual nights out here. Their lemon pepper wings have got to be our favourite wings ever! Beats out wing nights at the local pub every time... hot, juicy, perfect dry rub -- I'm salivating already, and we just returned from a wing feast. 

Also a sizeable selection of mains and appetizers. Their fried rice is always a hit, the pork belly is worth the guilt, and their beef noodle soup is the ultimate comfort food. Had the unagi-don tonight, which was our least favourite item so far. Not a lot of unagi on top of a heck of a lot more rice. Love their bubble tea -- the hot almond milk tea is a go-to choice.

Fun and casual atmosphere. Often gets pretty busy, so be prepared to wait for service at peak times.I was super excited to come here for brunch today!  The reviews had all been great, and there were lots of things I wanted to try!  Unfortunately, I left somewhat disappointed.
After arriving, our server asked if we wanted a starter.  I eagerly ordered the white chocolate and blueberry scones - and was told that the pastry person last night did not prepare enough, so they were only available if one ordered the pastry basket, and not on their own.  Neither of us wanted the chocolate croissant, so no scones for us.  We proceeded to order our meals, a roasted pork omelet and a roasted veggie omelet.  These came with bread - I ordered an English muffin and my friend ordered brioche toast.
My omelet was good, not great, and I asked for salsa to liven it up.  My grind enjoyed her omelet.  We didn't get any butter for the bread, but it was brought when we asked.  When I went to butter my "English muffin", I realized that it was NOT AN ENGLISH MUFFIN!  It was a hamburger bun cut into the size of an English muffin and toasted.  Seriously.  I tried to eat it, but it really wasn't worth it.  When I told our server, he told me that they had a new bread supplier, and it probably was just a different brand.  When he looked at it, he realized that it truly was a hamburger bun.  He apologized, but did not offer anything to correct it.  
We ordered the chicken and waffles next, and those were great - wish we had started lthere.  Overall, an OK experience, but a lot of excuses, no scones, and an awful substitute for an English muffin.  I may return and give it another shot, but for now, I will stick to an occasional business lunch here.Great late night food and great bar to keep on partying, fries are good.  Can't beat being right off the strip especially when everything else is closed.Maybe I'm getting older, but I wasn't sold on Condado Taco. I liked that I had the option to make my own taco, but it felt like something I probably could have done at home too.

It's really loud in here and it makes it super hard to even talk to the person next to you.  I also wasn't a fan of the artwork that included a scantily clad woman with avocados on her top in just the right place to indicate what exactly was underneath. I'm not against that type of artwork but it just felt like they were trying super hard to be, I don't know, cool? So again, maybe I'm just getting too old.

The service, though, was 5 stars.  Our waitress was helpful, friendly, and she seemed to enjoy working there which makes it easier to ask questions when you're new to a restaurant.  Food also comes out rather quickly.

We did go on a Saturday evening when it was crowded and were told they didn't know how long it would take but they would text us.  We went across the street to grab a drink and as we received our drinks, were told our table was ready.  We quickly went back but were informed that because we didn't text back within ten minutes (we arrived in 8 minutes of the text) they had given our table away. So if you do this option, definitely text back or your table will be given to the next party.

I rated a three because I think it's definitely a place you need to try out for yourself.We had a terrible experience at this place.  The service was bad and so was the food. We were a party of four, we didn't order anything complicated,  and we still had to wait while people who were seated AFTER us were getting their food. I had to ask 3 times for a glass of water. We asked for turkey instead of pork sides and had to send back our food because they got our order wrong. Our waitress was not very friendly and was annoyed when we told her the orders were wrong. When she brought back our food the turkey sides were barely cooked. The food was also expensive considering the service and quality.. we would have been better off going to a buffet considering the cost of our bill. We won't be going back.This place is very nice, don't think that if it is budget then the food sucks, it's very delicious. They have happy hours so I managed to buy two big chicken burritos for $14.60 ! Also keep in mind that this place has only about 6 small tables so I think they are mostly take outs.Family had breakfast here a couple days ago for the first time, and it is a nice diner. Perfect for a family, nice name - family restaurant! The food was tasty and well prepared. Our server was friendly and helpful. I would definitely try it for lunch or supper. Just a nice solid diner.I make it a point to have breakfast\/brunch here at least once every time I am out in Vegas.  (Man, it's going to be way easier when I finally move here).  I can sit here and rave about everything on their menu, their service, attentiveness, etc.  But it would take forever.

Food is amazing, service is great.  Decor is definitely a trip, with Big wooden bears watching over you.  They manage to through in a bit of nostalgia as well - the placemats are copies of actual 1950s Vegas news articles.  Don't let the parking lot fool you - i've never had to wait more than 5 minutes for a table.  

Eggs are cooked perfectly.  Chicken fried steak (one of my favorites when I am there) is dead-on.  Burgers are perfect, and HUGE.  I can't say enough.

And for those visiting, and looking for an alternative to the breakfast buffets, and all that crap.  Get in your car, and get over there.  Now.Food is always good and so is service. Barbecue beef ribs, miso cod, and sushi are all great. AC wasn't working last night so it was a bit uncomfortable but no one can forsee mechanical breakdowns, I'm sure this was an exception.Horrible place. We went there for vacation to Las Vegas. Took 30 min to get a drink. Last place in MGM i would recommend going to. Rude.The food is so flavourful and authentic. One of my favourite Thai restaurants in Toronto. Prices are about normal for the area.Came here around 8:15, it was very quiet. I placed my order to go, stood by the side to wait. In less than two minutes the friendly lady who took my order brought my hot and fresh food right to me. I had the small plate of mixed veggies with tofu. I chose the brown rice to go with it and there was a nice size mound of it. I could have done with a few more veggies but it was a pretty good portion for the price (less than $7). I'd like to come back and try out the other dishes!One of my favorite taco places. I got a pork burrito the 1st time I went here and then tacos the 2nd time. The pork burrito is a good portion-sized! And their pork is AMAZING. The tacos are flavorful! And the best part is their $2.50 Taco-of-the-day during happy hour!! I got the chance to try fish tacos and roasted chicken tacos- both delicious and flavorful. The Peking duck taco is super. It has a weird fruity twist to it. And corn on a cob is absolutely mouthwatering.

And to top it all off, the service was great. I mean the 1st time I went, they were busy and it took a long time, and they messed up our order a couple times, but our waiter was so nice and apologetic and gave us several tacos- on the house. The second time I was there, they overcooked the corn (which was still tasty and not burnt at all) and they gave us another corn on a cob for free. 

It's always nice to have that considerate and thoughtful aspect in a restaurant!We made a stop by here before we left vegas. It was insanely crowded that the servers didnt have time to write our name down for the wait. So we decided to togo our food instead. The ramen was more salty than i would like. The noodles weren't as chewy either. My friend got the cha siu bowl and it reminded me of the vietnamese thit kho.I have been here for 30mins and no order has been taking!!this  is not cool at all!! They claim there going to make sure the food rushed out what ever that means but we will see what happens next!

Update the food came out fast hot and was good they gave me 50% off and everything was ok!The service was great we had a older gentlemen I didn't catch his name but he was very helpful and pleasant. The food was pretty good well worth going back a second time we are even planning on bring my sister and her family here. The only thing I didn't like was the fact the young hostess dress top was COMPLETELY see threw. With the men diners that may be great but it is a family friendly and I would not like bring my kids here. It was shocking. When I say see threw I mean I could tell size color and style of bra.driving home from the airport the other day, out of gas, stop to get gas, there's a capriotti's staring at me.

me: "hey, are you hungry? wanna go to capriotti's?"
hubby: "is that where you got that thanksgiving sandwich you brought home the other day?"
me: "YES!"
hubby: "let's go!"
me: "you wanna go to that one (pointing to the one next to the gas station) or one closer to home?"
hubby: "is there one?"
me: "idk. let me check yelp!"

low and behold......there's one within minutes from our house!!!
yes, i should have known this already but i only just recently discovered capriotti's so gimme a break!

it was 15 minutes til closing by the time we arrived but everyone was super nice about it and didn't make us feel rushed nor did anyone show even a hint of impatience or frustration.
this, my friends, is rare in vegas.
i ordered the bobbie...vegetarian, of course.
the hubby had the capastrami.

we were full and happy and plan to go back.......prolly tonight.
=o)Really fun place. My wife got the rootbeer with toasted marshmallow and vanilla. Holy cow, it was delicious. It's a hip place, lots of people there that were on dates, but it also felt fine with our kids there. If I lived in the area, if definitely be coming back to try the rest of their sodas!I love diners! A girlfriend of mine took me here last night .. it was spacious, clean , dainty, .. 

Next time I'll have to try their desserts! They all looked sooo amazing like from a French bakery. 

I wish I would have gotten a picture of their menu that had sooo much food to choose from. From pitas,Italian food, seafood, steak, sandwiches,burgers..etc

I had got a shrimp salad sandwich that came with fries and it was pretty good and pretty cheap, $6.95. 

My friend got the grilled pork chops and she said it was the best grilled pork chops she had.This is a review of the Cigar Lounge:  While offering a decent selection of cigars and a very impressive collection of cognac, Armagnac, and the like, the Cigar Lounge is utterly lacking in vibe and atmosphere.  The upstairs space is small--looking essentially like a converted private dining room--with a small bar at one end and probably five or six "table equivalent" seating areas.  The lounge was largely empty, with just one other group sitting down to enjoy some drinks.  One fellow even came in, was seated, and left after a minute because it was so dead and uncomfortable.  The environment isn't even as posh as one might expect from a Las Vegas Strip cigar and cognac lounge.  The addition of some high-backed leather chairs could probably give it more of "salle privée" feel, but it seems like the space is holding out for some dream of attracting a more raucous, "bottle service" type crowd.  Casa Fuente in the Caesar's mall has a much better atmosphere, albeit in less sophisticated surroundings.

On the upside, the collection of drinks is truly impressive and the display cabinet is worth checking out.  Service is extremely helpful and not at all pretentious: the server was more than happy to make some suggestions to a cognac novice and even recommend some of the value offerings (as it is extremely easy to get lost in some very large numbers on the cognac menu).  The friendly service and impressive drink collection are the only things that save the lounge from a two-star or even one-star review.  The ventilation system is top notch, preventing the room (if it ever did get crowded) from becoming too stuffy.  It actually might be too effective, as you'll likely either feel the air currents or at least see them affecting the smoke from your cigar.I've eaten here as a change of pace from Panthere Verte (next door). Where PV is like a cantine, Crudessence is fine dining. The food truly is amazingly well-prepared and fresh and wonderful (there's also a hot menu if you're not totally down with raw, but really, do try the raw). The only downside is the very steep price tag that comes attached (I once had a $25 lunch here)... Which is probably why you won't see me here too often, except the occasional dinner, but the price does reflect the ingredients in this case.

You gotta try this place even just once.I like the atmosphere in this easy laid back hole in the wall.The food is average but the all you can drink wine helps.Garlic bread is great salad is nice.To me Gordie is the star of this place,Gordie walks from table to table with his accordion asks where your from or why your there and breaks into song,just tip him great entrainment .Keep in mind that Gordie once stood over 6ft tall but carrying around that accordion for over 40 years has caused him to shrink!I would say 5 stars if we're purely just talking about the pizza, but I have to drop it to 3 when you consider customer service as well. After having ordered delivery from Yo Pauly's multiple times, I have concluded that the owner, Pauly, appears to be aggressive and simply rude at times. If you're okay with possibly running into a not-so-friendly environment or lackluster customer service, but AMAZING pizza, this is the place for you. It's a shame Pauly isn't nicer or more helpful because that would easily bump this 3 stars up to a 5. 

P.S. For all those ricotta lovers who don't like giving up the marinara with the typical white pizza, order the "Not So Whitestone Bridge" pizza. It's on their secret menu and TO DIE FOR!Came here for lunch after finishing up some shopping at the mall. Waited only 5 minutes before we were seated and ordered the 2 most popular dishes: shrimp linguine and sausage pappardelle pasta which did not disappoint. The pasta is all made fresh every morning and I was pleasantly surprised to see that small and large portions are available for all pastas. We will definitely be returning, likely with a large group of friends.We stopped by for drinks and dessert on a Saturday night, and it was very busy but we still had decent service. It has typical pub decor and atmosphere, and we were able to watch a basketball game on one of the TVs. It looked like you could enter the pub from a back door entrance as well.

The good: They had Kronenbourg 1664! I was so excited to see my favorite French beer on tap that I ignored any specials they had (rotates nightly with a separate food and drink special).

The meh: The salted caramel chocolate lava cake was good, but not really a lava cake with molten anything inside. It was more like a large moist brownie with salted caramel on top.

Would I recommend this to a friend? Yes, if they're looking for someplace in the downtown area to grab a few drinks and hang out.Located in the Home Depot complex, used to be the Popeyes. 
The food is great, especially the Nevada Burrito (so much better than the Claifornia) which is any meat of your choice, French fries, cheese and guacamole for only around $5. They have all the hot sauces and pickled carrots like Robertos. They do have everyday specials including two types of $1 chicken tacos, one with cheese and and lettuce while the other has onions and cilantro. 
The location is clean, which is different from most Robertos locations. This location does have drive thru and the wait is surprisingly not that long.As a Seattle transplant, the chain restaurants and strip malls of Vegas are KILLING ME. I was cautiously optimistic when a friend told me about Bar + Bistro and I was not disappointed when we checked it out!

We went on a Thursday night and got there in time to take advantage of happy hour in the bar, which went until 7pm. $3 drinks? Yes, please! The atmosphere was cool, but relaxed with minimal attitude. Nice funky\/eclectic decor with little seating clusters for conversation. So Seattle!

Some friends joined us after a while and we sat outside for dinner because it was a lovely, not too hot evening. The server was so helpful and cheery, but not in an annoying way. At our table we had the mac n cheese, crab cakes (they call them something else), chicken nuggets (also with a fancy name), a stuffed pork thing with AWESOME mashed potatoes, and a sandwich that I'm forgetting. All were excellent! The portions seemed a bit small for the price, but not going to Applebee's is freakin' priceless in my book!

I can't wait to go here again. And anytime out of town friends come, this will be where I take them. Love it!O'Grady's is great. The food and drinks and service is much better than across the street at Rainbow Cafe (who don't accept debit). I've been here several times for the 2010 Olympics hockey game Can. vs. USA and it was one of the best experiences of my life, the whole place went wild when we won and we all sang the national anthem and we kept ordering food and pitcher's of beer and the servers and owners and everybody was participating and giving efficient service--it felt like the community had really come together.

I love their wings--they're so tasty! And the beer and drinks are always good. Their patio is right in the heart of the Gay Village and it's a nice place for great conversation. Share the nachos and wings and a pitcher of beer between the friends--fun times abound at O'Grady's. It's always busy and you can eye the cuties if you're single, there's plentiful.

There is also parking down the street that has a flat rate of $7 which isn't bad, especially if you're planning to go clubbing after or explore the Village on foot. Will be back soon!Stopped here for lunch the other day as it was recommended on Blog TO for a good spot to eat with a young one in tow. Upon entering we were welcomed by a bright and cheerful waitress and seated in a booth which is perfect when you have a child with you.

When looking at the menu I found the kids meal section and was disappointed that it said all kids meals come with pop so I asked our waitress if we could sub it for apple juice instead. I was told unfortunately not. Kids meals only include pop and apple juice would be an additional $2. What?!! I find it incredible that they do not allow a child to have juice or milk with the kids meal. I mean isn't encouraging our youth to drink pop a big part of the problem our southern neighbours have? In my opinion the kids meal should just not come with a drink if thats the case. What's the point?

I ordered the Ultimate Mac & Cheese an my hubby got the daily special, Pierogies. I was totally excited about my mac & cheese. On the menu it listed things like 4 different gourmet cheeses, fresh herbs and truffle oil. YUM!! When our food came I was disappointed that all those delicious flavours were over taken by just one cheese. My hubby's Pierogies on the other hand....OMG! It was amazing!! I wish I had ordered that.

Overall I would come back here to give it another try but it would definitely be a kid free visit.Never again!!!! Horrible service as the waitresses brought us the wrong food, and would never hear us trying to get their attention. On top of that they took 20 minutes to get us a can of sprite and the fried rice took way longer than it should have. The blender was being used  right in the middle of the restaurant and was EXTREMELY loud. We won't be returning any time soon....or ever! Don't recommend  Bobby Choas for anyone...For a special treat - this is the place to go.
I always liked to come in just to see what they had that day.
And the breads are delicious!Started a new job in the area. The boss ordered from Jimmie John's for lunch and I've been hooked ever since.

I've ordered the #9 Italian at least a dozen times in the last month, perfect every time. Speedy delivery and very reasonable prices.

Decided to try something different and went with the #10 roast beef and was not disappointed, lots of meat, good cheese.

The bread is not soft and pillowy like most sub places, but hard crusted, french style bread. It is very flavorful with that little hint of yeast aroma you find in fresh baked bread.Horrible service, staff rough around the edges and bad food. A group of four of us went there with very high expectations after reading yelp and left disappointed. It took an hour for us to be seated. Once we finally had a table and ordered, it took nearly an hour for us to be even served. I ordered 35$ lobster tail in wine sauce and it was dry and chewy. My vegetarian friend ordered veggie paella and what she received was literally a plate of rice with like 10 peas....and what really pissed us off is that the restaurants complimentary dish for the table was a plate of paella style rice...basically the same exact thing they charged her 20 bucks for. 

The service was just plain bad. 

The food was overpriced and lame.Outstanding. O U T standing!
We missed it the first time by, but turned around and found it the second time.
Too small for the crowd but the atmosphere was still comfortable.  The food was great and service was prompt.  We had biscuits and gravy and they were very unique! Unlike anything else but still delicious.
The owner was there walking around and talking to everyone while we were there.  He has a huge personality and was a delight to interact with.I've heard of this place for some time and have been meaning to visit.  So glad I had the opportunity to do so.  The thin crust margherita pizza was so dainty I ate the whole thing myself.  The caesar salad had freshly grated soft bits of parmesan cheese -- to perfection.  The gentleman behind the bar was like a host -- very hospitable and friendly.  Yum!What that saying, never let a woman decide whats for lunch?    For me it's not a bad thing, because  if I"m taking one of my best friends out to lunch, and I let her decide...it's usually here.      

Because it's not a date, so I can be a cheap ass bastard, and  jump  on my computer before we head out to this place, because Johnny Mac always has a restaurant.com certificate.

Johnny Mac is a sport bar \/ family restaurant \/ pizza joint rolled up into one, and has been a Henderson institution for the past +20 years, and my friend believe this place makes the best chicken wings and fingers in Las Vegas.     I really can't fight her on this one.   The owners are from Buffalo, NY, and prides themselves on using a fresh and never frozen chicken that soaked overnight in Buttermilk for their family recipe.

Warning:   don't order the viper hot!   you won't be able to taste anything after the first bite.

Yes, there's a bunch of sauces for the chicken, and the mild and watermelon bbq is pretty killer with these fingers.    The Fries are doubled fried, and has a nice snap to them.

Also, I love their Pizza, but tell them to bake it a little longer.    Their sauce is pretty killer, but just remember this pizza can get a little greasy.   So ask for extra napkins   

This place is kind of dark inside, but service is very good, and there a bunch of LCD monitors throughout the establishment.     BTW, this place is a Buffalo Bill hangout during the NFL season, and have pretty good Sunday buffet during game time.

If you're from Buffalo, and getting a little homesick...you might want to check this place out.   One more thing, get a few doughtnut from Friendly (which is a few doors away from them)-- My First Impression -- 

This was my second time eating at Smash Kitchen. The first time experience was terrific. We were there to host a surprise birthday party for my husband. I called Smash 4-5 times to change the guests count and made arrangements to drop off the birthday cake. The manager and the hostess were very helpful. They even arranged a private room for our party without any additional charge. The food and service was awesome! I was hoping to come back after that birthday celebration. When I noticed there was an "Order-the-yelp" event at Smash this year, I was super excited and decided to order their takeout! I called them 15 minutes ahead of time to place my order for the takeout, and I picked up everything on time. 

-- Food and Drink --

*** We only ordered food from the "Order-the-yelp" menu***

1. Main: Finger Licking Rack (Full rack of ribs) - Smash bbq sauce, smashed potatoes, chipotle lime roasted corn) $14 
- The ribs was super tender and the meat just fell off the bone! We loved their barbeque marinate. They used fresh corn instead of frozen corns. Their mash potato was quite bland, I think I should have tried their potato first because the barbeque taste was too strong and overpowered the taste of the rest of the dish. Overall, I enjoyed their ribs a lot! 

2. Burger:  Yelp's Angry Smash Burger (Burger) - Double patty, cheddar cheese, onion chips, lettuce, pickles, smash sauce $7.50
- The burger was huge! I couldn't bite the burger in one bite. :( Love the quantity and quality. It also came with a side (salad\/ fries\/ daily soup). We picked the soup of the day, which was the Southern Pulled Pork Soup. The soup was very hearty. It had a strong spicy, sour and sweet taste. There were a lot of pull pork in the soup, and again they used fresh corn in the soup! I couldn't be more pleased to try their soup and burger :)

-- Overall --

I loved Smash Kitchen! The food was great (4.5\/5.0) and their service was exceptional! Can't wait to come back to try their brunch! :)Who doesn't love the Fountains at the Bellagio? It's one of the best FREE shows you'll see on the entire strip. And, it's a show that works around your shedule. It begins every 15 minutes so you can see it at 6pm on the way to dinner or at midnight once you've had a few cocktails and you're walking barefoot because your heels hurt so bad. 

Whatever the case, the Fountains at the Bellagio is another must see in Vegas!Pretty outrageous behavior by a completely unaware management team.
If I make a reservation and am more than 15 minutes late- they would cancel my reservation. Yet, I show up on time and am told the management has absolutely no idea when a party of 3 can be seated 

Bye and good riddance 

Last time we were here- the service was exceptionally slow as was the delivery of the food. Almost an hour 

The place makes good food- the service and the way it's run are not worth it.

December 16- One final footnote- I wrote an email to the General Manager detailing the problems above. 
He ignored the email
With friends like this- who needs enemas?
Buh Bye- St Francis!

GM contacted me and apologized. So- that's good. Post script to review. They went up one star because of that. He also invited us back. Thinking about that.
Good food\/ questionable service :-)Our second time here.  We were anxious to find out about waiting time from the hostess. Our first experience was too lengthy.  She assured us that given the sparse amount of customers we should be ok.  We opted for a table by the window but within minutes we were  baking and we were blinded by the sun.  The restaurant lacks efficient sunscreens.  We quickly moved to a center table.  It was still too bright.  They really need to address this issue especially now that summer is around the corner.  We got their mozzarella cheese appetizers as starter.  It tasted average and was too oily. We then order a thin crust pizza, 1\/2 sausage 1\/2 vegetarian.  Ron liked the sausage topping, l liked my garlic spinach topping. We, however, didn't care for the "thin crust". It wasn't thin, it was medium thick and stiff, lacked flavor too.  The cardboard effect was on, it didn't meet our expectations.  Because the crust was so stiff,  toppings were sliding off the crust. Staff is pleasant, busy and on top of things.  Unfortunately  there won't be a third time for us. We'll wait for the upcoming restaurant across the street  opening up this summer.Chicken teryaki bowl was not appetizing! Veggies and rice were mushy and the chicken was rubbery! Really wasnt flavorful at all! The soup was tasty though.everything is overpriced. the food takes forever every time and the servers are understaffed.We came on an average busy Sunday and were seated around 1. After ordering around 110 we finally got our food at 2. We pointed out to our waitress that the wait for the food was long and she seemed shocked that we said something, and told us the wait was normal. The food was mediocre compared to other PF changs and even getting our bill and food boxed seemed to take forever. I think a simple apology would've gone a long way..Stopped by Matt's when I was visiting from out of town and it's a solid breakfast place. 

There was a long line though because it was a Saturday, but wasn't anything unbearable. I had the cheese omelette and hash brown and the portions are h u g e. The top of the hash brown was nice and crunchy (and really good after you add a little more salt and ketchup) but the inside was a little soggier than I would like and I think it's because it's so thick. The omelette was really good - not too much cheese - but needed a little salt and pepper for more flavor.Authentic Texas BBQ.  Brisket, pulled pork, turkey and the beans is what we order every time we come. We alway hit up Rudys when ever we are in this part of Chandler. Breakfast tacos are amazing if you come in the morning.I love this location! The waitresses are always so warm and welcoming. It's a casual, laid back place that's great if you wanna eat some good food and enjoy a couple of cold beers. I definitely would recommend itWe make a trip to Vegas every year and Red Square is always on our list of where to eat. Their signature vodka martini is my favorite especially with the blue cheese stuffed olives. If you like vodka, this is the place to visit. We've never had a bad meal here and for starters, the smoked salmon cold pizza is wonderfully different and delicious.....think lox on a thin crispy crust with capers and drizzled with fresh lemon. It can be pretty loud at happy hour, but by around 8 pm is quiets down some and you can enjoy a romantic dinner at a leisurely pace in a unique setting.I had high expectations for Latitude 40 when it first opened, but I was very let down upon my first visit. 

A group of friends and I went to watch a Penguin game on a Saturday afternoon. The atmosphere was fun for a game, the drink special was decent ($2 Miller Lite drafts), our waitress was friendly, but the food was terrible and overpriced.

We ordered Nachos, the appetizer sampler platter, and chicken fingers. The nachos were nothing special-- chips, cheese, jalapenos, sour cream, and scallions. The appetizer platter had buffalo chicken dip, onion rings, and 10 wings-- not worth the $20. The chicken fingers were the best thing we ordered, but really how can you mess up frozen chicken fingers?! Our food took over an hour from the time we ordered.I'm only part-time vegetarian, but I like that this place exists.  Especially if my vegan friends want to go out.  I didn't care for the avocado fries (tasted like peanut butter, yuck) but the grilled cheese sandwich made with tomato and avocado on sprouted bread was pretty tasty, albeit kinda small.  My friend's raw vegan tacos weren't as good as what she makes at home, but the avocado veggie burger was a hit with her boyfriend.  One complaint is that blue corn chips come with the sandwich, or you can pay an extra 50 or 75 cents for kettle potato chips?  Kind of a rip-off; don't they both come in big bags and we get a tiny pinch on our plates?  The sodas are cheap, and the cafe seating is comfortable.   I hear you can rent that space for $25, which is not bad for a central venue.Super fresh and amazingly delicious! Awesome sushi chefs and great customer service! Can't wait to try out the rest of the menu!Jupiter's is a great place for any crowd of people. This place is great for kids because they have games they can play in exchange for tickets and then prices. They also have about 8 pool tables where you can enjoy a few games. 

Their pizza is very good. They're famous for their thing sliced pizza. They have an unlimited selection of toppings and sauces. They also run great deals like half price large pizzas on Tuesdays. 

My only complaint about this place is the speed of service. I've been one time when the waiter forgot to put one of our pizzas in, which made us wait even longer for food. But they did make it up by buying our entire table a round of drinks.We arrived at Oliver's on Friday evening around 5PM, just as they were opening for dinner.  The atmosphere was modern and elegant, the kind of place you go for a festive evening meal.  We were greeted warmly by our server.  He was helpful during the whole meal, but we never felt any hovering.  We ordered drinks, and when they arrived, we ordered the beet salad, the buckwheat crepes, and the Cornish hen.  Service was prompt, and we found all the food beautifully presented and delicious.  The beet salad was especially yummy, with a variety of beets and greens in a sweet vinaigrette.  The crepes were tasty and unique with a squash purée and roasted brussel sprouts.  It sounds odd, but tasted very good.  We shared everything, including the hen.  The half bird was sitting on what tasted like a large potato pancake.  We found the bird about what one would expect considering the portion size, price, and quality of the entree.  
  As we finished off the meal by sharing the bread pudding (reminded us both of a thick French Toast with a serving of sorbet), the bar area started to fill up.  A couple even sat down there with their newborn.  The clientele was a mix of young folks looking for a drink after work, and couples looking for an elegant meal.  This is a place we will keep in mind for future special occasions out.Went here for 4th of July buffet. The first plate of food was warm and not hot .The chicken was cold ! Then to my disbelieve my second time up to the buffet I see ants all over the chicken I just ate! And crawling all over the buffet! I hand the plates to the waitress and I leave.Just hoping I don't come down with something from eating the very cold chicken that was sitting next to the hot chicken!We had a family dinner here and it was very good.  Good atmosphere (a touch loud for my Dad).   Excellent, prompt, professional service.   Food was good, large portions.  I recommend.i live for taco tuesdays and this is my new go to! the happy hour is all day long (monday-thursday) so you not only get $2 delicious tacos you can get a $2 draft or a $3 marg, and the white queso is to die for. 10\/10 take all my money pleaseJust had breakfast here today and am already planning my next trip back. Bam! The decor is very interesting and allows a lot of natural light into the place, which I always love. Staff was immediately friendly and happily answered any questions we had. I had some egg strata thing that was pretty amazing, but my friend had a meal that was better than mine! Damn it! Don't you hate when you try your friend's food and you wish you had ordered that instead? Bastard! He had some pita thing with sausage (sorry I suck at remembering meal names) and it was soo damn tasty. I loved the seasoned potatoes on the side as well. I do not drink coffee, but according to my friend his iced vanilla latte was amazing. We finished our meal off with their blueberry coffee cake. Pretty good! Slightly dry, but my mom's a baker so I'm biased ;) (yeah Ugly Cakes!). They are VERY decently priced with no meals over $9! Great little spot, can't wait to try the other menu items.Saw a review on fry bread. Saw that it was a outdoor basic place with incredible fry bread. All is true. Super nice people. Best fry bread ever. Things you should know. Open Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday. From around 11:00 until after lunch. Bring cash. Need to eat in car or take with you. Really basic maybe 6 items and soda. Closed if raining hard since not much of a cover over the kitchen. I can not wait until Monday to go back.This place just doesn't do it for me.  The food isn't bad, but it's definitely forgettable.  I just don't like being there, either.I got a bubble tea here. I really didn't like it. The flavor was not what I expected. I had hoped it would taste like tea, but it was mostly milk and I really disliked the tapioca globs. Everything on the menu was expensive and most of it was stuff I had never heard of. I like to keep an open mind and try new things, but this was not a good one. I won't be going back.I seen Bebo's around been didn't have a chance to try until now.. Took the cousins to the Amaize Maze Farm for them to do the corn maze. But realized some didn't eat.. so for the kids, we opted for the good ole classic Mac and cheese. Very creamy and definitely a hit. Then the adult had the Mac and cheese with steak and bacon.. creamy and overly savory. I didn't care for the bbq sauce. Taste like one of the sauce I have in my frig with a tint of A1 Steak sauce added to it. 
All in all. Bebo's is a good comfort food. The type of food where you eat, have a beer, sit in front of a campfire and chill. Not the food you eat and run around in the corn maze. The kids all gased out pretty quick!What a tasty addition to our melting "Pot" of flavors in the city! The Egyptian cuisine prepared by lovely Chef Iman is unique and delicious. And, she and her staff are so hospitable! One stop and I'm hooked! Don't miss the Koshari and a Tahini shake...mmmmReally fun experience... great with a group.  Watch sports while you wait, they have all the games on.  Suggest you make a reservation.My first time here, been hearing a lot of great things about this place and my BF's daughter wanted to go since she went last year. The place was packed but of course it was a Sunday around 100pm. So waited for about 25 min for our table which you really don't mind because they have a store that you can shop till your hearts content. They have a row of rocking chairs in the front of the restaurant so you can also just relax if you want about (20) to choose from, food was ok it's just seemed like an overpriced Denny's but your there for the ambiance and experience, in the shops they have giant dumdums to bottled root beer definitely a plus. Don't have them in Ca so experienced it and that's enough for meNot sure why everyone is complaining about lines, just grab a set of presales and you'll be ok even if you don't know the promoters. I could see this place being amazing if I was still in my early twenties but there's only so much house music a person can take before it gets repetitive. 

That said Hakk is a great venue, lose a star due to the smallish dance floor in the main room (this is definitely a vegas thing). Tables and private booths are fun but chasing off bottle vultures can be a chore sometimes. Biggest Protip? Cash tip or grease your security guard and hostess BEFORE they come out with your bottle from prompt and attentive service.

Not sure if i'll go back again since i've already seen the entire 2015 roster that I care about (Hardwell, Harris, Tiesto, Nervo) but it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world if there was a return.When I came into this restaurant I was a little underwhelmed. The tables are wobbly, the place was crammed and they serve water in a plastic cup. However, all these impressions were shoved aside when the bags of delicious mess came along and the real fun starts. I guess I walked in not expecting anything but it was very fun eating with your hands. The meal is extremely messy and you'll soon see a mountain of carcass pile up in front of you with fragrant garlic chilly oil leaking out of the bags of whatever they serve you. 

The Cajun fries is a must get, it was extremely crunchy and fried to perfection. Dip it in the sauce that came with the shrimp\/lobster\/snow crab that you may have ordered. The quality of the ingredient is not shabby. The mussels are surprisingly fat, the shrimps taste juicy and fresh and the lobster was yummy. Did I mention the Cajun fries ? In addition we ordered a bowl of rice. We rolled it into a ball and dipped in the sauce. That was fun and tasty as well. 

Overall I enjoyed my experience there. The fun factor is certainly worth noting. Aside from the positives there are some downs. They are a little strict about the "whole party must be present" rule. We were only missing 2 but couldn't get 6 people seated. The place could use some work. It feels like they bought yard tables and stools. Very flimsy. The downs are apparent but the yummy food and experience makes up for the flaws.This is a really great barbecue place! Omg!! Im sooo in love with the Pluckin' & Cluckin!  They serve this pulled chicken sandwich the best topped with their homemade coleslaw!!I read others talk about this being a "tiny" place and was assuming it would be small. It's smaller than small. It's about the size of the last 4 rows of a school bus. You cannot have a table for 4 here. There are two tables total that might squeeze 3, plus maybe 4-5 seats at a counter. That being said, the woman who runs this literally does everything! That's both good and bad. The bad is that she's swamped between taking orders, cooking, answering the phone, and who knows how cleanup and dishwashing is done.... It's like someone's mom in a small kitchen with limited supplies. But she gets it done!! Amazing. 

The food is ok, not great. Considering its in Cecil maybe I should say it's great. But frankly I was hoping for something better. I love Korean food and have been spoiled by some awesome Korean places, regrettably none in Pittsburgh. The Korean pancake was a huge starter and even though we ordered it with hot peppers it was a little bland. My Buldak Chicken was listed on the menu as fiery and  "not for the faint of heart" but It was probably only a 6 on the heat scale but fairly tasty. My wife's Daeji bulgogi looked almost identical despite being a pork dish. The color was indeed, as someone else pointed out, like that of fiery Cheetos. Somewhat off putting. Must be the same sauce cause the dishes tasted almost the same. 

All in all, pretty good food and very reasonably priced. Not worth the drive for me. Also not a place I'd want to wait to get into. Go off peak or call for takeout.I had an upsetting carry-out visit just now, having to hear the manager lose her temper with an employee (presumably new), who seemed to be learning how to work the register. This kind of belittling behaviour is inexcusable; a manager should teach, not belittle, *especially* not embarrass an employee in front of a customer. I do not want to think this kind of treatment is a typical thing for those who have the apparent misfortune of working under her.Excellent food, service and ambience! Totally hit the spot. Great spot in Montreal for an amazing meal. Started with the grilled calamari. It was divine. The grilled chicken and vegetables were succulent. The truffle mashed potatoes are to die for... Lemon Martinis are on point. I understand why it is #1 on Yelp!I always order delivery and have never been physically into this restaurant. But I love them. Their raviolis are my FAVORITE. Their pasta is to die for. It stays hot till it gets to my house too, their delivery containers are great. They have amazing food I just love them. I wish they hadn't changed their cannolis! Amazing place. Amazing food.GPL is EXACTLY what I've been WAITING FOR to hit Las Vegas. This is "hipster heaven". The co-owner\/server (John Anthony) is warm, personable, attentive, and quick on his feet. Every restaurant in Las Vegas should have a dude like John running things. He's everything the dining industry needs.

What we had: 
a slice of cheese pizza  $2.50
1\/2 cheese steak sandwich (with shoestring fries)  $7.49
1\/2 B.L.T. (with shoestring fries)  $6.99
2 Mango Teas  $4
1 Ninkasi Lux Lager (beer) (John recommended)  $5
Total w\/ tax = $27.68

The food was great, no complaints. The fries were better than McDonald's and in the same style... only without all the chemical additives. The 1\/2 sandwiches are large enough that you' think they were WHOLE. So skimping here. The pizza was good too. Not too greasy.

My wife loved her B.L.T.. The beer was on point. There are a lot of activities and things that go on here so it's cool to stay tuned in.I wouldn't have know it was there except my wife and kids had seen and heard of it online. In an endcap in an awkward spot. That being said is appeared busy even though it was late. We were the last in line before they closed (drive through). We thought they might not serve us..lol..since they closed while we were waiting. They didn't and once we got our sodas and cookies it was GREAT! I'm really starting to like the little sodas shops...maybe it's because my brains really starting to kick out some dopamine from all the sugar. Great little spot.We come to Phoenix about three times s year, and we never miss a great Italian dinner at Michelina's. Family owned and great food.Okay, so its probably unfair for me to review cartel.  I went there to pick up beans.  It was pretty clear that the beans I was buying weren't roasted recently.  (They told me they were about to roast.)  But, I was desperate.  In all fairness, the beans smelled awesome. Yet, the taste didn't get close to the smell---not delicate at all---much more grocery store like.  I will go back and try when their beans are fresh.

Atmosphere looked great.  I was more than slightly (ehmmm) insulted when they suggested that I was dropping off my kid for college.  Last I checked, I wasn't nearly of that age group.Apple pancakes were awesome! Disappointed in the swedish pancakes but quality of food was definitely worth the trip.imidiate seating hostess was great waitress was over loaded ordered fried chicken which was recommended was told two sides came with meal found out when the second side was not received that sides were extra almost $5 for fries the chicken was hot over cooked seemed like it was reheated very dry second piece was better but still dry very dark like it was refried ask by waitress about food told her the complaint nothing was done full charges for substandard food nice atmosphere terrible food I'm guessing they are counting on no repeat business because of busy airport environment highly recommend A&W if your looking for chicken its way better just down the concourseMy favorite burger spot , From Alexandria VA to Montreal QC....great service, fast and on point!Bistro was closed due to remodeling when I went. We ordered the fried chicken and tteokboki. Super good! Very fresh and presentation was nice. The music was fun as well so it made it an enjoyable experience. Definitely want to go back to try the bulgogi and sweet potato\/bacon pizza. My friend from Korea says it's the closest thing to real Korean food she's had so far so definitely try it out! It's remodeling but go to the karaoke side to order the food!Every review is 100% correct. 

This is the best BBQ I've ever had. Period. 

Pulled pork is insane. With or without bbq sauce it is delicious. It's so good I might say it's better plain. 

Brisket is out of this world!!! The crust is pure salty greasy crispy goodness. My mouth is watering writing this

Smoked turkey. Holy crap!  Unbelievable. Better than Mom's Thanksgiving turkey. Way better!  

This place knows how to use salt and smoke and low temperature and time to make the most tender - fall apart - mouthwatering - role your eyes back - meat possible. 

Little hole in the wall spot with a long line but super super worth it. 

They are even really good at catering. 

Make it happen.I have gone here at least once a week, for the past 4 months, mostly 2 times a week. I always recommend this restaurant, even to complete strangers. The food  is amazing. No matter what you order, you will not be disappointed. My absolute favorite are the french fries. I have never liked french fries before this. The service is great. Jacqueline, Alysa, Alex, and Payton, are great servers. The owner will do  above and beyond to make her customers happy.I was sat at the back booth of Nori right by the bug zappers (in the kitchen doorway) and was eaten ALIVE by mosquitos. Within 15 minutes of sitting there we noticed a SWARM of mosquitoes (which are disease carrying if you didn't know) and when we mentioned the swarm to our server he admitted that this is a permanent continual problem and that they "have to leave the front doors open in order to attract business" into their mosquito filled restaurant. The server then pointed out a large permanently installed bug zapper adjacent to our table and kitchen door. When I advised management to not seat people at the SAME table UNDER the SWARM, she smirked and gave a perfunctory apology and sent us on our way not even offering to comp the bill we already paid (with cash so we could run as fast as we could to a restaurant without a bug problem) NASTY.Definitely will be back!! 

Vegan,  vegetarian and Raw options Finally!!!! 

We had the Veggie burger with out the bun and tofu fries. 

I am a fan that all calories are posted with each meal or ingredient. 

Locations all around the city.Cute little place tucked away at the back of the parking lot. They have really made improvements to the interior so it looks a bit more updated. The food is always good. I happen to like the prices here a lot you get a good helping of food and you don't end up paying through the nose for it.

Over all a great place to sit and eat a meal. They are never super busy so food always comes out hot and fresh. Nice amount of space and booths that are closed in making it a more private dining experience. Staff can be a bit slow to fill water \/ refill a beverage. You have to catch them when they are bringing your food other wise you probably won't see them again till you leave.My favorite Middle Eastern food in Phoenix.  Chicken kabobs are the best!My boyfriend and I went here for happy hour and dinner before a play on Friday night. I love that they are underground. It does add a romantic feel to the place. 

We started with a couple of oyster shots and stuffed baked clams in the bar. The oysters and clams are $1.50 each during HH and the stuffed baked clams were $1.75 each. The stuffed clams were large and yummy. The shooters were good too but they came with a lot of sauce. They have a cute bar so I can see myself coming here for HH again. My one complaint is that I ordered the stuffed clams when we were in the bar having drinks and they were taking quite some time. While we were waiting the hostess came and got us because our table was ready and told us that they would bring the clams when they were ready to our table. Well we were seated, ordered and got our salads and still no stuffed clams (which I paid for at the bar, they made sure I closed out before I was seated). We notified our waitress and she said that no one had told her anything. She checked and then came back and said they had put in a wrong order and they were just baking. I understand places make mistakes but once someone has been waiting at least 25-30 minutes for something that should have taken 10 at the max, then comp the item or offer a comped dessert. We got neither. 

Anyway dinner was good. Their salad had a bit too much of the vinaigrette. I had the stuffed lobster and it was a lot of food. My boyfriend had the petite fillet and said it was cooked perfectly but lacked flavor. I'd still give this place another try.the best steak ever ( drop the mic)..........................so yelp won't let me post just my comment so I typed this part so I could post my reviewWent for dinner during the week , open late so decided to try it out, it's located near broad acre swapmeet , super good food I ordered the octopus shrimp ala diabla comes with rice salad and fries, I must say one of the best ala diabla I have had and the horchata was so refreshing. I also really enjoyed the chips and salsa that they give everyone . I will surely be coming back againLike most Chinese joints, this place is the cheapest during lunch.  I appreciate a good lunch special and I know that those specials aren't the authentic Chinese cuisine dishes of the Far East, rather the Americanized versions that we have all come to know and love.  They do it all right here and I am always pleased with the service and quality here.

Craving chow mein, Mongolian beef, sweet and sour, and fried rice?  This is your place.This is a Subway type of restaurant so it's "assembly line " food but it doesn't taste like it!
Our pizza was delicious and came out quickly -- and the price is great.
We will be back!This place is elusive. It looks like a little hole in the wall and if not for being told about it I probably would have kept driving right by, but these guys deserve some love.

Something like a hundred different bottled soft drinks plus diner style burgers and fries, sandwiches, floats (with bottled drinks if you like) and SLUSH PUPPIES does anyone else remember those?

This place is awesome. They also have a 10% off check in deal so there's no excuse not to try it.

Order a "Rocket" style (triple meat on a sub roll) and split it with someone. Get 5 bottled drinks and get the 6th free.
Oh, and their cheese curds? Just like the state fair.

Wish they had a bigger location, but it looks like they are expanding to the suite next door, so that's good!Short and sweet: the food is really good, but it's not worth the money. You're mostly paying for the novelty and celeb chef restaurant experience. 

Extensive wine list, sommelier on site, but prepare your checkbook for the wines. Almost all wines are three or four figure prices. You can find a bottle or two for around $70-80 though. I like to share two or three bottles per dinner so that I can start the night with a buzz as opposed to the feeling you get after a coma-inducing meal (re: "the itis"), but my budget only allowed for one bottle which was nursed slowly over four courses. The itis ensued. 

You can order off of a tapas-style small plate menu or opt for Giada's menu which she offers her house guests. We did Giada's menu which included a shareable antipasti plate, a tiny pasta plate (can be a let-down if you're a big pasta lover like me!), an entrée (I did the rack of lamb- amazing), and three mini-desserrts per guest. The cost of this tasting menu is $120\/person.

The service, although not bad, did not not match the price. Nothing special about the service, our waitress wasn't extraordinary like the bill. I'm sure this varies server-to-server though. 

Important note about how you like your steak cooked: my date ordered the beef tenderloin for her entrée, cooked medium-rare. She is not one to send back food, but at this price, you might as well make sure it's right. The steak was rare in our books (red center). She sent it back and they cooked the same steak longer, but not long enough to cook it more. It was simply warmer, the color didn't change. Hesitating and trying not to be an ass, she sent it back again, and they agreed to cook a whole new steak. Third time's a charm: it came medium-rare (to our standards: warm pink center). There seems to be varying definitions of steak done-ness, but what happened with my date can be avoided by communicating to the server exactly how you would like your steak to look. I'm pretty surprised they didn't start a new steak the first time she sent it back and that they didn't cook it enough to add more color. 

Would I go back? Yes, but only if I'm rich enough that dropping $1000+ for two ain't no thang. So, no, I wouldn't. (We paid around $500 after tip, and I really wanted more wine. Maybe tapas is the way to go instead.)Wow. Worst pad Thai ever. I always say eat what ever the name on the restaurant says. So I had Thai.  This place is more of a Chinese place but I won't be eating here again I check it out.  Cheap prices, but that probably explains a lot. 

Located in a corner plaza behind a 7\/11.Elegant resto, attention to detail is impeccable. Serving staff is top notch, attentive and classy. The food was amazing. Was there with a group of professional IT people and we were treated with white glove service. The menu was fix, so I did not get a change to explore a lot, however what I was served was "Cordon Bleu" grade. It's shameful that The Michelin critics do not travel to Canada, because this would be a two star if not three star Michelin rating. I will be back with my love, and we will explore all avenues of their menu...

Started with the Romaine Salad, served with Red Fife croutons, Thunder Oak Gouda, and house Creamy Garlic Dressing. 

For the main, I selected the Clodhammer Steak, with Charred Asparagus, in a Smoked Soubise Puree, accompanied with Chimichurri Potato Salad.

The Wine was delish, did not get a chance to grab the name. 

For dolce, I selected the Lemon Tart!

Tout était parfait!I love this place!!!! Made reservations and we were seated right away. The staff is very pleasant as soon as you get into the restaurant your greeted with smiles. It's a huge place with lots of open seating. We came during happy hour which was awesome. We ordered sliders and hot wings which were very good for the price. All and all a great experience!Nice place for a variety of Japanese pub\/snack food. Karage was tasty as was the baby octopus In wasabi. Sushi was fresh and pieces were of good size. Yakitori specials began at 6pm ((but I was out by 5:30).Very tasty vegetarian buffet. The only complaint I have is that there were two TVs on the whole time plating two different news stations. Why?Made a reservation and still had an hour wait. Ended up leaving because too crowded and music was way too loud. Will not come back.OH MY G**! TINI TUESDAYS ROCK! I love the loud music and the foods good. Their brunch on sundays is great too. They have drinks specials all the time and I love that.It's not better than Asian Choi at Beachwood. They have more selections but really it's not the best thing in the world. Their egg rolls are crispy and have been cooked too long, their spring rolls are mushy as well. The chicken teriyaki is pretty good. Overall tho, it's just a regular placeWe went there for brunch this past Saturday, and we thoroughly enjoyed the food.  There was a good selection of food, pastries, fruits, etc.  

The pastry selection was to die for.  We had a chocolate croissant, almond croissant, pistachio coffee cake and cookies.  They were all wonderful.  

The tables are nicely spaced out and there are plenty of booth seatings for larger parties.

Brunch was $23.95\/person (I believe) and breakfast is $13.95\/person.  Not too bad.

Our server was a little slow, but not too bad. 

We will definitely be back when we want another buffet.Amazing food, amazing staff, and a clean and pristine place. Staff are very outgoing and always ready to offer a new type of food for you to try. Their motto "We are Different" is really brought to life through their food and exceptional service. Definitely worth trying.Been here many times over the years. I love it. Great soup, servings, service is quick and good for the most part. They only got it messed up once or twice and they fixed it.So sad. I was excited to grab a drink and it wasn't good at all. There was only one worker(who was very kind) however they're under staffed. I got 3 kids size smoothies and the total came up to $15. All three smoothies tasted very bland, it tasted like it was blended\/crushed ice with ONE piece of fruit just to say they actually put fruit in it. :\/ i wanna give them another shot but everyone else's bad review makes me not want to.I was excited to learn that this restaurant had an extensive vegetarian menu but after trying the food was utterly disgusted and disappointed. I ordered the peanut sesame noodle dish. The noodles were overcooked and terribly soggy, the peanut sauce was a brownish-tan thick pudding consistency that looked and tasted like garbage. I was so hungry I really tried to eat it but after a few bites I felt an overwhelming feeling that I needed to stop because the food was sickening. 
 My boyfriend had the same experience with his zen trio rice dish. It was a combination of faux chicken, beef and shrimp that looked like it could be a children's toy; steamed and covered with an inedible sauce that left us full of very low quality food and feeling sick. 
 I appreciate them trying to accommodate vegetarians but if you are a vegetarian do not be fooled. The food is such poor quality and horribly prepared you would be better off eating McDonalds.Such great service and food!

We were visiting Pittsburgh for a few days and staying in Monroeville.  Decided we wanted Thai food on a Thursday evening and checked out the options on Yelp.  Selected Boris' Thai restaurant and drove about 20 minutes to get there.

Pulled up and we were immediately seated.  Waiter was super friendly and we had a nice discussion with him about Thai culture and food.  We ordered our dishes and were also given complimentary Thai iced teas which were delicious.  We both ordered curries and were very happy with the taste and presentation.  

Would highly recommend and will eat here again given the opportunity.My experience with this place is based on a delivery order from Orderit.ca and upon seeing the executive specials on Yelp, I think next time I will just swing by for a pick-up instead because I think the prices of their delivery services is inflated compared to their dine-in prices.  It also took 1 hour for the delivery to arrive and I was getting worried whether the food would come at all because I placed the order quite late at 10pm.

We ordered the butter chicken, vegetable korma and eggplant dish and a few sides.  I really liked everything, especially the vegetable korma.  The reason for the 3 stars is because my vegetarian friend found a piece of the butter chicken in the eggplant dish and that's a huge no-no.  There should never be meat found in dishes that are deemed vegetarian, that's not cool.  Upon seeing that this place is a buffet, it kind of makes sense that maybe the person spooning the dishes into the take-out containers got a little tired and was careless, but it is still unacceptable.I finally made my first visit to a Perkins and I was very pleasantly surprised. 

While I normally like to opt for local restaurants. Perkins is the opposite, being a well established diner chain, like unto IHOP or Denny's. 

I would say the biggest departures from Perkin's counterparts were, tables that were not sticky, good service, and the ability to make substitutions without upcharges.

This place is a solid, perfectly adequate, 3 star joint. I would totally come back.Pretty disappointed that they don't give ranch with wings any more.  They wanted to charge 60 cents per container...not sure if this is a new or temporary policy... Either way, it sucksCame in for a non chain cup of coffee. I was not disappointed. We were greeted by the friendly ladies behind the counter. They helped recommend the breakfast sand which that was very delicious and home made. Coffee was smooth. Glad we stopped by.The dining area is very clean, spacious, and beautiful! The service is great and positive. The design and layout is perfect as it provides ample space to move around the buffet. The food is amazing.Excellent food and service! Even better beer selection!! Awesome craft beer choices and no bud light in sight :-) This has quickly become one of my favorite new beer spots and restaurants in general. Go now!This is one of the best wing spots I've been to. The traditional medium wings (my go-to) are AMAZING. There's so much flavor and they're just spicy enough without being overwhelming. I always order them extra crispy and they always deliver. My wings are always spicy and crunchy, just how I like them. Must try!I've been coming here off and on since 2001.  No frills, and the decor and overall environment is outdated - but the food is consistently yummy.  Not the best around, but I can always count on having my taste buds satisfied at this place.  The prices are quite reasonable, and the staff is friendly (although a little difficult to understand at times due to a language barrier).  Try the sticky rice and Thai iced tea or coffee for an extra treat.Très heureux avec ma récente visite au Coup Monté. J'étais de passage a Repentigny pour voir ma famille et mes parents ont suggeré de visiter Le Coup Monté. 

Je dois dire que j'ai adoré de pouvoir apporter mon propre vin et la formule table d'hôte. Cette dernière a un prix qui varie selon les éléments que vous commandez.

Culinairement parlant, l'experience était merveilleuse. Les ingredients étaient bien balancés et les plats classiques comportaient des éléments nouveaux et surprenants. Mention spéciale au bacon avec le dessert. 

Les prix sont très raisonnables pour la qualité des mets servis. Le service était très amiable mais il serait encore meilleur dans de petits détails, comme fournir une serviette avec le bac a glaçe pour essuyer la bouteille et venir remplir les verres lorsque nécessaire. 

Autrement, un excellent restaurant.Waited 30 minutes for my food. This is not a fast food place!!  This place sucks I'll never come back to this placeIt's late lunch, but we,still paid the same price. Half the tables are full, but its ten minutes between servers. This one went to the bar, like all the others have. So my food is luke warm not hot. You should refuse sitting near salad bar.  The service is much worse than I remember.  The food is good but  anything special.

The choices and service are far better elsewhere. The restaurant most be in that profit stage where they have built a clientele and expect repeat business.  This isn't what they were last visit a year agoWe went for latenight happy hour. It started at 9. Half price on select apps and alcohol. Andy was our bartender and he was fabulous! Very friendly and we look forward to coming back to his great service!Date Night at Cajun Queen was delectable!  My husband had the shrimp 'n grits and I enjoyed the étouffée! We were running 5 mins behind, but we were still seated within 5 minutes of our arrival.  Highly recommend for date night!  If you're looking for the live jazz atmosphere, be sure to request this when making your reservation.  Thanks, Fernando!  Your service was just right.tried veggie chowmein .. chicken manchurian & pepper chicken appetizer .
Very good 
New placeThis is a great place to meet and eat. Love the Santa Fe omlet or Corned Beef Hash. Servers are usually very friendly and my meals have always been served quickly and hot.When I came to this place it had a unusual smell, it wasn't pleasant.  I put up with it because my friend wanted to try shabu shabu.  The waitress did not do a good job explaining how the place worked and just pointed at pictures. When she gave us the pot she gave me the wrong broth, she gave me the spicy miso which I said I did not want spicy. And she forgot my sea food combo order which I had to request for near the end of my meal. When we went to pay for the meal, she made it very complicated adding a tip in the meal because we were paying with two cards, I told her I would just tip with cash to make it easier.  My friend was in the bathroom when she brought over the iPad to sign and she insisted for me to sign for him. When we got home I noticed they added an additional 15 dollar tip for themselves.

Do not go to this place if you want to try mediocre shabu shabu, or get RIPPED OFF!Avec celui du Bellagio, le buffet de la Wicked Spoon au Cosmopolitan fait certainement partie des meilleurs buffets des casinos de Las Vegas.

Pour 20$ par adulte a midi (soit 5 de moins qu'au Bellagio) , vous profiterez a volonté de salades originales et variées, de poissons et de viandes parfois découpées sous vos yeux, de patisseries délicieuses et d'un bar à glaces époustouflant

Le cadre est agréable et au gout du jour; on apprécie la présentation en petites cassolettes qui évite de céder à la tentation du "goinfrage".

Par ailleurs, le prix inclut pour les adultes un cocktail "mimosa" (champagne + jus d'orange), qui est payant au Bellagio.

Seul bemols : des viandes rouges et des sushis en peu en retrait, qui coutent selon moi a la Wicked Spoon sa cinquieme étoileAre you SERIOUS ?!?

I'm stunned at how many people actually like this dive. I've eaten Chinese food all over the city (and all over the world) and this place consistently ranks among the worst. Mongolian Beef? Try Mongolian Mystery Meat. All of the supposedly beef menu items that I've tried have been tough and stringy, I dread to think what kind of meat it really is. 

The spring rolls have the texture of  dried cardboard. Moist cardboard would be an improvement.    

My sister loves this place for some unknown reason and as a result I'm often dragged here for birthdays, anniversaries and other celebrations. After 8 visits, I've started eating before I go to this restaurant and when I arrive I'll have a beer and nibble on whatever looks sort of safe.   

I'm willing to concede that it's just me. Perhaps I'm a snob and I'm the only one who's bothered that the pan fried dumplings are soggy and the place just doesn't seem to be that clean.  After all, it's fairly packed when ever I've been there. Lots of Chinese customers... that's supposed to indicate good food, right? 

Despite the audience of loyal followers, I'm not even remotely impressed. And don't get me wrong, I'm not going here expecting Pei Wei of PF Changs, I'm looking for authentic Chinese, sans Jogging Cow. My advice: Look elsewhere.This is one of the few places I try to make a point of visiting every time I'm visiting my parents.  It was one of my favorite haunts in high school and continues to rank high on my list of favorite restaurants.  The service is always great, I've never had to wait for a table, and I love the food.

About five years ago, my favorite appetizer here was the rice rolls, spring rolls stuffed with rice and shredded carrots instead of the standard cabbage mixture.  I'm still hoping they'll make an appearance again someday.  Until then, I love the fresh spring rolls.  The sauce is sweet but not too much so, and I like starting off what is bound to be an enormous meal with something light.  I also recommend starting your meal off with a Thai iced tea.

I believe I've had every vegetarian entree except for a few that contain peanut sauce, and I enjoy them all.  The woon sen pad thai is a good twist on the standard, but the curries really stand out in my mind.  They are all delicious and different..  The Thai Place also offers a few desserts - fried ice cream and mangoes with sticky rice amongst them.

Overall, I think this is a gem and definitely worth visiting.  As a vegetarian with food allergies (probably a chef's nightmare), I really appreciate the service, the care, and the fact that I have never in six years had to send an entree back or even look twice before I dig in.

PS: If you are a crappy parallel parker like I am, park in the garage on Bellefonte and walk over.  It is always cheap and gives you a chance to burn off a few extra calories during the walk.This is my first visit here since the remodel on this particular Wendy's, and what a design decor upgrade they gave this location. Bravo. I remember how rundown and so very plain the old store was. The design of this store is even different than other Wendy's throughout the valley that have been remodeled. I love how the owners designed this location in such a square way. It is so perfect. 

The employees are some of the most upbeat and attentive staff that I have ever seen. They ensure that all the guest needs are met and it is performed with such personalized perfection. I ended of ordering the 4 for 4 menu with a jr bacon as my burger choice. Also salad was on the menu for me and enjoyed a Caesar salad and a Cobb salad that I split up between myself and the twins. I would revisit this store just to be in the company of such competent and courteous staff.I ordered a taco salad here thinking it would taste your traditional taco salad. It was over priced and was basically just romaine lettuce with chicken mango salsa and cheese. I guess you can't go to a place that's famous for their fish tacos and fish entrees and get a salad.Not exactly the best place to come for a burger and fries...my burger was dry, tasteless, it had the texture of cardboard...and the fries were soggy, and almost burnt, I would not be surprised if they were reheated...Lafleur for me is a one-time thing...been there...never coming back.Stopped here on our way out of Vegas. We were looking for a tasty breakfast spot and we definitely found it. The portions were generous, the coffee was just right, and the flavors were spot on (with the exception of the potatoes- they were great at first but as the meal went on the saltiness took over. I will say our server was exceptional, she was attentive without being pushy and was genuinely pleasant. I would recommend this place for a good homey meal away from the strip.Usually when I go for pho it's a normal experience but this was a little above average. Not enough for me to give them 4 stars but still not a bad place. A couple of my friends brought me here. The decor seemed really modern, contemporary - nice. 

After being seated, it took a while for the pho to get to the table but wow was the portion HUGE.

The noodles, the beef, everything tasted great and in addition to that, it wasn't expensive at all! Service wasn't great, the servers did not keep tabs on us at all and just hung around, which is why they don't get the 4 stars but when I say a little above average, the food tasted better than other places I've tried. 

If you're in the mood for pho and are nearby yonge and Steeles, give this place a try!

3\/5This place is really expensive. I know it's a steakhouse, but is it ok to use the term "meat-heavy"? I had a little bit of everyone's plate, and i definitely feel that the meat was lacking something. for my main dish I had the duck, which was good, but more on the greasy side. The cherries definitely help bring out the taste in the duck. However, i don't think I would come back here again. Not worth the money.I've been to this Hooters at least 5x and I don't like the wings, but I don't like wings so what do I know. 

I always come with a large group and they all enjoy the heck out of it. They're very accommodating if you plan in advance or one the spot as well. They also take great lengths to make gluten free wings and non seasoned fries. Which the curly fries are rather nice. 

I tried my luck with a Tom Collins and although it tastes quite sour, maybe too much lemon or the club soda, it has the proper alcohol ratio and garnish. No one everrr gets the garnish right, most people think it's a lime but it's orange and cherry, so well done. 

Tried the key lime pie, my fav, and it tasted a little staticy like a refrigerator if that makes sense so I won't order again but I ate it...well half of it 

Finally after yrs they did the birthday song I've longed to hear and the women were great. Very funny. Normally I get a better than you, vapid vibe from the competitors waitresses but they were fun to talk to and didn't seem "down" on me. 

Only problem I have with them in general is my several rejected applications despite sales, marketing, hosting and bar tending experience and my friends telling me I have great hooters, it was implied to me I should apply without curly hair... Do you ever see particularly dark or curly ladies? Wish I did.I always eat at the Kaizen on Paradise but today I tried this location for the first time and I'm very delighted. I love that that they have all you can eat option and still have all of my favorites available. I definitely will be coming back with my sweetheart.If there were a six star I could give only once in my life, it would be this little Hongkong style place called sugar sweet cafe. This was located only one block from where my wife\/love of life used to live. We squeezed together in a tiny room to save money on rent, and we couldn't really affrod any fancy restaurants. However, this little place with delicious and generous food at great price, brought us so much happiness. We usually went there after all day of work, and I would order my all time favorite which is the baked spaghetti with tomato sauce and fried pork chop, and she usually like to have Singapore style rice noodle. They also served us tasty milk tea as an appetizer and soup at end. We enjoyed every single moment there and we always laughed together, held hands and talked about dreams. It doesn't matter how much money I can make for her in future or how big of a house I could afford for her. She is the sweetest girl in my life, and looking at her smiling face made me realize what my real dream was. If I could spend the rest of my life, holding her hands and bring her to this little cozy cafe, that would make me the happiest man in my life. She is just this type of an angel that is happy for such little things, and never asks for more. 
Now four years have past, I have been more successful in my career with much more earnings. However, my love of life is no longer with me. I have made terrrible, terrible mistakes that broke her heart. I look at my bank account and those big numbers don't bring me any moment of happiness. I wish I could go back to the time with her when we only had 20 dollars in the pocket but we could enjoy a happy meal together. I know life has no regrets and there is no way back. People make mistakes and learn from the pain. I only wish the best for her now, and if miracle could come true, I would hold her hand so tightly and never let it go. 
Thank you, sugar sweet cafe, for serving us such delicious and generous meals with friendly price. And more importantly, for providing me this place of love and unforgettable memories!The brothers don't mess around here. Pho is all about the broth and they slow simmer for hours to extract the full complement complement of flavors and aromatics.

So you got the foundation covered

Now add Farm fresh vegetables as the toppings and you are almost there

Enjoy the beef tendon and the real deal is sitting in front of you

They also offer complimentary jasmine tea

I love their Khao Soi special and creamy bowl

Enjoy the large and crispy rolls as an appetizer with a nice side of mango and pepper cubed slaw

For the rivers at the table they have many crispy rice dishes to enjoy

These guys rock and it's a family favouriteEva is a great server. Breakfast was delicious! I had a bacon avocado omelet with half an avocado on top! Completed their survey and got 2 muffins to go. Try it.Another Chinese buffet taken over Country or Hometown Buffets. I heard good reviews about this place.  $12.99 per adult was reasonable price, food selections were good, and they even have a BBQ and noodle station for wonton noodle soup, beef stew soup, seafood noodle soup, roast duck noodle soup.  If you go to a Chinese restaurant and order three of these soups, that would cost you more than $12.99.  I'm always afraid of eating sushi at a buffet place.  They are never fresh and probably sitting there for hours. I was impressed with the Calirolls.  They actually have fresh avocados on top.  The deep fried rolls were probably fried a few times. It was tough, not crunchy at all.  If you're a fan of seafood, there are plenty of different seafood dishes to select from.  Speaking of buffets, my brother had mentioned Todai buffet.  I sure missed that place in the valley.  They have so much more to offer.This place definitely gets 5 stars. At first glance it looks shabby and like an abandoned building (if thats anyway to explain it), but when you walk in, it looks like a country kitchen. Great atmosphere and yummy southern food, this place is perfect for lunch or dinner. I definitely recommend trying their chicken gizzards on kabobs. They are AMAZING. Every dish is served with a boiled egg, which puts spin on the dish. I work in the area, so its perfect.This is my new favorite !!!  Ahaaaaaa. Place to stop by !!!!! Food is quick , such good appetizers to pick from , vast array of specialty drinks, wines, beers of all kind ... No not as many as BevMo... But fantastic atmosphere !!!!just finished eating the rolled eggplant.  pretty good.  had to be heated up and has some ricotta in between the rolls.  it was a good lunch and it's so affordable here.  i'm sold on lab's!  i may have to start picking up lunch meats here as well.....As soon as we arrived to the hostess , a patron was coming out and warned us that the food was terrible,,,but we wanted to make the judgement on our own, after all it looked like a good, cozy place to have a meal and a cocktail. The service was good, but....... the food was mediocre at best, the bread was burnt, the linguini with clams was way too salty,,,,yes, yes we were warned about that as if that is the way its supposed to taste....it  but it sounded more like an excuse for a botched dish. Way too expensive for the type of food served. I will never go back.I can't help but see all these bad reviews and realize that most of them are irritated people, and everyone has bad days, but you can't take it out on the restaraunt. I came here on August 21st, and even tho it was busy, the food was honestly amazing. Maybe not 100% authentic, but 100% tasty. Definitely worth a shot. I ordered the pork burrito and the trash can nachos along with an awesome Cadillac margarita. Don't trust all the reviews. This place was off the chain in the taste scale. Whoo!!We came here for the game and had a blast. Our server was patient and great with our big crowd. It was overwhelming for me to pick out a beer so I just told the server what I was in the mood for and he came back with the perfect selection. We had the mac and cheese, pretzel, wings and we initially wanted the ham and cheese sandwich but they said they were discontinuing that so they subbed in turkey. Pretty standard bar food, not great but not bad at all. 

Would definitely go back here for another game as they have tv's everywhere.It definitely looks more pleasing than your average fast food place. But then again, paying eight to nine dollars for fast food is kind of expensive.

I'm thinking you can get more food at a cheaper price with comparable atmosphere somewhere else. Who knows. Maybe I'm a cheapskate.

AND THEY RAN OUT OF NAPKINS at lunch time. That's a first for a fast food place...First of all the marinara sauce brought me back to the taste of authentic New York City now I am from New Jersey so I know what's an Italian hotdog from Dicky Dee's in Newark, NJ. Overall the Italian Hot Dog was spot on except of the potatoes, I was expecting cut up fried potatoes like from NJ instead it was fried potato chips that's my only issue. Next time we will try the pasta here! Service here was okay kinda a let down with the cashier being uninterested.The beef sate soup is perfect. Just the right amount of spice and a hint of lemongrass.Sushi Neko is definitely the most favorite AYCE sushi for me and most of my friends in town. I really enjoy coming here. Their food was so good. I have never been disappointed by this sushi so far. We have always had good times here. Their Nigiri are the best in town since they were all made with small portion of rice and big pieces of topping. They also have tons of appetizer for you to try. Never miss one!!! They are all good. I recommend the shit and dynamite.  I would give them 10 stars only if I could. Joy and Han are my most fav servers. Their service were very good. I cannot go elsewhere since there would be no other sushi place to beat this one up.This is the best Portuguese chicken in the city. I would highly recommend it to anyone! The staff is friendly with fast service. Super delicious!!!!!!!

The interior of the restaurant is nice and new - they have multiple big screen tvs should you want to dine in.

They do only accept cash so make sure to bring some - if not, there is an atm next door and inside.I would give it a 3.5 but not sure how to make that happen. 
Atmosphere is a 5 star, Service a 4.5 Star, The Wine Server that night was awesome. 
The food for the High end pricing it demands was a 3 star. The food flavor did not match the price expectations! Steve Wynn himself would be disappointed. 

We sat by the door that leads to the restroom and it was slamming way to loud, they finally just left it open. Back right corner. 

My NY steak was just normal, My wife's Lobster Risotto was good. 
The Meatball app. was just weird, no flavor, The mixture of olives, parma, peppers etc was very nice. 

Wine prices are Extremely high, but a great selection.Great food at good prices, incredibly fast service even when busy, welcoming atmosphere, definitely recommend.If the show "Cheers" was ever a restaurant, it would be Persuasian. Even if you're not a regular, Joey, May, Chi and everyone else there will make you feel welcomed and makes you want to come back. 

I only been here for lunch, but they are in my weekly rotation... heavily. They have a mix of Chinese, Thai, & Vietnamese dishes on the menu. So you can be basic and get the basic Chinese dishes like fried rice, general chicken, sesame chicken, lo mein noodles etc. But don't be basic, try the other dishes they offer, since they also have Pad Thai noodles or pick a protein and get that stir fried in a Thai basil sauce. Or try out their Vietnamese pho with your pick of beef, chicken, tofu or shrimp. Honestly whatever way you go, you really can't go wrong..... hmmm, honestly, I got a confession. I've become basic myself while coming here for almost 2 years for lunch. I did try most of the lunch dishes and my go to is either beef pho on cold wet days like today. Or it's the chicken in spicy garlic sauce. I need to take off these uggs, trash my Starbucks, and throw down my scarf. The next time I come here, I will switch it up and try something new. So if you're in the dilworth\/south end area stop by Persuasian for the food and stay for the conversation. I highly doubt you'll be disappointed.Terrible. Used to be the diamond in the rough every year up until this yearly trip. 

They reduced the cost of dinner to 28 dollars but the food selection is now half of what it used to be

Also, at the start of dinner at around 530pm one would expect fresh food, but most of it had the 4 hour under a dry heat lamp look to it.

Asked our server why the food looked stale and he said it shouldn't.. Ill pass it along to the manager *rollseyes*

Lastly food quality dramatically dropped. Save your money and goto McDonald's instead for better food qualityBest service I've had in Phoenix in a while. Fernando was friendly and very hospitable. There's a $4.99 Thursday lunch special - Chicken Chimichanga. I got it with red sauce, rice and beans.  yass!! Not spicy (I love spicy though), good texture; could be a little crispier, but still a great value. My Corona ($5.25) was served with a perfectly frosted mug and wedge of lime. I was greeted promptly and checked up on periodically. The chips served with bean dip and salsa was fantastic. I'll definitely come back to try more things on the menu.I have been many smoke houses and tried many different ribs.  This by far is one of the best, if not the best.  Pittsburgh's best ribs by far.  They have many medals indicating so as well.  These delicious, succulent ribs fall off the bone.  The Bbq sauce was excellent. Very excellent quality meat and not fatty.  I ordered the full rack.  The full rack is prolly enough for two average eaters.  A half rack filled me up which allowed excellent left overs.  The fries were very good as well. My wife had the half chicken.  It tasted good and was moist.  Only drawback was it was all dark meat.  All their meat is smoked and cooked right outside their restaurant.  Be prepared to eat outside.   Eve though you are outside there was no issue with flies or birds disrupting your meal.  Very well kept and clean. 

By far the best BBQ in Pittsburgh.  I definitely will stop by every time I come back to Pittsburgh.  I only wish they could ship them back home.This place is great. I give it four stars because I feel the price is about 10% too high. I would come more. I know the preparation and product they use it higher end. 

Pistachio is amazing. Sounds odd, but try it. You really can't go wrong with the choices here.

I tend to go weekdays during the lunch and stuff comes out very quickly. I am thinking 10 minutes for a pizza.

I am disappointed they also shrank their desert offerings. Loved me that cheesecake.On September 21,2018 at about 7:130pm while dining here there was a roach crawling across my table while I was eating. The waiter noticed the roach and pushed it in the ground. I called for the manager and asked the waiter to stick around to explain to the manager that we both saw the roach crawling on the table while I was eating shrimp and crabs. The manager and a a younger Asian waitress explained that they have plenty of roaches and they try their best to spray them but the roaches continue come. They only offered to move my seat. So eat here if you don't mind dining with cockroaches.I normally don't go to Starbucks because I do feel that it is overpriced, but my wife and I had some time to grab a drink before we had to be somewhere. I got the mocha frappuccino while my wife got the caramel. They were very good, but as other reviews have said, the sitting area is very small.Excellent combination of sushi and burritos. Tastes very delicious. Definitely will come back again.Beautiful, romantic place.  My wife and I had dinner last night and were given a cozy booth with pillows.   My wife had the white bean hummus appetizer and I had the crab cakes and both were exemplary.  She had the vegan entrée and asked to have some red chili on it and the chef graciously complied.  She had had this dish before and she said it was even better with "a little kick".  I had the pan seared scallops and the were cooked perfectly.  

I have been here numerous times and could never tire of this gem of a place.  Everything was impeccable, from the service right down to the romantic music.  We left very happy and will be back.I have passed this place so many times, and thought it sounded gross. But I went there yesterday and LOVED it. The waffles were good. And the Red Velvet cake was so amazing. Definitely one of my favorite red velvet cakes. 


I haven't tried any chicken, but I bet it's good.Good service but terrible food experience ...... We ordered the turkey burger, shrimp spring rolls, plan waffle with butter and syrup, and chicken tenders and French fries.... We sent back everything but the chicken tenders and French fries (and that was off the kids menu)!!!!!! The waffle was over cooked, the vegi burger was gross and the shrimp wasn't cooked in the spring rolls! And at the end we asked the serve where to go to get the good food she said Omgoodness what did you order? We told her and she said "yea those are bad choice" at least she was honest and knew what we ordered was disgusting!!Ok sushi at best. Prices are pretty average so that's a plus. The service was very good and the sushi chef was very courteous. I would go back... and I did and it was horrible. Changed my original review from three stars to two starsStopped in for a quick lunch.  Far exceeded my expectations.  The portions are huge, the seasonings are distinct and flavorful and everything is fresh!

Definitely a stop when I am in the area.I always love to get a fancy cup of coffee whenever I'm in Las Vegas. There is usually one fancy coffee shop at each one of the resorts. There are actually very few that I have not tried, at this point. When I saw Va Bene, I was very excited to try the coffee there in the next day. When I approached the register, the lady was very confused by my questions. I couldn't tell if it was a cultural difference because she was not American, or if she was just being rude. It put a bad taste in my mouth, figuratively before I even placed my order. I wanted to know what kind of roasts they had. I wanted to know my options. I guess that was a confusing question. She said "we just have our  roast" I said "ok, well then I'll have that." My fiancé and I each ordered a medium cup of coffee and split the turkey Panini. For two large coffees it was $9.50, but what I thought was cool is that if you keep either your coffee cup or your receipt - you get free refills all day. That makes the $4.25 coffee a little more justifiable. The coffee is pretty good, but the turkey Panini is really what to write home about. It's absolutely delicious. I really wanted to go back the next day and get their breakfast Panini. That will be for another time since we tried Eggslut instead. Review on that later. Overall, aside from the odd confrontation at the register, this place is pretty good.So I'm stuck here in Las Vegas, flight delayed due to the snow storm in DC. This amazing gem is in the New York New York hotel.  So I was walking around the hotel early around 6 a.m. trying to find something to eat, much was not open. So to my surprise I noticed the 48th. I ordered the healthy crepe and it was excellent! I did not realize on the menu that you can also have fruit options which is also very good and delicious. I think I will have one for lunch since I'm here until 4 p.m. anywayFriendly staff and great food! Appreciated that they had the Sunday Night Football game on as well. Sat at the bar and was regularly waited on. Will be coming back!Love me some in and out. Living on the east coast these are non existent. Always speedy service and delicious burgers. You can never go wrong with a double double animal style. Everything is always fresh and tasty. Prices are very inexpensive. Hospitality is always great. Would love to see these on the east coast sometime soon!OK. Seriously just OK. Coffee was luke warm. Service was icey cold. Maybe if I had dreadlocks or piercing in multiple orifices I would get a "hello how can I help you".  The poor attitude is offset by the free WIFI. Nice large table make a good work surface to study off of plus there are many tables and three rooms. So for studying or computer stuff it's great but coffee and service is lacking quality.Not the greatest, I've had better seafood. The aguachile wasn't even aguachile, the campechana juice was very thick and kind of grows. Would not recommend this placeThere was no one to great me and my friend when we walked into the restaurant. Our waiter was sitting down and then she noticed us. She grabbed some menus and stood there for a few minutes while we looked at the menu before walking away. She came back moments later but didn't ask if we were ready she just stood there and my friend ordered then I told her what I wanted. The food came out quick and we didn't get our water until the food came out. She gave us bottled water and we were confused. She decided we would have bottled waters and not tab. I was OFFENDED. We ordered jerk chicken mac and cheese and sweet potatoes. The food was plated nicely and good although everything was spicy. OVERDOSE ON GHOST PEPPER AND SCOTCH BONNET PEPPERS. The waitress never asked how our meal was or offered us any more water. There was no service Im shocked especially at a place with linens and such you would assume there would be someone to take care of you. She gave us the check we paid and she didn't wait until we left before grabbing the signed copy. Instead she came over and asked if we were finished so she could take it. Never thanked us for our service. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.This is my favorite local spot that is luckily a block away from my apartment. 
I've come at all different hours and days and it never seems to be too crowded, not sure why, the food is great.
I've tried their chicken quesadilla which is delicious although I wish they added more quicken. 
Their pulled pork sand which is also very tasty, and is what I typically recommend my friends who want to try this place out.
Their devil fries are also pretty darn good and have a nice kick to them.
Their grandmother's cake or whatever the chocolate cake is called is mouth watering for those who ,like myself, love chocolate. It's pretty rich so I can't eat a whole slice but who doesn't like left overs!? 

Anyhow to summarize this review, check this place out, nothing on their menu has disappointed me yet and it's a cute place, who doesn't like cute things.A great family run place, that tastes like a genuine Italian ristorante. I say: "Ciao bella"!

We arrived last night looking forward to a well prepared Italian meal. Our expectations were peaked by all our Yelp friends, raving about the personal service and delicious old style Italian food. We weren't disappointed.

The owner, Pasquale greeted us as we came in, and sat us in the back.  It would provide a good place to observe his personal touch with all the customers.  Our server Cody came by almost immediately to ask if we had brought any wine, and if he could open it and bring us glasses.  As others have noted, Ristorante Giuseppe is a Bring Your Own (BYOB) place.

Our oldest was celebrating her Birthday Day, so we were in a festive mood.  I've taken some photos of the interior of the restaurant. Clearly they were working on that Italian Grotta feel.  It has some buca di beppo type wall decorations.  But unlike that chain, here it's decorated by actual family photos and vacations shots. Very genuine!  Just like Pasquale.

We started out with the bruschetta.  It came with four pieces of italian bread for $10.95.  It might have seemed pricey, though the tomatoes were sweet and had a interesting topping of several cheeses. Delicious.  We next shared the Antipasto.  It was a very full plate of greens, meats and cheeses for $8.95.  The dressing was a light oil and vinegar that was just right.

For our entree, we each tried something different.  I went for the capellini with their homemade Neopolitan sauce.  Cody talked me into one of their meatballs, which was good.  But, not as good as their pasta and red sauce.  Sometimes with a marinara, if it's left to cook too long it can get bitter.  Not here, it was naturally sweet with chucks of tomato.

My wife ordered her favorite dish of Chicken Parmigiana, that came with spaghetti for $14.95. It wasn't a pounded piece of chicken cutlet, but instead an entire breast. Very nice!  Our daughter ordered the spicy Pasta Alex  for $15.95.  The menu describes it as the Chef's creation -- of pasta in a cardinale\/pesto sauce with roasted garlic and spicy, crumbled, Italian sausage.  It was outstanding!  The heat came from the crusted red peppers and was just right.  The sauce actually reminded me more of a vodka cream reduction.  It was sweet and full of flavor.  Clearly the best of all the dishes!

For dessert, we tried the flour-less Chocolate cake, the Tiramisu and a Cannoli for $4.95 each.  I've taken a picture of the Tiramisu, because it came as an individual piece of two moist lady fingers. Wow!  

If you're out and it's late, I would highly recommend coming here just for dessert and espresso.  It would be well worth it.

Our bill came to $88 in change including taxes but before gratuities. It was hand written and not itemized.  Another one of those personal touches which some might find quirky.

After getting home, I exchanged a bunch of messages with Yelp'er Michael T on how delicious the sauces were at Giuseppe's.  It's that unbridled enthusiasm and passion that folks have for this restaurant and it's owner Pasquale that make it special. 

If you are looking for a white table cloth, foo foo experience; you might be disappointed and not understand the beauty of Ristorante Giuseppe.  But, we weren't, and we'll be back real soon.

Enjoy!I can't believe I keep getting tricked into eating here. Their advertising money is well spent it draws me in time and time again. I ordered the famous star special and there was nothing special about it. The hockey puck burger patty mixed with the wilted veggies just did not work. Two stars is being generous.24hrs... and great quality!!!!!!!!
Since there is enough said about the cheesesteaks, thought I would add something different.
Pop's has the best breakfast sandwich!! Steak, Eggs, Cheese!! I love it and it has saved me from the hangover monster on more than a few mornings!
Also, the turkey sandwich is top flight! The bread is amazing, and makes sense that they bring it in from back East.
I don't eat "fast food" and I consider Pop's to be anything but typical fast food, the higher quality is obvious, and I don't mind paying for it.
Highly recommended!I really had high hopes for this place. My cousin and I both ordered an iced chai. There was so much milk in it, you could barely taste a hint of the chai. We both thought it tasted like cereal milk. Two sips and we tossed both our drinks. What a waist of almost $9. I might go back and try a regular coffee but until then, 1 star remains.First time eating here ordered the poutine burger and I was a but skeptial at first but I'm glad I went with my gut feeling because it was amazing a bit sloppy so wouldn't recommend for a first date lol but other then that it was fantastic I'll definetly be returning!Myself and another couple enjoyed 3 entrees: the salmon, the shepards pie and the lamb shank. I'd just like to say, Robert Irvine lives up to his reputation as a chef who can make a dish seem like it took 24 hours to prepare while constrained by time it takes to deliver food quickly to hungry patrons. The salmon glaze left us wondering, how could such flavorful carmelization complement so well with the fresh-caught flavor of the fish? The shepards pie made with ground lamb remarkably did not leave a greasy after-taste. The word I'd use for every mouthful is sumptuous. And then, there was the lamb shank. How did Robert Irvine devise a recipe that would explode in your mouth with such flavor and yet not be overpowered by sweetness? If you like rich mesquite wood smoke in bbq meat, try the lamb shank. It's amazing!It was a little hard to find at first, but I'm glad we did. This is my favorite place in Charlotte. We were told to order a burger only if you were VERY hungry. I did just that. The portion was huge. I couldn't finish, but it was delicious. My favorite thing here was the deliverance roll (barbequishi). Again, it's a lot of food, but I've never seen or eaten anything like it. It is great. I will recommend this place to anyone visiting Charlotte.We had a great time with amazing seafood and a staff that worked as a team as we had never seen before. The chef was informative and made sure that you were happy with your meal.
In fact everything that kept coming out of the kitchen for other guests looked so good we ended up placing more orders.

To top it off we went out of our way to go back the night before we had been scheduled to fly home and the staff and chefs remembered us and pampered us even more.

This is the type of food and service that I would make it a point to return the next time in Las Vegas!!Great good and drinks! The staff is really nice. Not many games but the games they do have are awesome! Check it out :)Great deli sandwiches that are easily enough for two.OK sooo...whenever I come to Vegas, I go to this restaurant to have BANANA pancakes...they are normally good, as is the service but today...SO NOT!

First off I had to keep asking for water...Secondly our waitress seem to forget about us...Third got my food it was cold...Fourth, had to get up to ask the waitress for warm food, and she had the nerve to ask me, "do you want me to put it in the microwave"..WHAT..NO i want fresh food...FIFTH waited 7minutes finally got up and told her to forget my order...

THE FINAL STRAW....I SAW ANOTHER GUEST POINT TO A BUG, NOT A FLY, NOT A NAT, A BUG ON THEIR TABLE!!!

GROSSSSSSSSSSS...I GOT UP, went to go and pay..and all that was said was, "ya that happens sometimes"...GROSSSSSSSSS

NEVER GOING BACK...IF YOU GO BRING YOUR BUG SPRAY!I really am reluctant to write this awful review because the owner was so nice and the food they used to serve was delish. The new server\/ cook\/ host has no clue what's on the menu. I ordered my usual lobster Benedict and received one English muffin with avocado and lobster on it ... No eggs, no sauce ... It was disgusting and appalling that a chef wouldn't know that eggs were included in that dish. Oh and it took 1.5 hours to order and get served and we were the only ones there.First visit today! Food was awesome Had the lobster roll, clam chowder, crab cakes and crispy calamari! Everything was perfect!  Will be going back!  The young lady was very helpful with suggestions! Now one more of our favorite places in Scottsdale!First time to visit. Fantastic service, food and ambiance. Jesse, our server, was a rock star. Fun to talk to, always paid attention to our libations and made great recommendations on food and wine. Highly recommended!!This small dessert shop is located downtown, right in front of Lasalle College - Great accessible location, although I could definitely travel a good couple of miles to be able to taste their creations. 

I have to admit that I was once a Juliette and Chocolate fanatic (don't get me wrong, that shop is great. I am definitely not hating on J&C), but as of today, I have to admit that I have a new passion, i.e. Cacao 70. 

I visited this restaurant tonight with a friend, and had no trouble finding a seat although there were a bunch of customers already enjoying their sweets. 

I ordered the Triple Chocolate Fondue, which was a combination of white, milk and dark chocolate, served with sides of strawberries, bananas, and pieces of waffles\/brownies. P-U-R-E   M-O-U-T-H-G-A-S-M, must I say!
Being as reckless as I am, I even topped that gigantic plate with a side of Semi-sweet hot chocolate. I must admit, I almost suffered from a diabetic coma, but I enjoyed every minute of that sugar rush. Carpe diem. I also promise to be back soon, as I need to try all the other types of hot chocolate on the menu (and those are very numerous, believe me!)

Indescribable experience, you will just have to try it to understand what I mean!

P.S My co-foodie ordered the Cheesecake - The presentation is very different from what you would usually expect from a cheesecake, and that works just fine! The taste? Unbelievable.If I could give this place negative stars I would!!! So bad, from the time we walked in we were told that they were closing in a few minutes instead of greeting us like they should have. I hope that the money I payed for this garbage went to help some fire station, it was certainly not worth the money I spent in there!!! Awful!!!! Not ever again!!!Tried this cafe just because the small amount of people waiting outside peeked my interest. It was breakfast and I ordered the corned beef hash. A must try if you typically like it! The coffee was fresh tasting and service was alright. I'd return if I were local and give it another try.Good food, service and atmosphere. Had Chang' spicy chicken, tasted fresh and flavorful. Ask for the trio sauce if you prefer a little extra heat.A good lunch option if you're in the area. I came just after the lunch rush (1pm), so it was quiet and I could take my time ordering. The menu is a bit confusing, the placement of items had me smacking my head with the "why didn't I see that before I ordered?" thought.

The daily lunch special (beside the register) was certainly a good option, but if you'd like something a bit lighter, the half sandwich and soup option is in the snack panel to the right? That's what I ended up getting, and it was more than enough for me! I was so full before I even finished it, but grilled cheese sandwiches just aren't as good if you keep them for later so I toughed it out and ate everything (I know, I deserve a medal lol). The soup is amazing - so savoury and flavourful. The grilled cheese sandwich was good, but nothing amazing. Perhaps I should try one of the specialty ones again to get a better gauge. 

The place is comfy with a few four-seater spots and a cafeteria style ordering vibe. Decent option for lunch if you're in the area.Maria, who took my phone order was very pleasant and patient answering my questions about the menu.
Our breakfast order was prepared quickly and was still pipping hot when we got it home.
There are plenty of yummy menu choices. We ordered breakfast burritos with chorizo. They were very good with fresh eggs and lots of cheese.
I also had a raisin bagel with cream cheese and peanut butter...yummy.

I didn't pick up the order, but they offer curb-side pickup, which is fantastic.

Very yummy inexpensive breakfast in an area where meals are overpriced.I go there for food and not really for the *fun* so I may not be experiencing the best of this place, but it still earns my 4 stars. Nice decor, good service and good (but not great) foods. Definitely a place to go with your friends, family members and co-workers.The sporting environment and TVs are nice and the outside seating area. That is all! Drinks are overpriced unless you like beer. I came to watch a football game and they don't have happy hour for the games. Beer only. Burgers are overpriced and average.Pork belly skewers were awesome.  The french 75 cocktail was great. The old fashion was too sugary for my taste, it cut the bite of the bourbon too much.

They didn't mess up my martini, I am always blown away by how many bartenders cant make a good gin martini. I would have liked it in a martini glass though, just me being picky. 

We will definately be back, though not as much as I would like because it is a bit pricey.This is my favorite Thai place downtown! We usually get food to go and it's great! The fried rice and pad Thai are my favorites!We stayed in a mini suite.  It was clean and very nice.  Lots of room, 2 tv's, refrigerator,  small table and chairs, couch, 2 big chairs and dressing table\/desk.  the bed was wonderful very comfortable.  We found the place very quiet.  Checking in went well we arrived way early and they got us a room right away.  Checking out was a breeze on my iPad.  We would for sure stay there again and recommend it.We had Yassou's delieverd to our office and it was my first time having Yassou. I was enjoyed my meal very much, the traditional gyro was so flavorful and the chicken kabobs were easily eaten on the stick, i wasnt a fan of the baklava the ratio of filo and filling wasnt even there was to much filo and not enough filling but other than that the meal was fantasticI visit this place frequently for lunch.  My favorite is any of the bowls (chicken or beef, spicy or teriaki) with broccoli and the mushrooms and onions added.  They give you way more rice than is consumable, but that's ok.  The food is fresh and delicious and the prices are very good, especially for the bowls.  They often have a corned beef hash with eggs (on rice) special that is also really yummy.  On Fridays, you can get an order of ahi poke.  If you come for lunch, get there before noon... or expect to stand in line to order and you may not get a place to sit!Hold on to your receipt!   I was surprised to see my credit card charged for more than double the amount that I paid for lunch for me and a friend at this location this weekend.  I called my credit card company who verified that while the authorized amount was for $23 and after a 20% tip totalled $28 I was somehow ultimately charged $64.  My cc company encouraged me to speak with the restaurant to see if I could resolve the matter with them first.  

I first called the restaurant and spoke with the woman who had served me (owner?) and was told to come in so that they could resolve the matter.  I was told that "we usually don't make mistakes but they happen".  When I went in the same woman insisted that they did not charge $64 to any one that day, but they did not appear to have my receipt in the 10-15 receipts from that day that she brought to the counter to review in front of me.  When I asked if we or she could review the receipts more slowly to determine if my receipt from that day was even in the pile, she became more agitated and emphatically exclaimed "Why don't you believe me?  It was only me and my daughter here that day!".  While I would love to be able to afford to give a $40 tip, I can't.  I assured her that I wanted to figure out what happened and I was not accusing her of anything.  While I can understand that one might be defensive at being informed that a wrong amount was charged by their restaurant to a credit card company, this person offered no ideas on how to resolve the issue and did not appear to want to get to the bottom of this.  

Uncomfortable with the interaction, I left to talk to my credit card company to initiate a dispute. This was a frustrating experience especially after a long day of work and I am disappointed to say the least by how this was handled by the business.  We can all lose our cool at times but looking back and realizing that my friend and I had also been upcharged for fries that we hadn't even ordered or asked about, I am feeling suspicious of this business' integrity.

Unless some extraordinary explanation comes through from this investigation, I am reporting this location to the Better Business Bureau.  In the meantime, I have submitted a copy of my receipt to my cc company and am waiting to hear back.This is a review of the Eastern location (I've been to both in Vegas). I liked the decor, it's larger - or at least less crowded - than the location in Chinatown. The food quality is great, service was quick, and everything was clean. My only complaint would be that the Chau siu portions are not that large. I would definitely return, I guess I don't need to eat that much meat.Came here because of the reviews and was not disappointed.  The sandwiches and sides were fresh and flavorful.  We will definitely be back.  As other reviews have mentioned it is inside an office building.  Just look for the tables and umbrellas outside and you can't miss it.Mmmmmmmm coooooooofffffe. 

So these guys have great things going for them:

1. Ample space. 
2. Stupid friendly baristas. 
3. Incredibly priced java and tea.
4. A menu that makes me indecisive (so many choices).
5. A good locations downtown yet off the beaten path. 

And then there's a few things that don't jive with me:

1. Internet situation. Two hour coded time limits. 
2. Pasty. 

But you know what, I just won't order pastry and hope it's going to be the best thing I put in my mouth and I'll deal with the fact that after two hours, I'm going to have to go back up to the register and get another little code thingy. The bottomless cup of coffee is way worth it to me. As are the tea options, the chillers, the mocha, the tables, the windows, the... the...VEGAN WARNING--perhaps triple check your food--find pictures on yelp and compare it to what you get.  

* if you order vegan, keep the order simple and do not distract the wait staff with any witty repartee or compliments while ordering.  you can always joke around AFTER the correct order comes in
* when you get your dish, compare it to pics on yelp of vegan chicken, cheese, etc. if it looks TOO good to be true,... it just may be real chicken.

yes, i had an experience ordering the well reputed vegan chicken quesadilla (nachos also get a great rep on yelp). even asking a waiter if my order looked like real meat because the cheese\/meat looked so amazing. he assured me it was the vegan version; then, a few bites later he warned me it was actually real chicken. (it was a mistake--probably in the ordering process.

they replaced it.  offered a a drink to apologize.  no management came by at the time, but the training manager at nacho daddy read my review and wrote me personally to get more details of the incident--so they could avoid future problems.  thank you, taylor.Food:
I don't know why anyone would expect good food here.  It's like pub\/bar food.  Anyhow, I wouldn't eat here unless I'm super hungry.

Drinks:
It's crazy busy here, especially when you are in the arcade area.  They must make so much money off of this.

Games:
They have a great collection here, in my opinion it is better than Playdium.  The only downfall is that half the machines are broken lols.  Like damn it, just fix the machines.  Not only is it packed on a Saturday night, but now I have to wait until the next morning?  Anyhow, I always enjoy coming here to have fun and I'm delighted when they add new games.  Just come in with an open mind =pCosmo is one of my favorite hotels on the strip. First of all, its not very big so I don't ever feel lost or too far away from the strip or elevators to my rooms. The table limits are a bit less than what you would find at Bellagio so its a bit easier on the wallet. 
The restaurants in the Cosmo range from pizza slices at Secret Pizza for cheap to your fancy Steak Dinner at STK. There is a tapas place, a burger place and a wonderfully unique buffet in Wicked Spoon. 

Plenty of lounges around and some live music by The Henry (great short ribs Benedict for breakfast) on some nights.

I had the Terrace view room which overlooked city center. My time lapse video from the room here: http:\/\/youtu.be\/CyPkxtlau5E

The room was spacious clean and even had a dish washer. Also in our room was a large shower, jet tub and a huge couch that could easily be another place for someone to sleep. There was even a chair and table outside on the balcony to lounge on.  My only wish is for them to have a poker room, but being how the place is set up, I'm not sure where they could fit on in. Maybe by the Sports book which is already tiny.. but also not crowded so it makes it nice as well :) Yes.. I'm not a huge fan of crowds.Mallorca continues to be one of our favorite restaurants in the area. The service is fantastic. The restaurant is always vibrant and full, yet the servers are diligent in keeping guests happy.

I have dined at Mallorca at least a dozen times and never tire of the menu because of the ridiculously huge amount of specials they offer. Large portions that are always well-prepared describe the dinner entrees. Our group had the spicy mussels from the apps menu (awesome) and stuffed mushrooms that were good. They are stuffed with crab and shrimp and I don't like shrimp or would rate them higher. Veal with Mozzarella, Kobe Steak, Yellow Fin Tuna with pepper sauce and Chilean Sea Bass were our entrees. Each one was better than the others, although my favorite was the tuna. 

  Trust your server to recommend a wine as their list is pretty extensive. We enjoyed an 08 Llai Llai Pinot Noir that was quite nice and selected based on the server's recommendation.

We will go back again and again. Just love itBest AYCE sushi in Vegas!! 

The fish quality is always the best and their fish to rice ratio is perfect! 

I always stop by here whenever I'm in Vegas and is so much better than the hotel buffets!I walked in and said to myself, this place looks familiar.  After looking around I knew I had been there a while ago.  Logged on and saw my review from 2012...5 stars!!  I was flabbergasted.  The sushi was not good.  As someone else had pointed out, if you go when it's not busy, I would agree that you are going to get old food.  

The sushi seemed like if you had went out for sushi and took the rest home with you and then  tried to eat it a couple days later, it's what it would be - rice beginning to get hard, aesthetics have changed, etc.  The presentation on the plates was not good at all.  It just looks sloppy and not very presentable.  I didn't get sick, so that was good.  

The crab legs were okay.  Asparagus tasted pretty good.  Butter pecan decent to okay.

The review would have been barely a 2 until the check came which was 46 dollars for 2 people, straight up buffet.  That drops it definitely to a 1.  When I told the guy at the front of the poor quality of the sushi, long story short he couldn't have cared less. Considering we could have went to sushi-holic instead and paid just under that for as much as I ate for really awesome sushi, I was quite annoyed.  Anyone who says this place is "TOP QUALITY", I have to look at as a suspect review from an owner or something, especially when the person has a low number of views (3).   Save your money and time and go elsewhere!This is a hidden gem. Period. I ate here twice in about a week, which never happens.

I came for lunch both times and the fish was consistently fresh-tasting. The rolls were fresh. Things came out quickly (although there weren't many other tables). My water was refilled frequently. The cooked items were well-done. Some specifics:

-The Philadelphia roll was amazing. So smooth! Probably one of the best I've had.
-The spicy salmon hand roll was delicious and probably my favorite hand roll.
-The tempura shrimp hand roll was a bit of a mistake - just one tempura shrimp with nori, rice, and a little sauce.
-I didn't really like any of the tempura. It was too heavy and oily for me.
-The kalbi\/beef ribs were terrific and I should have gotten 4 pieces (the maximum) both times).
-The tamago was kind of disarmingly sweet. Maybe too much mirin?
-The salmon neck was probably my favorite cooked item. Maybe a bit of a bother to eat with the bones, but one order is quite sizable and the sauce was perfect.
-I ended up having about 10 pieces of sushi left the second time I went (oops) and was charged a $2 penalty (was told it would have been more at dinner). The thing is, they let me take the pieces home for that. It was a really cool thing to do.

I love this place and I will be back.

(10% discount if you pay cash for dinner.)Good, solid, and strangely inexpensive. 

While I didn't find Taste of India to be amazingly awesome, its currently in the running for my favorite Indian option in Pittsburgh. Service was fairly attentive, the naan was hot & crispy, and the chicken tikka was really tasty. 
A surprise: the veggie samosas have just a bit of spice-- unexpected and fun! Parking can be a challenge due to the location (directly across the street from Children's Hospital), but there are lots of meters around (and parking is free after 6pm).It started a little rocky with stale chips, but the rest of the food was bangin. The waitress had a little confusion about what chorizo is. Lol. I gave three stars because of the stale chips and the crappy mall location where we could see some punk kids fighting outside the mall entrance while we were eating.First of all, free chips! The place could use a little renovation. I had some tacos which were about average fare. I was disappointed that they told us all about their ice cream only to find out that they had none to serve when I actually wanted some. Oh, you can celebrate birthday parties here.Definitely the best poke bowl I have ever had!  The ingredients are fresh and super delicious.  I have only been four times and I am addicted for life!!!Loved it! I would definitely come here again!

The lady at the register and the server were very nice and very helpful. I didn't know it was cash only until I was going to pay. They were kind enough to serve us food first then I went to the bank (right across the street) to get some cash. That was a very nice gesture since you usually have to pay first. 

As for the food, Came here to find some Vegan food and boy did I. I've had vegan pho at other places before but here I must say it is above the rest. The broth was great and fresh (as much as it can be for vegan pho)! The vegan spring rolls are out of this world great as well! Very fresh and whole peanuts and warm tofu really made a difference. 

Over all it was defiantly a great vegan meal.Once again, we stopped in for All You Can Eat sushi at lunchtime and had the best sushi ever. We sat at the bar with Sonny and he handled our requests with poise and ease. Our server was great, she was so sweet. Sumo is the only sushi restaurant we go to and I always bring my family there when they come from Hawaii to Vegas. Thanks Jay and Sonny!!I love this place! The food is soooo good and its hard to find good comfort food in the state of Ohio.  The catfish is some of the best I've had and the greens are on point!  They also make great grits and the fact that they have sweet tea is a bonus.  We love that they are open late so after Indians games we dont have to settle for fast food or bar food.  Do yourself a favor and check them out for brunch or dinner you will not be disappointed.Good food, good atmosphere, pleasant staff and a good value. My wife and I split a large and medium pizza with our two sons. We tried Hawaiian, Dr Dre and Bronx Bomber and devoured all. I liked the idea of splitting two pizza types on a single pie and the fresh ingredients. Definitely will try again.excellent atmosphere yummy biscuitslove the decor..Had this for a hearty breakfast before a convention. Held me over all day! Great place to get away from the strip.This is definitely my favorite pizza restaurant in town. My family and I decided to come in and try it one day since we pass it almost everyday. The employees were so helpful and so polite! The food came out fast and the employee even offered sauce to dip our pizza in. They had pizza, paninis and salads, the best part was they were all unlimited toppings! I would definitely recommend this place!My boyfriend and I came here for a late dinner. We sat at the bar. The food was very very good and it wasn't that expensive which was nice after already being in las vegas for almost a week.Was starving and came here for dinner right after going to the Big Bang concert at Mandalay Bay.  It was one of the restaurants that was open late at night and close by our hotel.  We ordered the beef red curry, chicken rad nah and tai chen chicken.  The food tasted good.  Service was good.  But it was a bit expensive, but again, it's Vegas so what do you expect.  Also, for a not so busy restaurant, it took awhile for the food to come out.  The waiter was nice and attentive and our waters were filled quickly.  The restaurant wasn't that busy at that time of night.  Its your basic thai food-nothing fancy or special, but overpriced.Amazing food coupled with outstanding service and a romantic ambiance! I highly recommend!Taco y Taco is right around the corner from my house and I have been meaning to try it. A friend went there and said it was OK, but other places were better, so it wasn't on the priority list. Our favorite taco shop was closed last night, so we figured Taco y Taco was worth giving a try.

They were fairly busy when we walked in, as the fancily dressed manager lady was helping to maintain the dining area's appearance. 

We were greeted with smiles as we ordered our food. When I saw how they heated up the burrito tortillas, I knew I was going to have issues. I am not, and never have been, a fan of warming up tortillas in steam. This makes them sticky and gooey. 

Anyway, I made my burrito, and the wife had her burrito bowl made up before us. Looking at the menu, she wanted chips and guac.
Side of chips: 1.05
Side of Guac: 1.25
Chips & Guac: 2.95

WTF? So, she ordered a side of guac and I ordered a side of chips. Making our way down the line of taco options, we opted to just give one dish a try for the evening. When we were giving details of our order to the cashier, the wife said what her bowl was, and a side of guac. I gave info on my burrito plus a side of chips. The cashier gave us a smirk and said she was going to ring them up separate, since it is cheaper that way. We replied by informing her that's why we ordered it as we did.

The soda machine, for the one flavor the wife wanted, was broke, they were kind enough to just give her a bottled soda.

Sitting down to eat, the burrito was the length of a plastic fork (see photos) and had less circumference than a can of soda. 

Picking up my chicken burrito, it was already cold (partially due to the pile of sour cream I had included, I am sure). Oh well, I wasn't shied away by that fact. The stickiness of the tortilla was tough to get over. I prefer a crispy burrito to a soggy, sticky one.

Flavor-wise, it was good. Nothing to write home about, but it was good. 

Their chips were great. I don't know what they do different to them, but they were very tasty, nice crunch and fresh.

If the standard places we prefer to go are closed, or we just don't feel like driving that far, Taco y Taco may get a second chance. Otherwise, we'll stick with Baja Bar & Grill, Chipotle or Zabas.Love the sauces. The sweet is really sweet. And the Lamb beef is killer - tastes like real steak and lamb.We stopped by to have a late night bite to eat.  We ordered a basic burger which was quite tasty.  I loved that they had grass fed beef and organic offerings.  Coming from Seattle, we're kinda food snobs when it comes to those things.  Its a little pricey but worth it.first time coming here got pad thai (to go), and it was just okay, kinda flavorless. they quoted me 5-15 minutes but it took 30. underwhelmed.There is NO excuse for a restaurant to leave out food in an order. Period. Every.single.time. I have no idea why i return to this location... Other than convenience. Tonight I spent $24 to feed my family. I ordered 4 soft tacos, 2 hard tacos, 2 bean and cheese burritos w\/o onion, 2 Mexican pizzas and a burrito supreme w\/o onion. Of course they rush me off after a quick perusal of a dark paper sack. The guy even tells me "the ones with no onion are marked." When I get home, I have 1 Mexican pizza (there goes dinner for my 9 year old), 1 bean and cheese burrito (sorry 4 y\/o! Forgot your burrito too) and the burrito supreme was accurately marked to have no onion. But alas it had onion... And TONS of it as if we asked for double onion. Sorry mom... You can have cereal if you want?? Ugh. I HATE you Taco Bell. Learn to review your orders or go work somewhere else.Awesome AYCE spot! Tons of options, great sake and my server Celeste was very attentive and knew the menu very well. She was able to answer all of our (many) questions and gave nice recommendations.Excellent staff, like the remodeled interior, their Japanese quinine is great, like the take on bento, excellent sushi selection!My favorite spot for those nights when you don't want to cook but don't want to go to a restaurant. Very reasonably priced and the food is very good. Love the green guacamole salsa. They will also give you a bag of fresh serrano's if you ask.The ice cream is really good, and the employees are always super young and really nice. If you order a small vanilla bowl or cone and they know it's for a dog they put a bone in it for them. Super nice. I really enjoy it and it's super good. It is cash only but they have ATM, and a drive through.BEWARE of the Resort Fee PLUS tax per day and the so called 2 "free" buffet per "stay" = this translates to your entire stay at the hotel regardless of the number of nights paid, NOT per day.  Here are the REAL charges that stack up and were greater than the advertised price I paid for the room.  Fortunately I did read the fine print about the resort fee beforehand so I was expecting that BUT did not know about the ridiculous 12% tax added above that and the deceptive "free" buffet per "stay."  They should simply clarify to say two total buffetsor hand out vouchers. They were able to steal $75 from me but what's worse was the horrible food. Had I known it was not free, I would never even pay $1 for their buffet. 

Add insult to injury are the incredibly rude and obnoxious behavior of two employees. My check in clerk Jerry was sarcastic and made inappropriate comments.   The bell boy who checked my luggage for holding actually said to me "You know, I won't be here when you pick up your luggage," and hesitated as if expecting something to happen.  Umm Yeah and why does he feel the need to tell me that? Ohh are you trying to remind me to tip you because you hauled one small carry on luggage onto your wheeled cart? Seriously?! I get it that any employee working on the strip whether it's a hotel, store or restaurant has to deal with thousands of people from all over the world and after a while they may become numb or rude!   But Disneyland has the same issue and you don't see employees behave so atrociously! I know I'm comparing Disneyland with Sin City, just because the contents are different doesn't mean the service has to be. 

Some tourists' first experience in United States is in Vegas, and I cringe at the idea that if they experience the poor service I received at MGM Grand is any indication of American hospitality, I would be ashamed! 

The only saving grace to this truly one star hotel is Rosa my housekeeper who I happened to chat with on my way out and as she was entering my room to clean.  She worked there 20 years she said. She was friendly and you could tell she still has pride in what she does after all that time.  

It's obvious they don't want to spend any money to update or clean their carpets to the west wing rooms.  Most of the hallway carpets were disgustingly stained while it hides behind the facade of the beautiful polished look of their lobby. The small rooms are outdated from the 80s\/90s era.  They know this and will try to upsell you to their more recently built\/updated grand rooms for an additional $25 more per day or suites for just another $1000 more per day. 

MGM resorts owns 6 hotels on the strip. I won't give any of them one penny of my future business because there were too many misses by too many employees who simply didn't care about my experience.

*My response to MGM's feedback about my review: This only confirms their incompetence and poor customer service by completely ignoring all my other complaints and only saying they're sorry "I was confused" about the buffet stipulation is a back handed apology.  They can't even hire a competent Manager to properly respond to complaints in a meaningful and effective manner.A charming spot with delicious craft cocktails and friendly staff! I will definitely return to try the food next time I'm in Montreal. A good place for a date or catching up with friends.This was a great find!  I had the Arepa Benny and a regular coffee.  The coffee was amazing!  All of the latte options also sounded delicious.  The Arepa Benny was delicious with coffee rubbed beef and plantain chips on the side.  

The service was fast, kind,  and attentive.  The environment was relaxed, and the price was very reasonable. I would absolutely come back here!Great food. Nice ambiance. My SO got the lunch buffet and was quite pleased. I order the Chicken and Rice and loved every bite of it.Been here once. I sat at the bar. The food was good. Its seating arrangement is odd in relation to the building structure. Overall its good.Located in the Downtown Grand Hotel Casino, in Downtown Las Vegas. The food is very good at this hipper than thou coffee shop. Here is where the hipper than thou thing gets me. First, I waited at the front for almost 5 min. before anyone came to seat me. Second I had to go to the bar to get a refill on my water, my waiter was too busy being cool and hip to refill my drink. Bottom line there are better coffee shops downtown with better service. Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!We were thrilled to get a last minute reservation on Valentines Day. Our experience started off with our incredible server-wish I could remember his name! He was knowledgable about the menu and his recommendations were spot on to each of our tastes.

We started with the zucchini fritters. They were unique in that they had cheese inside but could have used a bit more seasoning--but nothing that the delicious aioli couldn't fix!

For my main I ordered the sweet potato tortelli. It was a dish that intrigued me from the menu and our server recommended it as well. It was good but in my opinion could have used sage to give the dish more flavor. My husband got the short ribs stew which he raved about. The cornbread that came with the stew was so good, not too dry and just enough kick from the peppers inside. 

We finished with dessert which were perfectly portioned. We split the cheesecake which was to die for and the chocolate cake that was great as well.Drive thru is painfully slow - 25 minutes with 3 cars all for a coffee. The vanilla latte was terrible.

On top of all that the girl at the drive thru was rude ' if your going to have slow service and terrible coffee at least have outstanding customer service.

Will never return.Excellent bbq! Had brisket not to tender not too tough it's a delicate balance and they did it right ! Sauce was very spicy!  Also had ribs again not too fall off bone just tender enough to rip from the bone and excellent smokey flavor!  Waitress quickly dropped off the trays of food and was never heard from again, but  then again you go there for food not service !  Ohh and lastly, portions are enormous.   Only the really big eater will finish the entire meal at one sitting.I used to love coming here but I was charged $1.35 for peppers on my bowl when your menu CLEARLY displays it includes peppers! & if you are making people pay extra then you should have it displayed!!!! & I didn't even get a lot, I would have rather gone to the store and buy a WHOLE pepper for that much! Such bullshit & your staff have a stuck up attitude when I questioned why I was charged extra for something so little! I used to come here all the time but I no longer will because of the poor service I was shown!! Unexceptionable!!!Fast and good service. The ramen and gyoza was really good. Tried the king of kings and nagasaki champion. The spice was right. Definitely reccomend.Great food and authentic Japanese food! Try their Foegrie and all sorts of flavorful grilled meat. The best authentic Japanese grill eatery and good service! Then try Raku sweets around the block.My husband and I literally just walked out of this place after being there for a short maybe 3 minutes. The bartender was extremely unpleasant, clearly didn't know how to engage in conversation and had an attitude when I asked her if she could put on the Heat vs. Raptors game. It was evident she whispered something about us to another server as she immediately looked over at us. My husband wasn't even asked what he would like to drink and when he acknowledged the bartender for putting the game on she basically ignored him  and was completely expressionless. We refuse to spend our money at an establishment like this. Its no wonder the parking lot was pretty much empty! On to someplace else....thank goodness!My friend and I went yesterday for lunch. We got senior rate that's 11 to 4 monday thru Saturday. The food was fresh and choice huge. We also arrived at 215. The staff were very attractive and kept checking on us. We will go back hope they keep up the high standard they have set. So much better than the local casinos for food,service and price!Stop here and eat. Don't hesitate. What a delightful waiter with a charming smile and dancing eyes!  We all cleaned our plates. My lamb shank was one of the best I have eaten with the meat falling off the bone.   My family also ate the duck breast, the fettuccini w coppa and pork. And don't forget the dessert profiteroles: 2 small ones that were just the right size. 
Yum!Decent take out sushi set in a fast food manner. A little pricey for how many pieces they give you, but it was tasty for what they had.I havent tried a dish I dont like here. Highly recommend to everyone. The owner is very personable. The sushi chef is the best around.... (And ive tried them all). Been going here for years and it never changed..... Great food... Great service!! And they have grill tables where you cook at the table. Super great experience and delicious food!!!! Two thumbs up!!!Really good Kale salad, reasonably priced for portion received with goat cheese fritters are awesome.I don't usually write reviews but felt compelled to after our AMAZING! experience at this restaurant.  The atmosphere was elegant but casual. The food absolutely spectacular! We decided, at the suggestion of our waitress Annemarie, to try the chefs table so we could get a sample of more dishes.  It was absolutely perfect! If you are looking for great Italian food and a awesome time then you need to try this restaurant and ask for AnnemarieThe East side of the vegas strip is not known for its Sushi but Yama sushi is absolutely a hidden gem. Amazing All You Can Eat menu and has become one of my top sushi restaurants in all of vegasThis place is the best El pollo Loco that I've been to because the employees make you feel welcomed and happy to help out. The cashier was extremely pleasant and the other employed were friendly and my food was all ready to eat within a few mind of ordering. 

This pollo Loco blew my mind.A smaller buffet off-strip. Good place to come for cheap, typical american food. Not great, not bad. The restaurant is clean and the service is very good. Nothing spectacular to report.first time been to this resturant was 2 years ago with my ex bf... after that i move to edmonton, i cant remember where about is this resturant also the name. last year i visit calgary want to find this resturant,but i went to the wrong one. yesterday i going to calgary with my husband ,go on yelp check up review ,when i arriver there ,i m so excited ....cos i knew,i m by the chance to bingo.....

We take order spicy beef soup, clear noodle,short rib,pork...... 

Soup ju ok ,but is real spicy .....but noodle ,rib n pork was soooooo nice.

N they never mean with little dish n vy delicious too.I really like Taco Bell. I mean, c'mon, it's Taco Bell; it's cheap, delicious food. However, I'd like to point out that two of the stars I'm giving this review are for the food ONLY. I've been to this location many, many times because it's the closest one to me, but they're really cutting it on losing my service. On many occassions that we've (my boyfriend and I) come here, the service has been SO slow. Furthermore, they're constantly getting orders wrong. The only thing we ever ask for is for no lettuce to be put on my boyfriend's food. How hard is that to remember? However, many a night we've come home with our order only to find it was full of lettuce and had to sit there for 10 minutes picking it out. If they don't get their act together, we'll take our service elsewhere.There's a really fun atmosphere here. I like to order my Thai food in Thai (being a native) and was disappointed that no one could help me keep my mother tongue sharp. It also took a long time to get our drinks since the barman kept stopping a few times during the making of our cocktails to serve drinks to people at the bar. Otherwise service was friendly.

In terms of food, everything was really delicious. I understand that it is a tapas bar, but we needed to order quite a lot for the two of us to fill up and it's quite pricey for the quantity given. We had Thai food recently which was just as good and half the price. I would still recommend a visit though if you haven't been.Family owned & fabulous! this place is adorable! The prices are decent, waitresses are friendly and helpful. Food service is fast & delicious! They have a lunch special for $8!!!!!!!!!! Also, chicken gravy is on point.This is a very trendy restaurant - Gastropub.  The food we enjoyed was quite tasty.  We sat at the bar because it was a busy evening with post college graduation diners filling the place.  The mixologist provided much entertainment.  My only complaint is that they did not have non-alcoholic beer.Came here for brunch with my parents and son on a weekday and we were very pleased with the food options and the service. It wasn't too heavy sometimes I get food coma from over eating and it was just perfect. Even my picky son couldn't stop eating the rotisserie chicken it was very moist with a hint of smokiness and sweetness. Everyone agreed the clam chowder was unexpectedly delicious so many clams and celery! The prime rib and shrimp cocktail were my favorites but what really stood out were the desserts. They were beautifully made and I wish I saved more room to try them all. I had a tough time picking which buffet to try on our short trip to Vegas but I'm so glad we came here. The service was outstanding and we will definitely be back!I've had second breakfast a lot since my first review. It's absolutely amazing! My go to is the breakfast sandwich! Simplicity = happiness. Bacon and 2 eggs served side side up on an amazing local bun. The duck fat fried hash brown is delicious as well :)Primanti Brothers is one of those Pittsburgh traditions that I regret to say I've never quite been able to get into. I've been here a couple of different times, and the truth is that I think it's a bit underwhelming for the hype that it's given by locals. 

My first time here I got the classic Pitts-burgher sandwich, and I didn't really enjoy the fries and coleslaw piled onto the sandwich. There, I said it. It's just too many flavors going on at once, and I would prefer to have a side of fries rather than have them mashed onto my sandwich so that I can barely taste them. Ever since that first experience, I've asked for my fries and coleslaw on the side (much to the dismay of the waitresses, who look at me like I'm insane for not wanting them on the sandwich). What can I say? I'm from Cleveland. I just can't get into a sandwich piled high with things I usually eat as sides. After trying a few of the different sandwiches, I just don't find that they're anything to write home about. I enjoy the fresh bread of the sandwich, but that's about it. The fries are always a little soggy. If it's your first time in Pittsburgh, I absolutely recommend giving it a try since it's such a Pittsburgh classic. I just don't think I will be rushing back any time soon.This was my second time coming to Echo & Rig and due to the service that my wife and I received, it might be out last time.  When we got to the restaurant, it seemed like a normal day.  Not to busy and not empty.  The hostess told us it would be a wait until we were seated.  Looking around, there was no waiting in front of us so it didn't make sense why there was a wait but oh well.  About 5 to 10 minutes later we are seated by, what I would consider the back, but by the balcony area.  
Now, this day was a rough day for us because it was a heavy workout day and we haven't eaten for about 4 to 5 hours.  Once seated, we were bypassed by every server in the restaurant for at least a good 15-20  minutes.  We were done looking at the menu as soon as we sat down.  I actually looked at several staff members in there eye to signal we are ready, but no help.  We sat there so long I was able to watch the staff meet and greet, a staff member flavor food, two large parties enter and be seated and served before us, two tables get cleaned, and every other customer get seconds or refills before I am even talked too.
Finally a manager came over by the name of Xavier.  He was really nice and understanding and tried his best to accommodate us.  Unfortunately, the straw that broke the camels back was when we noticed that a group who just came in, were receiving water and getting their order taken before we could even get our food.
The service was horrible that night and they weren't even packed, no excuses.  I am not a rookie to restaurants.  I know the routine and how things should work.  That night we were ignored, bypassed, and it was one of the most uncomfortable moments I have ever had in a restaurant.  My wife and I were so embarrassed and upset, we walked out.  I tried to explain the situation to the manager but I think he thought he actually solved the problem.  He didn't unfortunately and I blame his staff before I put any blame on the manager.  Xavier, the manager, did explain that there staff is interchangeable, which upset me even more, because if your staff is interchangeable then the 10-20 staff members I repeatedly witnessed walking by my table could have helped me at anytime.
This place gets a one from me for poor service from such a nice looking restaurant.  They do have good food though.  So go get take out, I wouldn't recommend dining in.Probably the greatest donut shop ever. They're pricey but your tastebuds will be like so what???

Coffee Cake, Gorilla, Carnival were awesome. & OMG Dulce De Leche is my favorite. Extremely tasty, amazing selection, and ingredients, and you can even create your own doughnuts. It's a diabetic's nightmare!!! They also serve coffee and other drinks. Extremely Good!!! 

No vegan options and tons of sugar which is toxic to the brain and body. But the inflammation it causes may be worth it. A once in a while treat for sure! Awesome Possum!!!We have been frequenting this location for over 15 years and after our last visit, we have vowed to never return. To start we were seated at a table with food all over the floor including half a tortilla that staff walked around but not once in the hour we were there did anyone bother to pick up. The restaurant was busy but not packed by any means so there was no reason for the disregard for cleanliness. After we were given menus, I noticed food smeared over 2 of the 3 handed to me and my husband had food on one of his in addition to the table placard that had food stuck to it. We were really rethinking our choice and brought it to our servers attention. When the manager returned with our menus he provided them without an apology saying I had the girls spray windex on these they are good now. When our food arrived, I asked the server for a glass of water which still had not been delivered and he said, I am not your server, you need to ask her.

At the end of our visit, I visited the restroom and should have known what I would find, paper all  over the floor, seat protector dispenser dangling from the wall. As I left the restroom, I saw the manager laughing and chatting with an employee so obviously not busy. When I got home, I filled out the survey and contacted the online comment card to which I haven't received any notification that the cleanliness issues had been addressed. Ztejas changed ownership and I guess their standards changed as well. This review is to warn others that Phoenix has many great restaurant options and dirty restaurants with poor service should never be rewarded with a return visit.Got delivery, so not sure about service\/restaurant atmosphere.
Ordered online through their website, delivery was prompt; food was delivered nice and hot.
We ordered roti, mango chicken, curry pad Thai and brown rice with peanut sauce. All dishes were delicious - flavourful and fresh. Prices are a bit higher than other Thai restaurants but portions are generous. If ordering dinner, will definitely have enough for leftovers for next day's lunch.
We will be ordering again and would recommend.Wow this place is phenomenal! We are foodies from Portland, Oregon, here in Scottsdale for a conference. We don't eat meat, so to start we ordered the Pickled Herring, and the Smoked Salmon Potato Pancakes. We also shared the Crab Stuffed Cod entrée. We practically licked our plates clean, it was so good, really well executed by the chef. Our server was Hazar...he was professional, perfectly attentive and very personable, so nice, we loved him. He totally made our experience. We'd come back in a second and request him! The restaurant ambience & decor is stunning!Food is fantastic and servers are relaxed and fun but still take great care of you! Lots of cool options for food and deserts so everyone should be able to find something they like!Ate here during dinner service. Chef Kiki did awesome job serving us sushi with great speed, but that is all. Major drawback with first experience was me and my friend waited for our hot food too long. We waited for our beef fried rice for more than 15 minutes. We ordered ice cream and it took longer than 5 minutes before it was served. It was not even busy during our first visit. Sushi is good, but service was bland and disappointing.Almost a 30 minute wait for food and then they completely forgot about me and sold one of the items I ordered! Manager did nothing to accommodate me afterwards. This place is NEVER ready for the dinner rush! Never coming back to this location!!!So this is first time at a Popeye's. Got the surf and turf plus catfish. The catfish was great! The shrimp was okay and chicken was above average. Wouldn't go so far as to say best ever but definitely decent. Prices a bit high compared to Church's but they got good food. On Tuesdays they have 2 piece leg and thigh for $1.29 plus tax. The legs are pretty good, I am not sure if I like the legs here or church's better tho... both are great.I went here the other day and was treated so rudely by manager and staff I wanted to jusy run out.  It seems people working here look down on single men.  From calling me honey to ignoring me to disrespecrltful dialogue, I will not be coming back.  This place has gone downhill.Very disappointed today when a party of 6 of us went to lunch at Brio and they would not seat us -- the reason given was that they could not accommodate 6 people.  Many times getting seated at Brio for lunch is frustratingly slow (even when no one else is waiting to be seated), but we've never been turned away altogether.  Seating seems to always be a problem here.  We had to go elsewhere for lunch.Food was good. Server was nice (young beautiful spanish lady) always checking up on us!! Reason for 4 star was because my husbands order didnt taste homemade but it was still good. We'd definitely come back if we are on that side of town.Not Authentic Salvadoran food! They serve Mexican, American, etc. Pupusas do not taste good, a mixed pupusa is just cheese.We stopped in hear quickly for breakfast before we flew home to the east coast. The service was amazing and the food was delicious! The ambiance of the place is cool and artistic! Great place! Definitely a must to try. We got two sammys, a salad, Nutella toast and a cookie! Nothing was a disappoint! Make sure you try it!Supreme pizza and Caesar salad were excellent. The guys working there are funny and welcoming. Definitely coming back!I am so disappointed. We waited for almost an hour, and we made a reservation! The waitress only gives seat to people who speak Cantonese, and those people arrived after us and they don't have a reservation.  So we just left with really bad mood and starving. Never gonna come here again. The waitress also have a quite attitude.Last time I went by here they were closed because it was so late. That was a year or more ago. It was nice to finally eat here today for the first time. I got a rootbeer float, cheese fries, and a Smoke Shack sandwich. I give every item I ate 5stars. Friendly staff, cool interior design. A\/C was pumping strong, which is really nice in Arizona as it is super hot outside. 5 very strong stars. I wish we had one of these near my house. My parents loved it too.Fast service.... That's the only positive... I came early around 8 pm Saturday morning... Asked if they have the artisan bacon sandwich, didn't, no big deal... So i got a caramel machiatto and a chai tea latte...and a chocolate donut and cheese danish, asked the danish to be heated up.... NOW GET THIS: they said they didn't have a microwave to heat up the pastries... Ok I'm done, overpriced coffee shop that didn't even have a microwave to heat up a danish is ridiculous... And this place is in the Mandalay bay AT the strip!These bagels are the best bagels in town. The owner and everyone who works there is incredibly friendly.Dude, seriously. All you can eat everything. Anything on the menu except sashimi is fair game. 

If you go here and don't think it's the bomb, we can't be friends anymore.

My Dad, Uncle and I came here at the recommendation of my brother-in-law. It did not disappoint. We had to wait a while to get a seat at the bar. There's also rooms around the main dining area that look like they're available to reserve. 

The decor is pretty Neo-Far East trendy. Between that and the music, it comes across as a pretty hip, young place. This is not the place to go if you're looking for a quiet, traditional Japanese style sushi experience.If I could put 1\/2 star I would just because our server gave us water like 50 time while we waited about an hour and a half for our order to come out. 
We came to dinner we sat down waited 5 min to give the drink order. Then we waited 20 min for our our server to come back so we can order our food then we place the order at 10:07 we after multiple times asking about our food we finally get it at 1051 then they bring us hot plates with cold food. The guacamole was old it had black spots in it. The food was definitely sub sub par it was like we were served fancy microwave meals without the cheap plastic plates. Like they nuked it then plated it then brought it to us. 
We all kind of picked at our food barley ate it paid the outrageous bill the Mgr did help us out a lil because of the wait he gave us 20 % off which turned out 79 dollar bill to 68 dollar bill but I guess it's okay it just mean the sooner we can leave. I will not be returning to this place nor will I refer any one here by any means. Total disappointment across the board!! 0.001 stars.Excellent burger - best I've had in a while.  Nothing terribly complex about the place.  Simple menu, simple concept. A great fresh burger with just the right seasonings and toppings for $5.These tamales are the best tamales I've ever eaten. They are extra large and stuffed with quality fillings. Nothing comes close to these tamales.I did not particularly enjoy my meal here, but on the other hand, it was not bad.  Hence the three stars.  The food was OK and average at best.  The minced chicken lettuce wraps were good.  The fried tofu with vegetables were good and plentiful.  The calamari with chilis were good too.  All the food was seasoned alright but could have been a little more spicy.  But for the average American palate, I guess it was seasoned OK.  We also ordered an order of chicken satay which was a huge disappointment....don't ever order this dish here.  It was three skewers of chicken meat fried in a frying pan with no flavoring; and they do not have Thai peanut sauce to accompany it, although the menu says it does.  What a disappointment.

The place also was very cold.  The inside temperature was about 68 degrees and they have no booths, only small tables.

I don't think I will return for another meal, with so many other Asian restaurants with better food.Yum!  Rangoon night market noodles, mango pork, indonesian festival rice, lemongrass beef... all make me want to come to Pittsburgh more often!  Want to try new things on the menu, but its hard to resist old favorities.  Can be hard to find parking or a table, but its worth the trip.Just left the place. Now I wish I would have asked for the manager. The teenager Mexican girl decided I was done adding food to my order and closed my bowl. I told her I wasn't done and she rolled her eyes at me! Then when I asked for salsa she shot attitude at me and asked "which salsa?" That caused the teenage girl next to her to start laughing. The eye rolling teenager then said "well I don't know what fricken salsa they want. They have to tell me what they want." I can't believe this girl has a job here! She then turned to me and said "I already put pico and corn in the bowl. That's pretty much the same things that's in the salsa." After putting salsa on the side and paying for my food I am sure kicking myself for not getting her name or speaking to a manager right then and there.1st and last time I will go to this place.  I heard great food from my coworker and I decided to try the food.  I ordered chilli chicken and to my surprise I found hair in my food.  I am so disgusted.Horrible food.  Orange chicken was over cooked, rice was undercooked, mushroom chicken was gross, like it had been sitting too long.  Service was great but food wasn't fit for a dog.  Will not go back.Great food, great service from Crystal.  The meatballs were fabulous,  ravioli was great and their tomato basil soup was excellent.One of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas, hands down, and I'm not alone. Every time I go to this place there is a line out the door because of all the people waiting to experience this culinary delight. 

The noodles and toppings are all delicious, but there's something about the broth that makes this ramen to die for. Also, the pork. It's flavorful and fatty, and I would recommend getting extra if you feel like spoiling yourself. 

Be careful though, this stuff is about as addicting as crack. After your first time, you'll keep going back until you realize it's gotten out of hand, and that you need to stop for the sake of your bank account and health. I put on about five pounds after first discovering this place, and I've gotten many friends addicted as well. 

My personal favorites include the Spicy Tonkatsu with egg and shredded onion, and Kuro with butter and extra pork.One of the best ramen place in Vegas! The broth was really good. Also, the staff is really nice good customer service. Definitely, we will be bavk.Fast service, the food was delicious, and restaurant was clean, and plenty of parking.Next time you're in Vegas and hankering for a hearty meal - definitely drop by Project Pie.  I was here a few months ago over EDC weekend - it was exhausting and I was in dire need of some nutrition.  After some searching, my friends and I stumbled into Project Pie and I couldn't have been happier! I got the BBQ Chicken pizza - it came with red onion, cilantro, Gorgonzola and mozzarella cheese; SO good!  And beyond the fact it's great pizza, it's also an affordably filling meal which in my opinion can be so hard to find in Vegas!I stayed here for the first night of a 3 day tradeshow I was working at Caesars. (caesars was overbooked)

The line to check in was rediculous. I was not happy, hello peeps?!...Can't you see VIP in the house?!

I got checked in and was told I was given a complimentary upgrade to a suite. Finally somebody recognized who they were dealing with!! (actually prob had more to do with the fact that they didn't have my requested room avail in regular rooms-king No smoking-and that I looked like I could be really evil if I didn't get what I wanted)

The suite was huge! Bathroom as big as my bedroom at home. I had a  in room office, fax, my own phone number etc. I was feeling the upgrade. AC worked dandy and bed was comfy enough with nice fluffy pillows.

Only thing that gave it minus a star was again the line (i was in line for 45mins + just STUPID!!) and NO poker room. I live for poker so that was a major bummer.

Otherwise great value and nice rooms.I ordered the Sunday Family Feast and everything was amazing.  They forgot to include the brisket but it was super busy, so no complaints...mistakes happen, it's the way they make for them that counts and Joana the manager certainly hit the mark.  She was so apologetic and I got my brisket and some extra for my trouble.  I live a short distance away and it was no trouble at all.  We had plenty to eat with leftovers, so the missing brisket didn't cause any problems.

Thank you, Joana and Bobby Q's!!!I am no Indian cuisine connoisseur, but I had quite a great first experience at Brar's. My friends and I had traveled from Buffalo (yes...Buffalo) to come here as my two friends were craving some really good vegetarian food. We were seated promptly and quickly greeted by our server. I honestly really do not know a whole lot about Indian food, but I found all the dishes I tried quite tasty and flavorful! Since I've never been to a restaurant like Brar's I was a little worried about the variety they would have being only vegetarian and the fact that I usually can't stomach super spicy foods, but this was not the case at all! I especially liked the area where you could order dosas fresh. They also had a good variety of desserts to top off the meal. The service was quite good, dirty plates being cleared very fast from our table. Overall a good first experience.They drew a cat on a container like I wanted, no other place has done that for me! They're amazing and sweet!!! Also drew a bonus fish! I'm excited to order from here again!!! Honestly good quality as well. :) 
Yellow curry is good.Wow is this place going downhill!  Have been her quite a few times in the past although not a regular.  Menu has changed and the salads leave a lot to be desired!  The black bean burger salad was a favorite of mine....no longer on the menu but you can add the black bean burger to any salad....NOT the same it was borderline mediocre!  The photo doesn't even look appetizing.  Not to mention the last few times we have been there they are out of a lot of the beers on the drink menu.  Too many really good places for food and drinks in Kent and beyond to waste time here.  Nice patio but not worth the sub par food and beer.My first trip to Mastros was awesome. Our waiter in the bar was very gregarious and I wish I could remember his name because he is defiantly the reason they get 5 stars from me. We had a great bottle of wine, a red blend and started off with the lobster bisque soup. Plenty of lobster and filling. Then had the bone in filet. Delicious! Sides of sweet potato fries and Brussel sprouts (which I normally hate but loved.) finished off with lemon cake dessert. Truly the dining highlight of my trip.Huge disappointment!

We were debating between the Weekend Champagne Brunch at Bellagio and The Wynn. We eventually decided on The Wynn due to other reviews saying the Bellagio looked like a cafeteria and the atmosphere was much better at The Wynn.

The food was mediocre at best. Cold entrees, dry fish, overcooked prime rib, watery crab legs. The only highlight was the shrimp (16-20 count). Other than that the only memorable thing about this buffet was the price: $50pp with tax and tip. NOT WORTH IT!READ THIS-Food is tasty but do take out.

 *Key to happiness when eating here. 

Cook rice before you leave the house, their rice is soggy.Love this place! They have constantly changing flavors and take suggestions for new flavors. Ice cream is not too overpoweringly sweet, doesn't taste overly artificial, and texture\/consistently is smooth but not too milky. Their egg waffle goes great with all flavors, and they have nutella whipped cream! People working here are friendly and offer free unlimited samples before you decide what you want. It's located in a small neighborhood but I've never had an issue finding parking.Worst service and accuracy than any McDonalds I have ever been to. I can only name one time my order was correct and all I got was a McDouble and a Coke. Very slow at the ToGo window. You'd think if they were taking that long it must be to double check the orders.It's 3.5. 

Overall an above average ramen place.

We had:

-Karaage Chicken wings ($6):Three pipping hot pieces of whole fried chicken wings in ginger, garlic, chashu sauce, mirin and white sesame seeds.  This one is quite tasty and good value. Rating: 4\/5

-Shoyu Ramen ($11):  This one was okay.  The broth was a bit salty.  Above average thicker noodles.  Pork and chicken chashu were average.  Egg was average.  Rating: 3\/5

-Dipping Ramen cold noodles + warm dipping soup\/Less fat\/mild ($11):  This one was quite nice.  Although the broth was even saltier it went very well with the cold noodles.  Rating: 4\/5We went here for my husband's 30th birthday dinner. The staff was friendly and attentive, and gave great recommendations for food. I had the chicken scarpariello, and it was seriously the most delicious chicken I've ever had! My hubby had the linguine and clams, and thoroughly enjoyed it as well. We had the profiteroles for desert, and they were perfect! I want to go back to Las Vegas again just to eat here! It's a little pricey, but well worth it for a celebration!Unfortunately this Burger King's drive through service is one of the slowest I've ever seen in the morning. Been stopping there regularly for the last couple of weeks at various time and found no change. Always seem to sit in line from 15 to 20 minutes every time.Excellent joint for a late night bite. They are open till 5am which is great for people who get back after partying hard. I tried the chicken shawarma sandwiches and shish tawook and also  some samosas. Everything was great. I will highly recommend this place. Loud arabian music makes u feel you are in a different world. The short guy behind the counter was very friendly and prepares your dish with a lot of passion. Good value for money. The sandwiches were $6 and samosas were $1 each. 
Great food at great location. I stayed at the Chelsea and this place was just right outside.This slot in Red Rock sure does change out a lot. And it never really seems to stick. 

With this place, I'd be surprised if it stuck around as well. It's very overpriced for the quality and quantity of food. These are strip prices, even for the drinks. 

It's a cool place with cool decor. The music was all reggae. Which is pretty bizarre. 

We ordered a pitcher of margaritas, which they don't have on the menu. So they charged us for individual ones. They were pretty good. Lots of tequila, if that's what tickles your fancy. 

For the food:

I had the Carne Asada fajitas. They were again, just okay. For paying $24 for about 4-5oz of decent steak is pretty meh. If it was really high-quality meat, I could see the price being reasonable. But they sure did pack on triple the number of onions and peppers. 
The tortillas aren't homemade. 
We also had a shrimp burrito. It's like something you'd get at a fast food place. Nothing worth spending that much for a burrito. It also comes with pre-cooked rice. 
Pre-cooked rice is my nemesis. I don't understand why restaurants use that stuff. It's very displeasing to the taste buds. 

The service was not so great. Our waiter seemed new to waiting. He was not attentive and we kept having to call him over. He forgot so many things. He was nice, but he really didn't seem to care. 
And guess what? Neither do I. NEITHER DO I!Magic noodle in Scarborough is known for its fast-paced, no nonsense approach to noodles, but the harbord street location offers quite a different feel. 

There isn't the same rushed feeling and it is a more relaxed atmosphere. The best thing about magic noodle is that they're a great alternative to all the other noodle\/ramen joints and their selection is awesome. I almost always get 'The Magic' with the ribbon sized noodles. Usually I get a few lamb skewers too. Portions are gigantic and the pricing is so competitive. 

While the broth is still pretty good, i think there's some room for improvement.LOVE that it's open 24\/7 AND there's a drive thru. The sandwiches are really good, better than going to a fast food joint. I just wish there was more seating inside, because it's often full in there, & seating is limited.First time coming here and it was amazing!!! They're super friendly! It was me and my girls first time coming here and we didn't know what to expect. The food was amazing and so was their coffee!  

If you're looking for a chill vibe and friendly place to eat, go!92nd Street Cafe truly is one of a kind, the real life version of Cheers where everyone knows your name and you're truly happy to come here. 

Having moved to Scottsdale only a few months ago and discovering 92nd Street Cafe, which is truly my neighborhood bar, I felt immediately at home and relaxed. The atmosphere is comforting, the crowd is a great mix and the bartenders are completely top notch. 

Come in on Wednesday or Friday for Carmit and Cameron, very awesome duo and both make amazing drinks and are always fun to talk to, they make some of the most technically correct drinks you can have, they're also great with coming up with custom drinks if you tell them what flavor profiles you like and what you're in the mood for. 

Monday\/Thursday\/Saturday you're in luck with the phenomenal Sue, whose genuine warmth and infectious laugh makes you feel like you're visiting a lifelong friend! Every time I come on those nights it's just as much for the conversation as it is the drinks!

If you're into karaoke they have that too, Wednesday-Saturday, because of the shape of the bar, you can easily escape it if it's not your scene, as is my case. 

Bottom line, there are tons of bars around, the reason I come back here isn't just because of their great prices and food, it's because they become a part of the family and you feel happy to see your friends.canneloni! fresh spinach raviolis! Italian sausage, their recipe!
Not so sure any fancy Italian restaurant can top their deli food.The food here for the most part is very delicious. They have daily specials that are all well priced. The staff are all very friendly. The pizza is good with generous toppings. My favourite dish of all time is their village Greek salad. Though the actual restaurant is a little dated it has the charm of a family run business. A great place to grab a meal during the week.Great food!  I recommend the happy hour so you can try a few things without spending so much money on food (easy to do in LV)!Amazing. Sodas from all over the nation. Staff is super friendly. This is my go to burger place. I seriously drive 30 miles to get here from my house.My husband loves Shrimp Fried Rice and he always gets it at Snaps, he gets it in a to go box because he can't eat it all. He simply loves it. I got  Rib-eye Steak , Home Fries, and Veggies for $9.99 it was great!!! Love itI'm giving it 3\/5 for the poor customer service.  Only one person working the counter who is overwhelmed. Line out the door.  Pizza wasnt ready when we had ordered ahead and then he goes in kitchen for 10 mins to tell me hes baking it now.  Otherwise good tasting pizza.price : very good

food taste : fine. Foods are so salty. 

food quality : Nice
 
Servers : they do not get rid of my dishes.Great service !
Server was very accommodating .
Got the veggie omelet and I absolutely loved it .
Had a great visit and I will be coming back for more stuffed french toast !I recently moved from Texas to North Carolina, and I have been on the hunt in Charlotte for a good barbecue spot. Midwood Smokehouse was almost unanimously recommended to me by everyone I asked. It took me awhile to visit, however, because my friend had a poor experience-- he had food poisoning following a visit to Midwood.  

I finally decided to try it out when my parents came to visit last month, and we all loved it. Everything was great, and that is saying a lot because we are particular about our barbecue!   Great drinks, great food, fun atmosphere! 

Needless to say, I was really looking forward to my second visit when my SO came into town. The second time around, Midwood was very packed. We waited an hour, and the meal ended up being very disappointing. The meat was dry and the service was lackluster. To top it off, the next day we were both sick!  So disappointing! Definitely won't be going out of my way to return.Culinary Dropout has a lot of ups and little downs.  That atmosphere is awesome.  It's really laid back, sometimes it can get a little to loud if you want to have a conversation.  The Pretzels and Cheese Fondue are unbelievable!!!!  I usually make it my meal.  I was disappointed in the Cesar Salad, but the Meatloaf was awesome.  The drinks are ok, and somewhat overpriced in my opinion.  I've always had great service and the staff is really friendly.  Overall I really like Culinary Dropout, but I would recommend this place if you are looking for a quiet place to have a conversation.  This is a place to have some drinks, be loud and be excited for the weekend!!!We had missed Aromas which had been in this space. Kabob is a worthy replacement. Went today for the lunch buffet. Very delicious food well prepared. A mango chicken that was fantastic, a goat soup that looked good. The rice is outstanding as was the dal. Had a nice mango lassi. Will definitely go back.Aside from the sticky tables, which literally left goo on my elbows, I had a great experience here!

I got the classic burger and regular fries, and everything tasted amazing. This is an excellent option if you want something plant-based. 

The service was fairly quick and the staff was friendly. Note that you're going to pay more than fast food. My burger and fries was about $12. My sister spent around $18 on hers.We were hesitant to go here because of the other reviews but....We were really impressed by the food and the portion size. The man who took our order was very nice and polite. The prices did not seem that bad to us. We will definitely go back!Incredibly noisy!  Food and service were excellent.  Really enjoyed the fondue appetizer-- haven't had that in years.  But the noise level made the overall meal experience a negative.Awesome place! We went there without a reservation thinking we would find space but forgot it was a Habs vs. Penguins game night. Nevertheless the place is very nice, great ambiance and vibe. Mostly yuppie crowd but great place to catch drinks or grab a bite after work.
I would highly recommend their home cooked fries, the best I have had.Less quality, less service, less drink refills, less items. 

Less crowded, but that's due to the above.

They must have put the Excalibur restaurant manager in charge of this place.  You can do better than tacos, pasta, rice, fried shrimp, and cafeteria style chicken and fish for $20 in Vegas.We love coming here for breakfast on Saturday. Annessa is the best! Food is great service is better!Première visite a ce restaurant italien  que les gens de l'ouest de l'il Connaissent. La terrasse est grande mais donne sur le grand stationnement du centre d'achat. Mais les propriétaires ont quand même fait leur possible pour le cacher avec des bacs a fleurs. En cette journée extrêmement chaude j'ai commandé une minestrone qui semblait sortir d'une boite de conserve. Décevant.
Par contre les moules marinara était excellentes  
Le service était amical et efficaceIts ok hard to screw up breakfast pretty good skillet, service was great, pricey, no wow factor...I love the Oaxaca special burrito.  Every time I go there I get a consistent product and am always happy.  The tortillas are awesome and I get some to go every time1Delicious food! Great service. Will be our new go to for Mexican food in the area! Can't wait to try their happy hour.I came here today for happy hour and trivia night with coworkers. The trivia was much harder than what I was used to at other bars (which is fine, we somehow placed second). I ordered the boom boom shrimp off of the happy hour menu and it was pretty tasty! The menu is pretty big and they have a lot of games on the patio and stuff. Will probably come back and try out more food!I moved back to Madison a little over a year ago and have had one of the best meals I've ever had here at Fresco.  We came in Sunday, a little after 5:00, there were just a couple people at the bar so we had our choice of tables.  We got seating with a nice view of their sculpture garden and the capital.  My husband and I got a bottle of red, our friend a bottle of white.  We were impressed with the wine selection and were happy with our choices.  We started out with the Shrimp Diablo.  3 jumbo shrimp came pretty quickly.  The garlic and chilli sauce on top was very delicious as were the shrimp themselves.  Of course we wished there had been more and almost ordered another one, but decided not to since our food would be out soon.  The place filled up pretty fast and seemed full by 6.  

Our friend ordered the Short Rib, my husband the Grilled Salmon and I got the Cioppino Pasta.  We all loved our entrees and what we had of each others.  The Pasta had a nice kick to it and was loaded with seafood all of which was cooked to perfection.  It was a huge portion too (I took 1\/2 home.)  We kept making a lot of positive noises with each bite of our food.  :)  Since the appetizer and entrees were so good, we had to get dessert.  We split the Buttermilk Beignets and got a side of the Rhubarb Sorbet.  The beignets were to die for, we were so happy with everything that came to our table.

In addition to how incredible the food was, the atmosphere was amazing too.  Great views, great lighting, great staff.  This made us so excited for the Madison food scene.  It really is one of the best meals we've ever had and we'll for sure be back.  I would recommend this place to anyone.  Amazing all around. :)Great Chicken, but we got served our entree before we got our drink order.  Service a bit too good.

Parking is a nightmare, had to use their valet.Diane and I ate here for lunch right after a short Staycation, and I found the Poutine, pulled pork bathed in a very mild BBQ sauce with unusual slightly melted squares of cheese curds, to be a very good starter.  A half-pound Manhattan Montana Burger conjoined with lean sauteed pastrami, pickles, Swiss Cheese, and Spicy Mustard, was good but the pastrami was tough and the Black Angus Beef patty not that flavorful.  Homemade Pub Chips accompanying this artisan burger were stiff and a little spicy.  I enjoyed the French Fries that went with Diane's Fish & Chips much more.  They were slightly crisp on the outside and tender on the inside.

Three large filets of golden and lightly battered fish were included that provided a welcome slight crunch on the outside but not that much flavor on the inside.  Service was friendly and attentive.  And the pub ambiance very conducive to watching sports events on the several television screens placed throughout the cavernous room.  And all manner of beers were available aplenty.

XXX-1\/2 stars overall!Was a regular customer, but after trying to portion control my meal for dietary reasons, I was disappointed in their lack of flexibility. Was told I had to pay extra ($1.99) for them to put the hummus I was already getting in my bowl, on the side. What!?...I'm asking for customer service, not something for free! A little extra effort goes a long way. 

Lack of common sense, inflexibility, and terrible customer service. It's unfortunate that lack of empowerment caused them to lose a regular customer, I won't be going back!I really wanted to like it but, unfortunately I got a mushy, bland bowl of noodles. Meat to noodle portion was terrible (and yes I saw you can pay for double meat, but still. You'd think the base amount they give could have a little more), and the sauce was just so...bland. I could only slightly taste the sweet taste to the honey sriracha I chose. I ended up adding a ton of black pepper and sriracha myself at home to try and give it some type of flavor. Chow noodles were so mushy. Should've trusted my friends when they said it needed some work!The bison burger and fries were both incredible. Bison short ribs were better than ok but I wouldn't order again-did not wow me. The special side of the day was some sort of cucumber\/corn\/asparagus mix that was a great idea but too much vinegar was used.Easy on and off the freeway, but this place can get insanely crazy with people.I have to say,delicious food. I had the tasty n juicy cheeseburger n the wings were excellent. I've had a hard time finding good food since I moved here.... I love this place n will be a returning customer.thank u tasty grillWent for a girls night. We wanted the app special. Service was super slow. After about 20 minutes we finally were greeted & order taken. Then it took forever for our waters to arrive. 
Shortly after receiving the 1 st order of apps I ended up with a medical emergency in which I passed out. Several customers came to my aid despite the manager being notified & being asked to call 911- in which she refused & told my friend to do it. 
Thank you to those who assisted me

Shockingly we had to wait for our bill in which we were charged fully even though we only had 1 serving each of an appetizer. I needed to leave since I was not feeling well. Not that I was looking for a free meal but I felt it in poor taste since we didn't have much at all - the servings were really small

The fried pickles I ate were awful. I've never seen such a weird cut like this.After hearing so much about Fire, I finally got the chance to go for Restaurant Week.  I ordered off the special Restaurant Week menu (3 courses for $33), and was unfortunately very disappointed.  For the first course, you could pick from a green salad or lobster bisque.  I opted for the lobster bisque and it was pretty downright awful and most of my fellow diners at the table felt the same way.  I did not find a single piece of lobster in the soup.  In addition, it tasted like butternut squash soup which is not anywhere the neighborhood of lobster bisque.  The bread at the table was cold, though the olive oil was delicious.  Some of the bread had such huge bubbles in it that some pieces were literally just a piece of crust.  For the entrée, I ordered the hanger steak.  The other option was a vegan stuffed eggplant.  My steak was full of fat and gristle.  I was only able to chew about 50-60% of it.  It was served with a patty-like creation of sweet potatoes.  The potatoes were pretty tasty but somehow in the process of turning it into a patty, got pretty burnt on one side.  It also came with kale.  I will eat almost anything but this kale, oh this kale.  Bad.  It tasted like it had been soaked in a bottle of vinegar and was nothing other than bitter.  There was a little bit of sweet relish over the steak which was overall pretty tasty.  The best part of the meal was dessert.  They had two options, apple crisp and banana split.  I ordered the banana split which included a piece of banana coated in a thin layer of crunchy caramel, salted caramel ice cream and a ganache brownie.  It was very delicious and ended the meal on a high note for sure.

The service was excellent throughout the meal.  For my fellow diners who ordered wine, the server was very thoughtful with her suggestions.  She was very quick to fill up my non-alcoholic beverage when it was running low as well.  The restaurant is very open inside and has a nice ambiance, not too loud but not stuffy feeling either.

Overall, I'm glad I finally got to check out what everyone was talking about, but I won't be headed back for sure.So if you want to be a shot caller big baller you take your  friends here. Because those of us who hail from big cities... The LA's the San Francisco's, Chicago and east coasters know that this place consistently has great food, engaging polite staff and a wine list that can compete with a  bistro in Napa Valley. We winos who appreciate a good glass of wine with the food fixin's to go with, now have a place to go. Because where the heck do you go to impress your out of town friends in Gilbert. It's Postinos!Great place to eat!

Best dishes are the burrito, taco salad and the stuffed peppers!

Been eating here for almost 2 years now, and still as good as always!Stopped at this McDonalds on the way back to apple picking, and was in the area.

The good: Service is TRULY quick! Two floors of chairs and seats. Orders done correctly.

The bad: Our ordering station did not print our receipt, therefore we had to ask the cashier, who was really busy, to tell us our order number. Option to have table service, but no discs available for that service (just remove it then from the machines). Drinks and ketchup area dirty. Trash cans impossible to find in this place. Bathrooms dirty. At some point, staff passing mop was standing in the middle of doorway and bathrooms and talking to his friend, which made it impossible for anyone to go to the bathroom, or get into the restaurant (and he just stayed there even though people were trying with difficulty passing around him... GET A HINT!!!) Weird parking area that you have to cross the drive-thru lane to get to the restaurant. 

The thing that saves this place is that the food comes out really quickly. If not, it could be one of the worse McDonalds out there.It was great!  Our waiter was very nice and fast with service!  We had the lobster and crab nachos and would recommendWe were very happy with this buffet.

Great selection of great food.

Fresh food

Clean facility 

Good service

"I'll be back"Superb entrée selections with fresh seafood. I only drink water and there's is totally awesome!! Not just any regular city tap water. Bang bang shrimp is a must!!!Accidentally found this place when my brother in law came down to visit after diagnosed with Celiac disease. Great gluten free bakery!!  Owners very helpful and great resources. They were able to sample their products and take some home!!Exotic sea food this place has autentic Mexican food, good customer service. Complains the salsa and chips took a long time to be serve also the food took over 20 minutes to be serve, it wasn't busy so it was no excuses for us to wait long, that's why I'm giving a 4 star may come back!We liked the food here. When they brought our salad to the table with our pizza (we didn't mind) but they took it off our bill for the perceived inconvenience. We will give the NY location a visit.I can't begin to tell you how amazing this bakery is! I tried their chocolatine (went back for it the next day and I don't have a sweet tooth at all), chocolate mouse was very good too (only available on certain days I think), and their lattes were good too! The people there were very nice! But their chocolatineeee! This is a must try. I hope they open a location in Toronto!Good food, as long as you don't need your steak cooked how you want it. Manager seems very nice but had no follow through. Mediocre experience that cost ~$40 per person and was not greatFood was very good both times. They'll need to speed up service to survive. I hope they do because a place like this is sorely needed in the area.Delicious!  Joe's is the best BBQ that I tried in AZ.  I loved all their selections because they have something for everyone, from ribs to giant baked potatoes.

There is really not much I can say that the other reviewers have't said though so I'll just leave it with a 2 thumbs up! 

Oh, and I love the old tractor that's inside. haha  It's a classic... a 1948 A Series tractor.  Tad, the owner told me so! :)

See ya there!I'd seen so many good things about this place and wanted to check it out, so we went for breakfast on our last trip to Vegas two weeks ago. We kept it simple (eggs, bacon, toast, potatoes), which meant we got our food quickly -- very much a plus -- but while the eggs were fresh and hot, the potatoes were obviously reheated from the day before and were soggy with oil. I didn't mind the reuse, but the poor preparation killed what would otherwise have been a tasty side. Our server was friendly and professional; a lot of people came in shortly after we did and she had to hustle to keep up, but she was as attentive as she could have been under the circumstances and we were satisfied with the quality of the service. If I'm back in the downtown area on my next trip, I might give Eat another try, but I'll probably go for a lunch item instead.we've been coming here for 3 years now. it used to be our go to pizza and wing spot, now not so much. they recently changed management and it has gone down hill badly. it used to be we walked in the door and were happily greeted, made you feel welcome.  Now it just feels awkward and judgemental. our last experience was horrible. First lets start with the service.  we ordered a pitcher of beer and before we could order our 3 year old daughter a drink the server just cut us off and walked away. when she came back with our beers we asked her for a kids drink and she forgot about it. had to remind her a second time when she came to take our food order. Ordered pizza, wings and frys. we received our frys and wings first, which is fine, but didnt have any silverware or plates on the table. had to flag down our server to get us plates. when she returned she only brought enough for 2, again neglecting our daughter . we had to flag her down again to get a 3rd plate setting and also ketchup. my wife bit into 2 wings and both were still very raw on the inside, blood was still coming out. flagged down our server again and let her know of the issue. she looked at us like there was nothing wrong and asked  what do you guys want. we told her we dont want raw wings. she removed the wings from our table and had the kitchen re fry the same wings. when we received them they were not re tossed  and extremly dry. all they did was drizzle cold buffalo sauce on top of the wings.also didnt receive  a replacement for the 2 raw wings. mind you their a dollar something a piece. we always  tip 20 percent, the server was lucky she got what we left her. its slowly getting worst and worst. not worth the 60 dollars we spent. also its not like they were busy. there were only  2\/3 tables in the restraunt at the time. they do have a hidden gem, Alix is an awsome server. this server was an older new lady. first time seeing her.Today my wife and I visited this store for lunch. After receiving our order I noticed a hair attached to the breading on my spicy chicken sandwich. I took it up to the counter for another sandwich. The manager not only gave me another sandwich he gave me my money back for that combo that I purchased, and a card for another free sandwich in the future. This is what I call great customer service. My hat is off to Chick Fil A. I have had this happen to me before and the restaurant  just gave me another meal, and no refund. Andrew S. was right this is the best Chick Fil A in Pittsburgh.Theater doesn't understand its own concept. I can go to any movie theatre and watch a movie.  Went there so we could eat a meal during our movie. Sat down before previews started and turned on our order light. Finally visited by a server 40 minutes into the movie. Waited an hour, no food.  Movie was ending told them not to bring our food.  Managers response" not our fault we didn't staff properly".  Must be grooming their managers for success in the real world.  Better off going to a real movie theater and watching your movie with snacks. Save the meal for before or after the theater.What a surprise!    I expected this place to be crawling with young college kids (sorry college kids.).  But I was happy to find it full of professionals coming in on a Friday night to check out the awesome happy hour.

I stopped in with 7 co-workers on a Friday!  I was the first to arrive.  I walk in and look around for a hostess stand... nothing.  I'm doing that distressed "what the hell do I do now" look around.  Waitresses walk past, no one says anything.  I finally flag someone down and ask "is there a hostess stand"?   Nope, no hostess.   You snag your own table.  (Apparently there is a sign outside, that I didn't see.  Get it together Bar Louie, it takes 3 seconds to say, "Seat yourself" when someone misses the sign. It has to happen all day and I think they are VERY silly for walking past me like they did.)  Good thing I got there just before 430, there was a huge 8 top table open... and there were exactly 8 of us coming.  

After seating myself, a waitress stops by to show me the HH specials and the menu.  This is where this place really made an impression.... HH 4-7pm!  Awesome food and drink deals.  They had a Hendrick's Martini on the HH ($5.25)....  awesome. 

I enjoyed my appetizer (calamari), side salad and I had the dirty Martini x 2.  Good deal, total 18 bucks.  I am with it.

My return factor is 50%.  A definite return for HH after work.Worst mcdonalds store. All employees are not happy, not enthusiastic to work. The cashier was not even smiling. They should should just call in sick if they are not happy to work.I received an e-mail from the manager saying that they now have a brand new ice cream machine.  I can't wait to give it a try and bump my rating back to 4 *'s. Thanks for answering my cranky Yelp.I frequent this Tim Hortons daily when visiting my corporate office. Its a typical Tim Hortons with breakfast and lunch items. Although every time I go in its always a struggle. I order a cup of soup, a bottle of water and their chicken salad in a cup not as a sandwich(Im a creature of habit). I always get a blank stare and the question "so you dont want the sandwich?" No, I want a cup of the chicken salad. Put it in a cup, not in bread like a sandwich. Then each time they give me a weird look and the two women working go to get my order and talk about how weird it is that I dont want the bread. I find it hilarious that I'm the only person who doesn't eat bread. I do wish they had healthier food options, but until then I'll stick to editing their food and getting a weird look from the workers.

Overall this Tim Hortons is decently clean. Not the fastest when it comes to service and theres always a long line if you come from the hours of 8am-9am.It's a tough job, pairing a big life accomplishment with a meal. But Honey knocked it out of the park with Cafe Bink last night to celebrate his sweet new gig. I should preface this by saying my favorite meal of all time was at Binkley's two years ago. The meal was something I still find myself daydreaming about. It set the bar. 
So when he told me we were venturing back over to the land of Chef Binkley I was giddy like a school girl with a new lip gloss. 
We arrive and the place is packed. It was pretty small but they worked the space well and offered great outdoor seating.
The menu was well done with cafe-inspired food with a twist. Honey was excited about the pulled-to-order mozzarella so we ordered that to start the night. A nice French bottle of vino was opened for our celebratory toast. 
Okay, the mozzarella immediately brought me back to the food we weeped over at Binkleys. It was OFF THE HOOK. Served with thin crostinis and three amazing sauces- I could have eaten dish after dish after dish of it for appetizer, entree and dessert.  
Entrees were the steak frites, and bacon-wrapped meatloaf along with a side of brussels sprouts with more bacon. Toe-curling deeeelish. The steak frites were perfectly med-rare and the sauce was light and flavorful. The accompanying fries were exactly as you would expect. Piping hot, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside and deliciously seasoned. And what's not to love about truffle ketchup? 
The meatloaf was everything I wanted it to be. Complex yet comforting with buttermilk mashers and charred onions. YUMMMMMM. We also loved the brussels sprouts - we make a similar dish at home and think they would have been even better with a little Sriracha, but what do we know? 
We were full but in the company of such good food and amazing service, we opted for dessert for the first time in a long, long time. Donuts with three sauces? Um, no-brainer. Enter various sized fresh donuts with salted caramel, dark chocolate and yummy creme fraiche with vanilla bean. The night ended as perfect as it began. 
Cafe Bink is absolutely at the top of the more casual upscale restaurants in the area for me and there is no doubt I'll soon return and try their lunch menu as well. It's 10:35am...I have less than an hour to wait. :)Meats. A lot of meats. This place is really different than it used to be. The decor is kind of like an old garage theme? Pretty uniquely decorated. It has a large bar space & a cool disco ball. They also played some good music.

The service was decent. We had different people take our order & serve the food. Our appetizer took a really long time, & all we got was bacon. The bacon was ok. They should consider a candied bacon app or something sweet & spicy instead of just regular old bacon. It wasn't too crispy either. 

I got one of the hot Nashville chicken sliders & fries. Both were very good. The slider is hot! It comes with fresh jalapeños, not pickled, so beware. I would definitely order it again.So good!  There are tons of choices but even from my first visit I've never been disappointed.  All staff are super friendly\/nice.Take a second to read the directions when you walk in.  Discount if you pay cash.   The place could appear cleaner, I think it's the floor that really drags the place down, and the to go seating\/area.  But the food is so delicious.  I recommend pork belly, hollow vegetable with fresh garlic, Taiwanese Salt and Pepper Chicken, red bean buns.5 Stars simple because the service was great and the place was clean. But it really got good when I ordered the ribs. Absolutely, hands down, without a doubt the best ribs I've ever had. Will be stopping in this place again when in town.I don't think anything is allowed to call itself a burger until chefs learn from this place. I am a short rib fanatic. Never in my life had I heard of a chef making a burger by slow roasting short rib, shredding the short rib, and then packing that
Into ground beef. As if that wasn't amazing enough, to add a fruit jam to it and rosemary fries- we're talking top 5 best burgers I've ever had (and I've had my share around the world). My boyfriend got the duck and he was in awe. I can't remember the last time either of us finished a plate and we licked these clean. As weird as this may sound, I feel like food should be made with love and care and these chefs definitely make sure that each dish is made with pride and nourishment.This place is amazing. So much to choose from and everything was delicious. The noodles and the marinated kalbi was my favorite. The staff was super friendly and I'll definitely be coming back. Btw try the banana tempura and the strawberry macaroon!Impressive experience at the Chinese Dumpling House. We got take out and for the most part, only had good things to say.

Started with the pork and chive fried dumplings, which were really great. I mean the name of the place made me have high expectations in the dumpling department, but they were easily met if not exceeded by these tasty things. 

Dumplings aside: The general tso chicken was good and had sliced jalapenos in it which added a nice kick. Singapore noodles pretty standard but satisfying, and while I normally steer clear of sweet and sour chicken - in this case it wasn't sweetness overkill like most places so I did admittedly snack on my dining companions choice. Pork fried rice was the only thing that didn't really impress, but wasn't bad either.

In short: worth trying, and probably the best dumplings in Koreatown!Timber Lodge! What can I say. It doesn't get better for steaks and great food. By far my favorite restaurant in the state. I have been here over a dozen times. I have never once had a bad meal or a so so meal. This restaurant is amazingly consistent. I dove into their porterhouse steak last night. Excellent cut of beef. No salt or steak sauce needed here. I also had to get the baked potato with butter and sour cream. It's a meal in itself. I have tried the prime rib several times. It's delish. Their seafood is fresh and cooked properly. A place like this makes it hard to get apps because you know you don't want to fill up, but the rib logs can not be overlooked. Really well done BBQ. To top things off, this place knows how to pour drinks. If going on a Saturday night, leave yourself enough time for a table. Like I said, have a drink and wait. Then be ready to throw down like a king. Enjoy!I love this restaurant! I go here quite often for lunch and let me tell you, the food is terrific. Its not greasy at all, always fresh. Meat is always good quality, not fatty or with gristle. I highly recommend their chow mein, rice noodle dish, and the beef\/black bean sauce....one of the best ive had.Way too slow, way too salty and enough to get me to break my long streak of not leaving poor reviews. . 

One table when we arrived, people finishing up outside around 1930 on Thursday.  Food took a dog's age to arrive  approx 25 mins ( kids , love to wait, oh yes they do)  


My poutine was awful,easily worst in the valley, and about as salty as this review.

To be  beaten by Food trucks and several bars may not be a disgrace but there are better offerings at ice rink restaurants within the valley. Not saying anything else on the menu is awful but that was the main reason this restaurant was chosen. 

   I  left it mostly uneaten which didn't raise a comment.  Barely any gravy, curds that couldn't squeak if you tried , fries  limp as all hell, I.E.,  Just vile phoning it in crap.   when people don't ask why you buy things to just sit on the table it suggests it's a known issue.  

The kids fared better and really liked their waffle kid's meals which appeared reasonable value and came with a mountain of fries , insultingly bigger than the poutine for adults,but I digress. I didn't eat their food. 

I just can't forsee another outing based on our being in Westgate is event based and if takes this long on a quiet non-event night I'd hate to imagine the lead time before a game.For a hotel casino eatery that's open 24 hours, this place is ridiculous! The prices are more than fair: better than any strip casino and major eateries like IHOP. The food, amazingly, is quite good. The $13.99 prime rib was a bargain, no matter how you slice it (extra thick please). It's no Lawry's Prime Rib, but it's not $50.00, either.

The pancakes are really delicious and, if you get their dine in only special, only $4.99 with bacon or sausage and 3 eggs cooked to order. The only bummer is that on holidays they don't offer the special or on take out orders.

The prime rib burger was amazingly good. The prime rib fork tender with the toppings complementing the double dose of beef superbly. My wife joked "if I wasn't pregnant, I wouldn't be eating this... but it's damn good'" yeah it was. I could've had another...

The Vegas shrimp cocktail was a large glass half full of lettuce and half full of cocktail shrimp (the little, little guys) with cocktail sauce poured over the whole thing. It was ok. Like the shrimp cocktails you get downtown at Fremont. Just don't expect big, fat juicy shrimp. If you want that kind of shrimp cocktail, the Eiffel Tower Restaurant has a good one.

The prime rib beef dip with au jus and horseradish was good, but the Philly cheese steak was just meh. It's more of a beef sandwich with onions and cheese.

The kids spaghetti with meatballs was good enough for my kids to enjoy, but they passed on the meatball. It was rather dry.

The chocolate cake from the counter outside was omg good. The doughnuts were okay.

If it seems like there are a lot of choices, there are. If it seems like it's a bargain, it is. If it seems that I like this place? Oh, I do. I most definitely do...Service so unkind. Instead of "Hello" i got "order when your ready". Idk but to me that is disrespectful. & their freezee machine is ALWAYS down. Not to mention they WILL NOT DO TWO ORDERS. All it is, is a click of a button.This place is great. Ambiance is really nice. Had the signature corn bread and empanadas and they were awesome!  Chicken tortilla soup was the best I've had!  Love this place.I LOVE Hula's. I also highly recommend only coming to the Phoenix location. Great vibe, the patio is nice and dog friendly. The servers are fantastic, Keith is my favorite, hands down. On our last visit there, Soupy was EXTREMELY nice and made up for the terrible birthday experience I had at their Scottsdale location. Get the blood orange martini on the rocks and the spicy thai chicken bowl, you won't be disappointed. `I booked the table at 2:30PM on 9jun for dinner and open my fast with family, we showed up 20min prior to time and guy at the reception turned us back saying sorry, we are all booked. Then he said I tried calling you 30min ago to say we got all booked which we never received any call. This was ver unethical and against the business practice. I would never go to this restaurant and let my contacts know. I got really upset because we booked in afternoon for dinner but they overbooked someone else and said sorry now I cannot do anything. Worst customer service, no ethics, I must go public on their business practice.On a whim, we decided to try Baja Joe's. I was slightly skeptical as the shopping center it is in is old and houses a thrift store and some other oddities. However,  upon walking i was surprised to see how spacious the bar area and dining room were. The bar area had lots of tables ranging from high tops to big banquet tables. There was also a ton of flat screens and a darts game. 

We sat ourselves at the bar and were greeted by  of the many bartenders. She was quite friendly and helped with my indecisiveness with my drink order. I got a Corona-Rita, a margarita with a baby corona in it. It was huge and well made; not overly sweet or too strong. For food, I got a 3 item combo so I could t one ry a variety of items. It had a grilled fish taco, shrimp taco and cheese enchilada with rice and beans. Both tacos were amazing; they were fresh and had a ton of flavor. The cheese enchilada was oozing with cheese and the red sauce was slight spicy and not sweet like canned enchilada sauce. The beans and rice were on point, which is indicative of a good Mexican restaurant in my opinion. My boyfriend ordered two beef tacos, which were braised in some type of sauce making the meat tender and delicious.

One of the owners was helping clear tables and asked how things were. I told him it was our first time and it was a good one. He was happy to hear and gave us a coupon to use for next time. Such great customer service. 

Overall, it was a pleasant surprise and I can see myself frequenting here often and you should to.Indoors: super cute decoration everywhere! Very tasteful. Music is simple and surprise it's French! Bathrooms are sure cute, you get to learn French! 

Setup: It is super confusing where to order, and how to order. It Feels like they have such a great setup but over compensating and making it way more complicated then it should be. It could have just the day we went. 

They have like three counters to order stuff and they split our group up just depending on what part of the menu we order from. Again just a strange setup or we just came in at a wrong time. 

Food: pastries and desserts were amazing! The lemon white chocolate cookie was my personal favorite! I highly recommend ordering something like a hot sandwich or crepes.

Salads and soup- yes are good but nothing special. Tea and coffee are also delicious.Great spot.Popular with locals..a Scottsdale secret that everybody has to  experience when in town.Quite possibly the best fine dinning experience in Arizona. Wesam was our server (he is also the Sommelier). His service was incredible, only to be outdone by the amazing food. 

There were slightly less expensive options but the 4-course Prix Fixe menu we chose was $80 per person. While it's more expensive than our usual "date night", we can't wait for another chance to come back.Possibly the best gyro I've had in the Central Phoenix\/Midtown area.  In fact, I'm sure of it.  It's meaty, it's filling, it's seasoned well.  It is damn good!  The tzatziki sauce has a unique flavor, unlike any other tzatziki sauce I've had anywhere else. The same with the Greek dressing for the salad (they call in something else in fact).  I couldn't believe how stuffed the pita was ... I was so happy about that!  The falafel is also out of this world good.  I only ordered one because I'm skeptical of falafels in AZ.  Some places don't grind the chickpeas up enough for me.  Some places' falafels taste like they came out of the frozen food aisle in a grocery store.  Here at Nino's they're perfect! 

The atmosphere is super casual, definitely a neighborhood place. When I pulled up during my last visit and my GPS said you've arrived, I almost thought this was someone's house.  I didn't care, the yelp reviews said try it.  I hope my review influences you as well.  I dined in - well outside on the patio.  When I first arrived there was only one couple eating outside.  By the time I finished my meal there was a small line on the inside (about 5 people in line) and 3 new couples dining outside.  Clearly, place is a favorite amongst many. I'll most certainly return again and again  

Oh ... There's free wifiMy wife and I had a very tasty lunch. She had the California Cobb sandwich on Cheddar Garlic Jalapeno bread. It was real turkey not cold cuts. I had the Smoky BBQ cheddar chicken on grilled sourdough bread. The chicken was roasted (one again not cold cuts).Both sandwiches were very fresh, healthy portions and great tasting. We'll definitely be back.As a group of four, we had the seafood gumbo, chicken sausage gumbo, the shrimp ettoffee, jambalaya and coleslaw. All were very good. 
Clean restaurant,friendly staff. We'll be back. 
Got my eyes on the shrimp po boy.We went for breakfast Saturday after driving up early from SoCal.  Great staff, good food, we will go again.   Thank you!Nice little mom and pop type place with excellent chicken and waffles and even better customer service.The best breakfast food place to eat in Vegas. I wanted something with eggs and my friend was craving for biscuits and gravy. I ordered the chorizo hash and he ordered the biscuits and gravy with sausage. Their portions are huge! one order can feed two people. The has was excellent filled me up and my friend had to take his to go because his was a lot more than he could handle. Great place for when you and your friends are really hungry after a drunken night of partying and gambling.One of the best casinos in Las Vegas.  In a great location in Las Vegas blvd and beautiful to be in.  Has plenty of gaming, restaurants and a lot of visual stimulation.I had dinner there last night I ordered the prime New York strip it was very chewy and fatty definitely not prime I would not go backWent for breakfast. Prices are very affordable and the food is ok. If I were to go back though it would be more to support an independent restaurant over a chain rather than for the food. On the plus side, the vegetables in the omelet were generous even if it wasn't the best omelet I've had for breakfast.Hey Now!
  Our homey Casino. Lots of great VP and plenty of food offerings. Big rooms, most have been recently remodeled. Easy to score comps, near the strip too..
Very nice fitness room, big pool and hot tub.
 We love our host, Tammy Turner...
Going back for Memorial Day!
Last year's trip report:
http:\/\/flysrb.com\/Ti%20&%20RBs%202012%20Vega$%20Saga.htmlI really REALLY enjoyed our food here. Lorenzo, our waiter, was awesome and had a great personality. We came in during a convention in Downtown Phoenix and waited about as long as one would expect to. A miscommunication with the kitchen made out food and appetizers come out at the same time, quite a while after we ordered (again, busy night). 

All of these things are worth ignoring for the sake of the food, yet one thing was unacceptable. We were able to apply our $90 groupon to our food, awesome right? Exactly what they are for. But my friends who flew in from out of town, who I bought the lesser groupon for ($30) were denied the opportunity to use theirs. Not okay. Now they have a groupon for a restaurant in a state where they don't even live. I can't get a refund, and though we are frequently in Downtown Phoenix we won't be visiting this place again. 

I would also point out that when you ask your customers to wait outside in the heat, you may want to offer them water. Especially when the wait is 40 minutes in 116 degree weather. The last remark I want to make is that it bugged me that we waited that long, and then we were seated on the patio. There was no one out there, and there had been no one out there. Why in the world make us wait if you could have just seated us out there to begin with? We were the first and only ones out there. 

Lorenzo, again, you were awesome. Thank you for your hospitality, hopefully they treat you better than they treated us.A solid local spot that generally lives up to the high expectations that we have for a "Joe's" dining experience. Multiple visits have not failed to please, though one could ask for more consistently-diced Liberty potatoes--seems like there are a few undercooked, crunchy cubes on every plate. Finally, either the kitchen needs a refresher on what caramelized onions are, or the menu needs updating to reflect what's being sent out--SAUTEED onions. I'll be happy either way, but help me keep my expectations in line with reality!The walls are the color of cat puke, the floors feel like they've never been mopped, the whole place smells like feet, and to top it off there were people panhandling in the doorway with the employees doing nothing about it. I advise you to not eat at this Burger King as it is one of the most filthy and disgusting fast food places I have ever been to. This is the only BK near my house and the other one is 5 miles in the opposite direction, and I have been there once and will not come back. I am writing this for the warning of other people so they do not go here. Do not go here.Having heard nothing but great things, and with my foodie boyfriend in town for only one more night, I knew this was our best bet for a date night. We called several times earlier in the day, but couldn't get through. After booking a reservation elsewhere, I called one last time. I was told they had 48 requests for reservations overnight and a table was unlikely. They sensed my disappointment and offered to wait list us and call if something came up. An hour later they called with availability for 2. Yesss!
We arrived early and ordered a margarita while we waited for our table. The hostess recommended the Amber Margarita, it was a great choice If your looking to stick to the classics, not too sweet. One was enough. 
Now seated and keeping with our preference of asking waiters for recommendations, we ordered Guacamole Fresca and Ceviche of the Day (Marlin) as apps and Ancho Braised Brisket Tacos for him and Chile Rellenos for me. 
Our eyes were exceedingly bigger than our bellies. Next time we will share an entrée, or skip the apps altogether, but wanting to explore the menu as much as possible, we ordered and took a doggie bag for the next days lunch. 
The guacamole was good... fresh, flavorful and not too garlicky. The medium heat was more like mild, next time I'll give the hot a try. 
The ceviche was a little disappointing. Coming off a trip to San Francisco where I had excellent ceviche at Fresca for the first time, my standards were maybe a bit high. The blend was fresh and citrusy, with a great kick of heat. I would have preferred if the fish was more tender and not chopped into the same small cubes as everything else in the mix. Also, it might be because I got my tortilla fill on the guac, but I would have preferred the ceviche was served with plantain chips for variation. 
The tacos were some of the best I've had. Smokey and tender meat filled the flaky, soft shells. Served with their delicious seasoned rice, crema and salsa, it was the perfect Mexican meal. At least until we tried the oaxacan cheese stuffed rellenos. Breaded, fried, and placed on top of creamy tomato sauce, it was mouthwatering. With the rice, guac and salsa at its side, it was the perfect mix of flavours and textures. The only problem with this entree is that it made me regret ordering the apps because I could only have a few bites before feeling completely stuffed. 
I cannot wait to go back, intentionally order less, so I can fully enjoy my entire meal while it's hot and fresh. Service was good. The vibe is casual and cool, mixed with authentic Mexican decor.Friends gave Gord a gift certificate for his birthday for the Keg ... and we used it this evening.

We sat in the lounge by a fireplace.

While I had a glass of Riesling, Gord had a mojito.

Christina was our server and she started us off with some yummy bread ... it was crunchy on the outside and hot and soft on the inside.

 Gord ordered Mushrooms Neptune and said it was good.  As his main, ordered Chicken Oscar with Rice Pilaf.  He said it was good and he'd order it again.

I ordered BBQ Chicken and Ribs with Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes.   The ribs were okay ... the chicken and mashed potatoes were really good.

Christina was friendly and took good care of us.How is this place still in business? 
My friend wanted to go here for her birthday, since she is able to eat there even with a peanut allergy. 

Our server was totally disinterested in doing his job. From neglecting to take one of our orders, to taking 45 minutes to bring the drinks, everything about our server was terrible. The restaurant was not busy, he was not stressed, he just did not care. 

On top of all that, the cheesecake wasn't even good!From my past experiences at this buffet establishment, I would have to say with all brutal honesty, this restaurant is horrid outside, inside and its customer service. The place is so filthy... if you happen to look at the rafters above the general seating area, not the overflow room in the back, you would see that there's so much dust and clinging from underneath it, on top of it and all over the neon light strips installed above it. The bathroom could do better as well, it's not so well lit, at times the floor would be soaking wet in some spots, they could install better sinks with better faucets, the same could go with their toilets. Their hibachi\/ Mongolian Beef station could do with a better and competent cook. When I tell them to not add any spicy flavorings to my plate, they would do it anyway by way of not properly cleaning the skillet surface that they work on after each use. Their customer service could use a huge tweaking as well, by removing that "We Reserve the Right To Refuse Service to Anyone" sign behind their cashier booth and to properly re-train their servers to be polite and cordial to all customers. Remember the Customer is ALWAYS RIGHT! Their servers always have an attitude towards customers, which is wrong of them to have. I do understand that working as a server is stressful and annoying, however, they chose to work those position.

A list of cosmetic and service improvements I strongly recommend that this establishment should consider...

1. Improve the lighting in the restroom, by replacing the incandescent bulbs above the mirror with recessed LED light bulbs or fluorescent light tubes (I highly recommend LED light tubes).

2. Install new stall dividers\/ walls to remove the minor vandalism inside it. *Note: This would also force this establishment to close down or condense the restroom to the women's restroom for a couple of days*

3. Improve the seating throughout the restaurant with much more comfortable chairs and booths. 

4. Install auto flushers for their sit-down toilets and urinals, make their sinks and soap dispensers also sensor based as well. *Note: see number 2.*

5. RE-TRAIN their servers, re-train them on how to replace water that happens to be dirty and to NOT HAVE AN ATTITUDE with the customers. 

6. Either clean the rafters above the general population area of the dust and dirt that cling on to them or simply close it off with a drop ceiling. *Note: This would force this establishment to close down for a few days to a couple of weeks*

Those are some of the improvements that this establishment should definitely consider if they want to continue to have a good business and receive better customer reviews in the future. If not, they'll be closed down within the coming years and they'll lose their business license. They should really consider the customer experience over their definition an ethical business practice.

*ATTENTION*
To all future customers and reviewers of this restaurant, if you happen to look up at the rafters and look closely there you'll see how filthy this restaurant is, let that be your first impression of the place and everything about this establishment will fall into place.This is my go-to Chinese restaurant whether it's for dim sum, dinner or super late night munchies. I always make sure to order chicken and salted fish fried rice and\/or fried squid tentacles if I'm having dim sum. I can go on forever listing all of my favourites here but that would be almost the whole menu! Gotta give this place a try, if you haven't already3 Reasons Why Mamma Mia's Rules~!
The lunch price for two humongous slices and a small drink is $3.50 
The lobster ravioli is rich and creamy dreamy in a red pepper brandy cream sauce
The large antipasto salad is awesome and enough for 3 full mealsGreat Dinner - Meatloaf, BBQ Pork, Salad and Deserts were terrific!   Venue has a tremendous atmosphere, especially for the area.  This is a nice addition for dinner.
Some of the other reviews noted service as a bit lacking.  We found the service to be great.
The only reason that they do not have five stars is due to a fairly narrow menu offer.   
Given time and patron and owner patience Belmont and the surrounding community has a nice jewel added to the crown of independent dining choices.For the past year I've been singing the praise of Marino's to anyone who would listen.  Am I tad biased because of the fact I'm a life-long Dolphins fan?  I'll leave that up to you, but don't for a moment allow my fan allegiance to stand in your way of the most delicious ribs you might have ever had. 

Seems most of the negativity on the Yelp front comes from the fact people rolled in late.  I didn't experience this but can see where that might piss one off.  So from my all-you-can-eat Marino's extravaganza I can attest to the fact I stuffed myself properly.  

The 1st rack is huge and no we're not talking about the measly chicken ribs you'll find at the larger bbq chains (Outback I'm talking to you).  Each rib was struggling to hold onto its moist delicious meat.  I tore through the 1st rack and only got 3-4 ribs into the 2nd, which was a half rack before my gut called it quits and my wife rolled y across the street to our hotel.

Not to be forgotten were the delicious side orders.  I had the baked beans and garlic mashed potatoes both were fantastic.  Like the ribs, Marino's served up an endless supply. 

Lastly, the service was fantastic.  I say this due to the fact our waiter allowed us to take home leftovers, even though that's a bit of a no no with many all-you-can-eat offers and I had pretty much ordered a round of seconds with the sole intention of bringing them back to my room for a midnight snack.Pretty ordinary for an buffet. The food was standard for Vegas, and so were the prices. They had Snow Crab instead of King Crab (if that means anything to anyone). Price is about $30 per person for dinner, again, the norm around here. I would sum this up by saying this a very average Buffet.Really good home cooking meals with great service and fantastic pie!First off....NEVER AGAIN....Not only did the host seat people in front of us that arrived way after us, he blatantly lied to us about it.  Reservations for 7 pm were worthless as we watched a standing room only bar area with at least 15 to 20 people standingget seated, we 4 minorities the only ones not seated.  AlI witnessed at least 6 to 8 customers arrived 20 minutes after we arrived  get seated while we waited...did I mention we had reservations. A request for a manager resulted in us being informed that there wasn't a manager on a SATURDAY NIGHT. I can't critique the food because we never got seated. When it was obvious that we were leaving only THEN did we get an obviously obnoxious question asking if we were ready to be seated, we declined. If this is how customers get treated at Osaka, then 2 and a half stars are 2 stars too many. The app won't let me select NO STARS, so one will have to suffice.Love the variety and pizza, people are really nice too.I love the food and how supportive they are of the military. I like them better then old Carolina In Strongsville.Actually went out of our way to try this place, ordered a traditional poutine, cause we thought that's the classic, so it should the house special. Anyway it came out really fast which was nice, but it definitely didn't have enough cheese, it was mostly gravy. We also ordered a pop which was SUPER flat, which is really weird because it came from the bottle. However even though the food wasn't great the staff was very friendly, which helped make the experience a bit better for sure.New Summerlin location is close to my house and is right by the movie theatre so makes it a great spot for date night with my wife.  Every time I go, though, it never seems to be very busy?  Either way, I have yet to be disappointed with the food here, or the service for that matter.  

Banh Mi burger is fantastic, and what I get time and time again. I've been here about 5 times and the food is always consistent.  Burgers come out perfect, fries are crispy, appetizers arrive promptly, and the service is solid.  Some people will nitpick this place to death, but it's a really simple concept that's done well.

5 stars for a local restaurant with good food and service.I've been back a couple times for drinks.  The staff is always friendly and the beers are pretty good.  Some are better than others but all and all I haven't had one that was bad after trying a few flights. I have heard from a couple people that the food was pretty good so I figured I'd give it a try.

This last weekend I went back for a date night and actually had some food.  We ordered a chicken salad, a BLT, and a pretzel.  The salad was supposed to have a vinaigrette but it had a thick mayo like dressing that it was smothered in.  It was absolutely disgusting.  The BLT had a ton of mayo as well and a tomato jam that was for some odd reason sweet.  I've never had a sweet BLT and never want one again.  We scraped off the mayo and tomato jam and ate the bread, lettuce, and bacon.

After the first two items we tried to give them one more chance and we were still hungry.  We asked for a pretzel.  A pretzel surely couldn't be messed up.  Wrong.  It tasted doughy and mushy in the middle and came with two awful mustards.  One was worse than the next.  

We paid our bill and left literally with a bad taste in our mouth.  The waiter was a young guy who was nice and seemed new so I really didn't want to get into the food with him.  Looking back I should have asked for a manager.  The place was barely a 1\/3 full on a weekend so the owner should have a clue.  I am not sure if they are trying to overdo simple items or what but it don't get much more simple than a chicken salad, blt, and a pretzel folks.  

The chef needs to keep simple food simple.  I think this place could be a real gem if they could work out the food.  I'm really bummed about writing this review.  There's not a whole lot around here and this place had potential.  Not sure I'd come back now.  Best of luck.We put our name in a waited for a table, As I set and watched the host and waitress seat their friends and family before mine and another family.  
The host and the waitress will make you wait as they seat everyone they know, the whole time telling you that a table will open up any moment.
I walked out after an hour, We were the only people waiting for a table yet they sat everyone of their friends as soon as they walked up.
The cost is cheap and food is just ok, I will never step foot in this smoke filled place again.Finally, excellent sushi in Rock Hill! After two visits, post remodel and grand reopening, I can wholeheartedly recommend Fuji Japan and their sushi menu. They have not only modernized the interior, they have upped their maki and nigiri game to be the best in town.  Portions are generous, and the presentation for the dinner menu is fresh.  The staff is friendly, and with a very large dining room, I haven't had to wait for a seat.

Featuring all of the standard fare from tuna and salmon nigiri, to a wide array of maki rolls, every item I sampled was well prepared, flavorful, and expertly arranged.  The temperature was just right, and the maki were well rolled.  Wasabi and ginger were generously supplied, and just the right strength. Prices are average for above average food, making it a great deal.The buns are great! But the customer service not so much! Plus our order has been wrong several times...Good product is important yes! But no matter if your busy,short handed, whatever.. Customer service is key!Great experience for summerlicious ! The place looks amazing servers are all professional. Had the jerk pork for my appetizer, it was delicious! Pork was moist flavourful ! Great looking app too. My friend had the smoked trout salad, it was delicious too! I had the squid ink pasta with a garlic parsnip purée it was A1 too. Tried the fish dish it was bland and nothing special. Desserts are interesting... Black forest was moist , keylime pie was deconstructed and looks modern taste amazing too. Finished the meal with macaron complimentary. Worth the summerlicious . Regular price is on the higher end.I love Ryu Sushi. The food is fabulous but the service is even better. My family and I enjoy eating here about once a month. Always consistent!Love the location on Queen Creek Rd & Val Vista thanks for delish chicken tacos and awesome breakfast burritos!!!Don't Go there Was in on 3\/18\/2017 Been there many other times with no problem this time 
I went to get my husband a sandwich and while they were in the middle of making it a customer came and asked for the key to the bathroom with his gloves on he went and got the key handed it to the customer and proceeded to make my sandwich without getting new gloves on, when I questioned him that that was unclean he looked at Rebekah who was training him and said that it was ok they have new handles. Excuse me I tried to tell them it was a health issue they proceeded to make it I was dumbfounded paid then came right  back and said I want the sandwich remade.  Rebekah said I was wrong that the handles were brand new Some ones not trained right.  I called the Manager the next day and 3 days later and left 2 messages and never got a call back.  I complained to the website no one ever contacted me.  I will never go back poor customer service and they just don't care.
I went to other location near Smiths on Ann and they said nothing they could do each store has own owners.  No one cares so they lost us as customers we went almost every week no more!!I don't understand the hype.

I'm from Chicago, so good Italian food is a staple in our family. Upon reviews of this place from friends, I thought it was going to be my go-to, but sadly Taste of Italy is another mediocre desert restaurant.

The pizza was incredibly unimpressive. Greasy + tasteless. We ordered mozzarella sticks and they were soggy. Not to mention it's overpriced.

Still searching for that good Italian...Cool, modern atmosphere. Cramped but clean.

This isn't a typical banh mi shop. It's not even all that Vietnamese. More like Asian fusion.

We had the kimchi fries and 5 spice pork banh mi. Both were delicious. Pulled pork was an interesting ingredient in the kimchi fries. I'd rather they went with something that meshed better with the other toppings, like galbi or bulgogi, but it worked well enough. The banh mi had Korean pickled radish and some kind of red sauce (sriracha? Korean chili pepper sauce?) along with the other usual banh mi toppings. This was better than the kimchi fries for me.

All in all an odd but good marriage of flavors in the things I tried, and I''d definitely return to try the rest of the menu.Great food. Terrible service. Probably the worst I've ever had. Please train your staff correctly!Went for lunch. Fast, friendly service. Food was great. Decent sized portions and very affordable. Great atmosphere and very clean. Will be back for sure.Excellent customer service experience. This place is like California's Boiling Point chain, so if some of you know what I'm talking about, then you'll definitely appreciate the greater customer service at Pot Tea. We will come back just because of the excellent customer service because that's how big we are about it, especially when it comes to Asian restaurants. 

Food is good. We got the Stinky tofu hot pot and seafood hot pot. They were both really good. But the stinky tofu wasn't stinky enough. Lol. Fermented tofu isn't everyone's cup of tea so try at your own risk. Wish they had beer here. Lol. The popcorn chicken isn't bad. Everyone likes it so I would also recommend it. 

I can't wait to go back and try everything on the menu!Sunday April 30, 1:00pm-3:00pm -- What started out as a challenging 1-star experience **due to the hosts** turned out to be a super fun Sunday funday 4-star experience with our Denver volleyball team post-tournament weekend. After a chat with the manager Zack (Zach?), our experience went from awful to awesome on the patio... in the shade with great beers, food, service -- the complete package! Good times!I took my boyfriend to Mastros for his birthday as a surprise and both of us thoroughly enjoyed the entire evening! He said his porterhouse was one of the best steaks he ever had and we have dined all over the world. I had the Blackened Salmon and it was delicious! The only negative I have  is the scalloped potatoes were over cooked. The service and atmosphere were excellent.  The butter cake was incredible and served with ice cream and whipped cream that was phenomenal! We will be returning!Best Philly I've had in Vegas there French fries are crispy and seasoned well! I will definitely be back!Le Chalet est génial! If you don't speak French, that means it's awesome...and it is.  Crêpes, Fondue and ambiance.  Le Chalet has it all.  I have had the Fondue, and both savoury and desert crêpes.  All were wonderful.
If you're looking for a bit of the French Alps on a "stay in Phoenix" budget then put Le Chalet on the top of your list.Just started my cross country trip. Pittsburgh was my first train stop. Had a 3-hour layover. Seviche is very near the Amtrak station. Food is great. And the free sangria for checking on on Yelp was a nice addition. Thanks. 

Another thing I liked was being able to sit outside. It was a bit cold and noisy inside. It is crowded, but it is the weekend in the Cultural District. So I was not surprised at the noise level inside. Outside was great. And because it had just rained, the humidity has dropped; so it was a great experience.

I had the chorizo and serviche tacos. Both were very good. The deserts also look good, but I decided against indulging this evening. The Tequila Lime Cheesecake looked particularly tempting.AMAZING food!  everything we tried! Really cool space & great service, definitely on my list to visit again!Long wait. Inattentive waiter. Didn't see him once after he took our order. Had to get service from every other server than our own. Okay food - a bit heavy handed on the salt, although eggs were cooked perfectly.I can't even begin to explain how awesome this place is. 

The best I can do is say... Go there right now and get a hot dog. You won't regret it at all. You'll probably leave there with a second one under your arm.First Impressions
=============
A little chaotic, it was the weekend and people were zipping in and out. Tables at the time we're not cleaned and stuff was kinda left sitting around for a while. 

Food
====
Ordered Ramen & Donburi

Ramen:
A little under seasoned for my taste.  The Pork was good!  But the soup was a bit bland.  It was creamy, and the texture FELT rich.  And so it looked the part and it smelled the part, but when you put it in your mouth...the broth was a bit disappointing...

Donburi:
Good.  No complaints.

Drinks:
We ordered Coffee & Bubble Tea.  Coffee was good bubble tea--not so much.

Would I come back?
===============
If we were in the area I would not be opposed to giving it another go!Just grabbed a quick snack. The banana was good. Otherwise far from my favorite bakeryDelicious food and excellent service! Our waiter was exceptional and the ambience is delightful!Very nice new café in the area that specializes in the usual baked good but also some excellent Korean dishes. We had the Korean pancake for the kid, and the vegetarian Bibembop for us. All very good, but my wife noted that the dish was served in a regular bowl as opposed to a more traditional heated stone pot which helps to crisp up the rice. It was still good though. Coffee and cookies were tasty and fresh. The place is bright and spacious and very welcoming. Daisy the owner is very nice and helpful. We will go back.My husband took me here on a Friday night ...after hearing good things about it from coworkers.

We sat on the patio which had plenty of misters and overlooked a park, it was a very relaxing environment.

Our server, Carla, was as cute as could be and was so nice the entire evening. She was one of the most attentive servers that I have had in a long time. She was so genuine and really added to the experience that we had here...thank you Carla !!!

We ordered a bottle of red wine that the husband picked, I am not sure what it was but it was damn good ($23 for the bottle). As an appetizer we had the Piatto Misto, which was an assortment of Italian meats, cheeses, olives , and breadsticks ($14) and this is definetly enough for 2-3 people. The meats were excellent and the cheese was tasty also. My only recommendation would be for them to not cut the cheese into tiny little cubes...that was odd because the meat was sliced and you could not incorporate it very well.

For dinner we shared a pizza.. The Sofia..it had Scamorza (Smoked Mozzarella),Parma Prosciutto,Parmigiano Reggiano ($13). It was ooh soo tasty. We could not eat the whole thing...there was like 3 pieces that we ended up having boxed up.

Then we had dessert.....I am still in heaven just thinking about this dessert. It was the Dolce Della Casa...Slightly Charred Sweet Calzone
filled with Chocolate Hazelnut Sauce and Banana topped with Vanilla Ice Cream...OOOOOhhh my God. This was by far the best dessert that I have had in a while. It was so gratifying...I had goosebumps after the first bite. I would recommend ordering a small and sharing it because it was huge ($7). I can die a happy woman after that dessert...and if this was a first date ...that would have been a guarantee for sex !!! 

The community here in Verrado was absolutely amazing, I wish I would have known about this neighborhood before I bought my house in Goodyear. If you live nearby I would recommend checking this place out and spending time looking around the  neighborhood.Great place on the edge of Uptown. Service is friendly, food is freshly prepared, coffee is superb (get it before its gone)....

Breakfast is my fzvititr mesl and Tic Toc is a gemLocated at the Cosmopolitan Hotel, Holsteins has some amazing burgers. My friends and I ate here because we were gonna club at the Marquee next door and it had pink cow logo, which piqued my interest. It's a nicer burger place, so you should look presentable and not look hella grimey.

Food:
1) GOLD STANDARD - One of the best burgers I've had. Highly recommended. Aged beef sirloin with arugula, tomato, garlic-chive aioli. You can't go wrong with garlic aioli and goat cheese on a burger. I added a fried egg to it and it just made the burger so much more delicious.
2) DUCK FAT FRIES - Fried in duck fat, but doesn't taste all that different from regular fries. What made it unique was that it came with fried peppers and onions on top, which gave it a slight kick of spicy.
3) STEAK FRIES - the best steak fries I've ever had. I kept eating them even though i was stuffed. Well-seasoned and fried. I need to order more.. *drool

$11 Alcoholic Shakes:
1) FROZEN GRASSHOPPER - chocolate mint shake. It wasn't too minty and a little too sweet. Won't be ordering these overpriced shakes again.
2) OREO SHAKE - Much better. Very smooth oreo shake with alcohol. yummm.
Overall the shakes were good but way too overpriced. only half shot of alcohol.

Service: 5\/5 stars
Server was very friendly and was very knowledgeable about the menu. I find it annoying when servers don't know the menu well. We were strapped for time so he hurried everything for us, which was cool. awesome!This is one of the worst Tim Horton's I have ever been to. Despite a renovation to update the appearance they still can't get your order right. Almost half the time I go there they either give me the wrong item. Tonight I ordered two teas at the drive thru and when I got home it turned out they were both coffee despite being labeled as tea. Often this location is out of the item you want and take way too long to put your order together especially compared to many other Tim Horton's locations nearby. Do yourself a favour and go somewhere else for whatever it was you wanted.First off let me say I've ordered from here quite a few times and the pizza is great!  I hate that I'm leaving a review when it's bad but tonight's delivery order was very sub-par.  First,  my large chef's salad didn't come with the ranch dressing it was supposed to.  Second, normally I have to use two hands to eat this pizza due to being full of toppings and hot.  Tonight, it was barely warm and stiff, like it had sat out for awhile.  I WILL order from them again unless this happens again.Love this place! I have been going here for years for my pizza and it never disappoints. It can get busy when there are events in downtown Glendale, so I avoid it on those times only because it's just so busy. I can't speak for anything other than the pizza, because that is all I get when I visit.I went to China A GoGo around dinner time on a Thursday night and the place was pretty empty. They serve chips with sweet and sour sauce to start and one of the employees have us doughnuts on the house before our food was even ready.

I had the salt and pepper shrimp personal dinner, which was so much food for under $10. It comes with a soup, egg roll, crab Rangoon, half an order of shrimp and either white or fried rice. The serving was enough for two people. The shrimp was excellent, it was spicy and crispy. My party also got chow Kevin, orange chicken, honey walnut shrimp, and beef. All of our food exceeded expectations. For four people, our bill was around $50.

It is great to have such a nice place in that area with not a lot of food options up North! I will definitely be back again soon.Nice restaurant, clean and open. The Ladies working there are very nice.  Took a while for the order. (Cash only) There was only two people working.  One managing the cash and restaurant and one in the kitchen.  Order the #3 fancy fancy (bagel,lox,cream cheese, tomato, onion, capers, cucumber, alfalfa sprouts and fresh dill) Took about  5-10 mins to get my order.  The sandwich was delicious. Worth the wait.Good list of sushi rolls on happy hour, and good specials on drinks. The atmosphere was quite dead, but we got great service and loved our food.This pho place was tucked away at a corner plaza beside a jerk chicken. I must say I love their fresh assortment of lettuce and vegetable pairings. The pho is nice and hot with a big portion of meat. 

The appetizer was my least favourite part as we ordered the wrong one. I do wish to go back and try the crispy one in the fresh roll wrapping. 

Overall a great price for the food we got! We would definitely come back! There was a line up when we left so they must be popular with the locals.So have had my eyes on this place since we moved into town - FINALLY got the chance to go in last night!!!!

From the curbside, this place does NOT look like it holds a lot - but looks can be deceiving! The space is huge inside! And you can easily fit large groups in without a problem.

Single Buffet price is $5.49, then you pay for the drink on top of that. Those who are military - you basically get the soda fountain for free.

You can get the salad bar, pasta dishes, and of course the pizza's galore! You do have to fight the battle line at the buffet area. Getting past the battle at the line - the service is awesome from the staff! Staff are very quick to offer to make you a pizza if they see the piece you were going for is taken away before you get to it. Or if the pizza you wanted is not around, they will of course make it available to you.

My particular favorites last night were the spinach pizza (yup, I'm the female version of Popeye, just my arms don't get super big after eating it!), veggie pizza, and a herb pizza (had lots of italian flavors, with olive oil and garlic - VERY tasty). Cinnamon rolls were scruuuumptious! The brownies - eh - not my fav, but ok. And the dessert pizza - a little much on the sugar overload - but the cinnamon rolls were juuust perfect.

Staff are also very good at swinging by your tables to pick up the used plates, without disturbing the flow of your conversation with others. (They almost sneak attack in - but it's awesome how well they do it with hardly being noticed!) And when you get too caught up in the conversation - there are employees who are more than willing to come out carrying a pizza in tow fresh from the oven ready to serve you table side! They aim to please! And they will swing by your table to ensure you are happy about your service!

There is a back room - which is a mini arcade to entertain your ants in the pants little ones old enough to game.

It's not obvious where the restrooms are - ya have to look around - they are located in the arcade area.

Final verdict - fun night out for all!Our reservation was at 8pm, they welcomed us and sat us immediately. 
The atmosphere is beautiful, Its classy and hip.
The drinks took a little longer than average to get out.
Our server explains the menu and answered every question, she knew that menu like the back of her hand.
The food presentation was spot on, every dish came out looking pretty.
The food is very high quality, they don't compromise on that at all or take any shortcuts. There are a lot of very unique ingredients which was impressive.
The restaurant left an everlasting impression and I would highly reccomend it.I like this place. I've been here twice for togos and the food tastes great. I got the teriyaki bowl and chicken katsu\/chicken teriyaki plate. My boyfriend really likes this place and their sauce is one of the better ones. I received a coupon in the mail for a Buy one get one free entree so keep your eyes out for it.The worst wings ever. First don't serve Cornish hen wings. Ones with broken bones sticking out. If you do, don't water down the BlueCheese dressing. Just the worst. Worst.

Update:  To be fair, I did not give the establishment the ability to correct by bringing it to their attention. But...  multiple people were in the process of cooking and delivering the meal and were either uninterested or un empowered to send back if this was not the usual quality of the wings. But "Everything" was off including what tasted like ranch with blue cheese crumbled in it.  I was going to ask for the blue cheese that I ordered until I hit the crumbles. It was my first time there and from out of town.  Seems like a great place and could have other items that are of quality.Worst dinning experience in a while. I and my husband enjoy fine dinning in Las Vegas but this restaurant was truly horrible.

We went to this place after a Saturday show at the Smith Center. I ordered the Halibut dish, and my husband ordered the Ahi Tuna, along with 3 side dishes (Cream spinach, mashed potato and onion strings). Our friends ordered calamari for appetizer and prime rib and shrimp salad for main dishes. 10 minutes after our order, our waiter informed us there was no more Ahi tuna nor Halibut for the day. The only seafood they served was Tilapia, and per waiter it was supposedly sublime.

The Tilapia turned out to be super greasy and overcooked. And our friend's $61 prime rib was over cooked as well. All side dishes were tolerable, but definitely very greasy. We also had wine here which was not too memorable.

When our bill came out, we were surprised that they charged us each additional  $10 for "Oscar's top" which we did not order. Per waiter, it was the creamy sauce they placed on top of the Tilapia dish, which they did not tell us about in the first place. Since there was no Tilapia on the menu, the waiter went on to charge me $38 for my Tilapia dish, and charged my husband $41 for his. I have no idea why the pricing was different although we got identical dishes. Upon questioning, the waiter mumbled something, and since I don't like to argue in a high end restaurant we just paid and left.

I would not had given the restaurant 1 star had my husband not gotten so sick from the food the following day. My husband had nausea sensation for the following 24 hours, and some diarrhea. I also had mild nausea, but symptoms more mild. Overall, for a $80 per person meal, I can think of many other places to go toWe normally go to the Ohana's on Blue Diamond but decided to try out this location because we were in the area. Ordered Boba and was told it wasn't ready. Ordered Portuguese sausage eggs and rice. My sunny side eggs and sausage were way over done almost burnt. Never coming back to this location everGreat service. Food was delicious. The rice was really good.Went just before closing but was not hurried.Big time change in menu.......NOT good, Waitress told us not many people like it!!!.  Options are limited especially if you are vegetarian.  they did agree to fix a pasta for me, which was an OK dish.  
Lets face it Mimis is a old timers place and I can't image what they were thinking.
Awful choices and guess I'll find another place for comfort food.  Bad move--too many restaurants to choose from in Scottsdale.Fabulous restaurant. I'm in town this week for a conference and I went here with a friend who is local, we did the $40 three-course restaurant week menu.

You usually can't go wrong with Wolfgang Puck, so after looking at the menus online, I chose this place. I had seen it before on previous trips but had never dined there.

Busboy service was impeccable - my water glass was rarely empty, and the one time it was empty for a few minutes, the busboy came over and actually apologized which was over and above. Wait staff was friendly as well.

I ordered the tomato caprese appetizer, the grilled pork for my main, and tiramisu for dessert. Everything was fantastic although the tiramisu had more of a cheesecake-type quality; it could've used a little bit more coffee flavor and this is coming from someone who doesn't drink coffee.

My friend had a different appetizers, ravioli, and the pistachio pudding for dessert. She loved the pudding but said that you had to really like pistachio in order to like it.

Glad to know that there are other great Wolfgang Puck restaurants on the Strip, I've only been to Spago and maybe one other. Spago is one of my favorite Vegas restaurants but I'm adding Cucina to that list now too.I'm pretty picky about my iced coffee and this place does it right! We grabbed breakfast, the quiche of the day (bacon and cheese) and a breakfast sandwich (bacon egg and cheddar) on a croissant which were served hot and extra delicious! It was a pretty quiet Monday morning. The shop is bright and clean and the customer service was great! There's some art on the walls that you can purchase. We loved the simplistic decor with wooden tables and little succulents everywhere you look. They have a large table for meeting space and a comfy couch to relax in. Or if you're In the mood to sit at high countertops looking out the window, you have that too. I loved how they had the cream\/sugar\/utensils right next to where you pick up your coffee so you can fix your drink up any way you like!  The pastry case was full of yummy looking baked goods and it was so hard to resist! They also have a lot of grab and go drinks. Definitely will make this one of our normal coffee shop stops!My wife felt a craving for lamb while we were at the Kingsland Farmers Market for the Corn Festival, so she tried the lamb at Kaffir Lime, and voted it a solid two thumbs up. You know what they say--happy wife, happy life, and my wife is something of a lamb connoisseur, so I had to give them four stars. It would be five, except I didn't order anything for myself. That's for next time.Should try the salad here! Fresh and offering many options to choose. I don't like the soup here because the textures are a bit weird and was not as tasty as I wanted. the Pull pork sandwich was okay but I might or might not order again cuz i don't get much impression for this first try unfortunately. Will be back here if I'm hungry since it's just right on my way back home from school everyday.I am writing to share that I just had extremely negative experience at your location.  I arrived early to meet colleagues for lunch with my laptop in tow as usual. I actually arrived at about 11:11, or at least that was the time when I reached the back counter to order food. I attempted to order a breakfast sandwich and I was told that breakfast was over. So, I decided to sit and wait on my three lunch companions to arrive and order with them.  I arrived early and to do work prior to their arrival to make sure to snag a table for four people since there are only three tables inside that seat four people.  

I settled in and then had some women who works there asked me if I could move so that people who were there for lunch could get a seat.  She said that she was asking everyone on a computer to move to a single seat.  I then explained that I  had three people meeting me.  She then asked is they were meeting me for lunch 3 times and I answered "yes".  Let me be clear that it was like was asking a child and not the customer.  She asked to the point that it was accusatory and uncomfortable. Then, as I thought I made myself clear she said "ma'am" again as if I needed to move and I sad I have three people meeting me here for lunch. And she said again "for lunch?".  It's then that I decided to text everyone and go to a restaurant where I don't have to stake out table and then be harassed to move.  I have now spent hundreds of dollars on lunch, dinner, coffee, wine, and beer.  I shared with people how great the location is. I have told them to meet me there for lunch, dinner, coffee, wine, and beer.  It's a disappointment and disgrace to be treated with such disrespect.  It's unfortunate that money doesn't buy one respect.It is official - we have new favorite restaurant in Phoenix.  Hands down, Joe's Midnight Run is the best mix of unique menu selection, outstanding food quality, notable cocktail and beer list, excellent service and overall enjoyable atmosphere in the valley.

The restaurant has an open kitchen concept with full seating around the line, offering a front row seat to the eye candy that the chef and his staff are pushing out each night.  Seriously, just the creative and artistic presentation of these dishes is enough reason too come to Joe's and sit on the line while you eat.  I'm sure that the tables and booths are also nice, but I cannot imagine sitting anywhere else, if given the choice.

It was my birthday, so we were there to eat, and to drink.  We arrived early (around 5:30) and were happy to find an incredible happy hour - $2 off all menu items.  The menu offers some truly impressive small plates and entrees, and because it was our first time there, we opted for variety, ordering a large volume of small plates to try as much as possible.

We got a few very cool cocktails, then laid into a wide range of small plates.  They were all generously sized and served with complimentary sides.  The grilled octopus was done perfectly - tender and fresh, well seasoned and served with spiced potatoes.  The skirt steak with marinated peppers and chimichurri was my wife's favorite.  Well portioned, medium rare and flavorful.  We got the flash-fried shishito peppers which are a huge pile of peppers served with a delicious lemon garlic aioli dipping sauce.  The large portion of bone marrow was cooked just right with a little sea salt and some crusty bread.  My favorite of all were the sweetbreads.  I am a huge sweetbread fan, and preparation is everything.  They can be really good, or really bad, and these were the best I've ever had - anywhere.  They were the perfect temperature with a light white wine caper sauce that was subtle and complimentary.  We also got the cantina poutine.  This was another great dish, topped with chorizo gravy and mahon cheese, but it is a HUGE portion, and we simply could not finish it.  When we come back, I would order this by itself with drinks.  But in the context of the other plates, I'd rather go with the more esoteric menu items.  In summary - WOW.  You just don't find those kind of dishes in Phoenix, especially in fun atmosphere like this.

In the background I had several beers from their strong beer selection, largely focused on local AZ craft brews.  My wife had a few more cocktails.  And although we forgot to order it, you can get a 40oz bottle of King Cobra malt liquor with your meal.  Awesome.

A few words about the service.  Our server was outstanding.  Helpful, friendly, attentive, and just a pleasure to have around.  He was supported by several other teammates who were constantly assisting him with the many dishes that we ordered.  They recognized that it was my birthday very early on, and went far out of their way to make our first time in, and our night in general, extremely memorable.  We spoke to the chef several times, and all of the line cooks were interactive and friendly while they worked in the hot kitchen.  The manager also came over to speak with us, which brings me to dessert.

I've already stated that the sweetbreads were the best that I have ever had, and our outrageous dessert at Joe's is the second dish that met that criteria.  At the managers suggestion, we had the tart tatin, an apple dish that is already phenomenal, but was made extraordinary with the addition of a healthy slab of foie gras right in the middle.  The pairing was surprisingly ideal, with the foie melting into the apple tart, and a side of vanilla ice cream to top it off.

So when we return to Joe's Midnight Run, it will be for so many reasons.  We cannot wait to try their brunch, bring our friends, and work our way through the rest of this unique menu.  The valley really needed a place like this.  Great job.I hosted my birthday dinner of about 8 or 9 ladies here and booked the reso very last minute as there was a cancellation\/ reservation mix up at the Broadview hotel where I initially planned it. KOST was honestly so much better (I later went to the Broadview which I loved also)(( but you can read their review at another time haha)). This is a great place to get a bunch of items to share because everything is so good!!! Their service is also impeccable and the view is stunning! Located on the rooftop of Torontos boutique hotel Bush's, KOST is a must try! Pictured are a few of my favourite items!! The tuna ceviche and pico di galo  happy eating.Small but not crowded spot with the kind of sweet brrakfast treats i crave.
Slow on delivery but worth the wait. Friendly staff with a quiet atmosphere.I've been coming hear regularly since I moved to dormont last year and haven't seen any of the issues with a rough crowd the other reviews have spoken of. I've always had great service and there drinks are cheep. Especially the pens game pitchers.Came here for brunch after a friend's recommendation. Best French style cappuccino I had during our stay in Las Vegas, as well as a lovely Pinot Noir. Food was fantastic. I'm only giving a 3 star rating because our waiter screwed up my husband's order and had to wait additional time for the correction. Plus his eggs were not cooked to his requested preference. Maybe next time service will be up to par? Would definitely give a second chance.If you've ever watched Goodfella's and remember the ending scene where Henry orders Italian while living in rural America I can say I just lived it. I ordered what was supposed to be chicken parm over ziti and paid $18 for a small portion of generic macaroni covered in cheap jar sauce topped off with dry chicken.. Not sure how they call themselves the "Streets of New York" because growing up in Jersey I've had better Italian food in Irish restaurants.Either someone read my previous comment, or enough people complained about it, I got both my salad dressing and sauce in the bag tonight...without even asking!  Plus the food is still dynamite.When I was in town I used to love to come here and order the Bleu Cheese Filet. Always done right and tasted great. The filet is always wrapped in bacon and comes with big garlic cloves. Very tasty!

The restaurant had sort of an "uppity" wannabe feel to it...but all the service was still polite. Prices were a little high, but that kept with the uppity vibe I guess.

Oh yeah, I had some type of 3 part desert. That was awesome as well.

Only four stars for the uppity vibe and high prices. Everything else was great.The chicken biryani and beef kebab taste amazing and are a must if you eat here. Other items that taste good are the goat haleem, chicken wings, beef biryani, and beef burger. Prices are affordable and I will definitely come back when I am in Phoenix again iA.It's nice to know that places like this still exist. It's really a throwback experience and an original one at that. Set aside the food and the menu for a second and you still have a terrific vibe. I haven't seen a live polka with accordion since hector was a pup! I could walk around this place for hours just admiring the photos and history. I imagine that this place has stories that would make the Vegas Stories Hall Of Fame!
   We came in with a party of 8 and I think this is THE place for a group. The menu is all inclusive. The price on the board includes a main course, an appetizer, a side salad or soup, dessert and red or white wine. You're not going to leave with an empty stomach! Once your seated and comfortable, I suggest you start looking around. There's local memorabilia from floor to ceiling. It's worth walking around the halls, just to catch a couple "oohs" and "aahs"!
   We eventually put in our order and the meal started to unfold course by course. The carafe of wine and garlic bread came first and the table got instantly happy. The bread was warm and delicious and with the red wine flowing, the mood started to really lighten up. The salad came out and we started to nosh even more and talk less. It was a standard Italian salad with big chunks of salami. It tasted great and to have garlic bread with Italian salad is an amazing start to a meal. The bread, salad and wine and company were all part of a joyful experience. This polka guy came by and gave us a happy medley to lift our spirits even higher. 
  I order the chicken parm and when it arrived it was cooked through with the texture remaining crisply while the cheese and sauce was still sizzling from the oven. The side of pasta was standard with a simple red sauce. I'm really happy with my choice and even happier with the location and the experience we had. I was treated like family by all the wonderful people at Battista's. If you want an original or non cookie cutter meal, this is it! It's truly one of a kind!Hi i came in for happy hour tonght and i hesd rnr classic hamburger with cheese and potatoschips and water to drink and it was happy hour so i played halfprice on my Mill that i eat tonight on this visit the food was good services was good and it was not to busy win i came in to eat tonight thankyou Riley for serving tonight you did good hop to see you aging on my next visit ok i will be back soon to eat have good evening ok thankyou.Awesome food and staff. The building is incredibly beautiful and well laid out. 
I truly enjoyed having a "personal chef" prepare my food with me and being able to sit anywhere that I wanted. It seemed complicated at first, but the host explained everything to me and it was lots of fun to use the chip card.
 I had  the Pasta Bolognese and it was excellent. I'm shocked at the amazing drink specials $3.95 for Peroni on draft? AWESOME. 

 I was there for their first night of business and very impressed with everything except the music selection and that it was way too bright., A spot so lively should have a better selection of music that caters to the 30 something crowd. My suggestion is older rock and some 80's hits thrown in, that would make my friends and I stay for a few more Peroni's. 

But overall a really great experience, I'll be back.Decent cheap Chinese. The cream cheese wontons are great! I like it better than Panda Express and it's cheaper.Had delivery and it was good. Veggie mu shu had good flavor and lots of pancakes. General Tso's  tofu was fine, but wasn't as crispy as I like it. Really nice veggie lo mein, however. Fast delivery. Much better than any other Chinese take out around here.Everything we ordered are very flavorful. Everybody here were nice and tentative, not annoying or fake. They took their time to explain everything and how it works. I like it how they also have chicken siomay, we don't eat pork so its good to have other option.Their dimsum price are slightly higher on the weekend and holidays. They have a lady walking around pushing dimsum cart, she has all selections of steam ones but if you want any fried dimsum or veggie you can walk up to the counter to see their selections and order from there or order it from your server.

Good dimsum, clean. We'll be back!I love this place!! You can call you order in ahead of time and it will be ready when you get there. I have had the Gyro combo and it is amazing! The combination of the lamb and the beef is fresh. They put tons of meat on your gyro.  Tons of tomato and onions, along w\/tahiki sauce- made fresh.  Good french fries are nice and crispy on the outside and soft and tender on the inside.

We have also tried the chicken shawarma combo. It is moist and spicy. We go every Friday for this lunch.  You can even call in for delivery.

The staff is wonderful and friendly. They are quick to explain the different items that are on the menu.  You can tell them the type of thing that you like to eat and they will make recommendations. Awesome place!!!Just stopped in for the Prix Fixe lunch. Yum Yum! Great value. $11.99 for 3 courses. I had the mango mandarin salad and the butter Chicken supreme which was excellent. The portions looks small on the giant plates but are definitely filling. I had to take my blueberry tart to go. Will be going back...soon. Looking forward to trying the other items on the menu, but it will be difficult not to order the butter chicken.Had a delicious dinner. Chefs were about to accommodate my dietary restrictions. Very impressed with all substitutions. Waitress was amazing. Even offered breadsticks with no butter & garlic. She went above & beyond to check ingredients on my meal.So 808 doesn't accept yet Groupon during lunch...it doesn't state that clearly state that on the Groupon but that's okay. 

However I called 808 because my Groupon had expired and I wanted to make sure that what I spent could still be used during lunch and I was assured I would be able to use the  value of what we spent (I was on speaker and my wife confirmed she heard the same thing). Upon arriving the clueless waitress said " I explained that you can't use both." I wouldn't have drive here across town if you would have explained that....

This is the third time something like that has happened...we will not be back!!What's not to like?
It's close by (convenient), owners are very personable, and the coffee is good!

You can text ahead w your order and just dash in to pick up. 

Best wishes for successThe food was cold as if it had been sitting in the kitchen and then served.I was there for approximately 7 minuets before I requested a refund. I tipped my waitress upon leaving as she was very pleasant.For a chain restaurant, this location had quite a few things down.  Polite hostess, efficient & quick seating, good server, and a menu that changes a little every so often.  Soups & salad are dependable, though many of the entrees are heavily American skewed with all of the massive cheese & fried options.  This place has a niche in chain-dining that won't go away - the soup\/salad lunch deal, those quirky breadsticks, the chocolate mints at the end, etc.   Lot of family dining here, and across a broad spectrum of demographics.  Never had bad meals at an OG, but nothing spectacular either.  This location though is among the better OG's I've found.  It sure as heck beats many "local" places with surly waiters and bad parking.Looking for an alternative to Starbucks?  Look no further than these guys from Vancouver, BC.  Inside, it looks like your typical Starbucks but 1-larger space, more tables, more elbow\/leg room 2-painted red instead of green 3-lower prices 4-staff very laid-back, customers don't feel rushed to place orders.   Spanish Latte is their signature drink and it was delicious; they use condensed milk so it is already perfectly sweetened as served.  Also their espresso beans are not roasted nearly as dark as Starbucks so if you don't like the "burnt" taste of the Green Monster's espressos, Artigiano will be a pleasant experience for you. Highly recommended.I had the Britannia burger and Pamesan\/Truffle fries.     Excellent burger, fries were OK, a little too dry for my taste .  Expensive, but that was expected.  Service was slow, for a late lunch (3:00pm).  Cool atmosphere, and presentation.This is a solid place for fast food and reminded me a lot of In-N-Out with a variety of frozen custards available. 

The burgers are shaped very thin but also are spread wide. The fries are thin cut. The appearance of the meal gives Freddy's a unique characteristic to remember it by.

The frozen custards come with a large variety of toppings, which is the main draw. However, if you are just looking for frozen custard and not the burgers, I would recommend venturing down the street to Nielson's for some frozen custard that will make your taste buds explode.We love to try lots of different food options in Vegas, including Indian.  We're pretty sure we've found a contender. The host\/server Eric was awesome & really made our night.The food at Mastro's is amazing as always, but unfortunately after we got our food and the service kind of went downhill.Awesome service and food! If you stick to one thing, get the Mac and Cheese! Yeah sounds simple enough, but very complex and tasty! Not to sound like a snob, but coming from someone visiting from New Orleans...it's worth a taste or two.I found this place tucked away in a little strip mall after reading a couple other reviews on yelp. Upon walking in for a late (2pm) lunch, I was warmly greeted by the owner. I had intended to get a large Greek salad and a lamb kebab but he explained the plates to me and saved me a few dollars. I ended up with a Greek side salad, side of rice, a large portion of lamb schwarma, pita bread, baba ganoush, and hummus, with a drink. 
I was hesitant about the baba ganoush- I have had it at many other restaurants and found it to be bitter or too garlicky. This was outstanding, literally the best baba ganoush I have ever had anywhere! I commented I the owner on its deliciousness and he brought a freshly cooked eggplant to show me that he had indeed made it fresh while I waited. Let me again emphasize I was the only person in there!  The food took a little while to come out, but it really wasn't that bad considering that he made everything right then himself. I was delighted with the friendly owner and his exceptional culinary skill. He brought me free Turkish coffee and was going to sit down and drink coffee with me but he got another customer. The food was the best I have had in a while and even better was the owners exceptional hospitality. I love feeling welcome in a restaurant and genuinely want to come back again and again. Seriously you should go here.Leaving North Carolina and kids wanted to eat here and I must say it was worth it.  The restaurant was clean and the people were friendly. The food was fresh\/hot and out in a timely manner.  Hamburger was delicious and they even made a spacial salad upon my request. Wish there were more of these in the South (South Carolina)I absolutely love eating here, they have great hospitality and every time I go I have my food out in a matter of seconds! I love the spicy chicken sandwich and the nuggets are always delicious. They have the best lemonade and sweet tea. I've tried the chicken minis and they are so good! They have honey on the bun and the chicken biscuit is one of the best options to get in the morning! Don't forget to ask for some chick fil a sauce while you're at itYEAH, 
For once, a real mexican restaurant !
Not like all those american-mexicans cheap ones (Carlos & Pepe's, 3 amigos or El Zaziumm).
They serve tapas version of their typical meals.
Seriously, it's delicious and full of flavours.
The service is very personalized and it might be because the restaurant's size;
it's very small.
You feel like you're a guest at their home.
I've been there 3 times and I'll go back anytime.I've only been for brunch but it was amazing. Fantastic, attentive servers and imaginative, well executed dishes.Dog friendly times ten! I am a regular at this restaurant for their Happy Hour specials, which they have every single day. I like that the patio is open seating and you can sit wherever you like. I never have a wait time when I go to this restaurant (even on Mother's Day!). 

Their pet policy is that dogs are welcome as long as they don't cause a problem. My dog is very relaxed, so I'm lucky, but they go above and beyond to make even his experience pleasant. He gets his plastic cup of water and the passer-by's stop to tell him how cute he is and pet him as he sits on the ledge of the patio. 

It really is the perfect spot for a weekly Happy Hour where you can relax and enjoy the Vegas weather. 

The San Francisco lemonade mixed drink is phenomenal but he sangria martini had WAYY too much sour.  Typically their drinks are spot on and I'm always a fan of the $5 mixed drink specials.

As for appetizers, the baja tacos (in fish or steak) are super good and I get them every time I'm there. Occasionally, I'll get another appetizer dish and so far the only appetizer I was unhappy with were the potstickers.

There can be a bit of a lag time when it comes to the servers, but their fantastic service more than makes up for the wait. Kudos to the management and the staff!First time visiting, brought my husband and brother. Pho was delicious just like I have had in Virginia. Summer rolls were good too. I think I got my brother hooked on the noodle soup since he had never had it before and already wants to go back.I have been at this place several times.  They've got an awesome Monday happy hour that includes pizza, wings, beer and other stuff.  I gotta say, the pizza is much better when you don't get it on happy hour b\/c they just reheat slices with new topping on top during happy hour.  But the wings...coming from someone who is picky about wings...they are what keeps me coming back again and again.  

I think this place is family run and not related to another Grimaldi's in Scottsdale.  

Overall, this place is pretty nice on the inside, but can get kind of crowded b\/c it is small.I've been to the Cornish Pasty Company in Tempe many times.  First time at this location was pretty bad for several reasons. First, the place smelled bad upon walking in. Sorry, it smelled like sewage. I've worked at many restaurants. Second, the church pews we sat in were filthy. No excuse. Third, a small roach scampered off the side of the table when I sat down. I had to flick it onto the floor and forget about it.

Yes, I actually stayed and ate. The food was excellent, but I won't be visiting this location again.This place is on point. Simple but not really. Had beef wrap, amazing! Staff is very friendly, good food, will return.Pretty good food (one dish served cold). God-awful service, one woman worked her tail off while 2 others (guess sex) twiddled on their dumb phones. They also messed up the seating arrangements for a large party.Came here for a midnight snack since this place is near my boyfriend's place and opened until 3am! He ordered the Lengua burrito with the green hot sauce and I had a large horchata. The Lengua burrito was all Lengua and some salsa! That's a whollllleee lot of meat for $7! The green sauce goes well with it and I mostly like the burrito's tortilla wrap because it was thin enough to not be the filling part of the meal. I didn't like the Horchata however because it was really diluted :\/ and for $3. A good drunchies spot and late night snack.I am in Phoenix on business, and this was the closest Chinese carry-out to my hotel.  Best I've had in a LONG time.  The Spicy Chicken featured tender white chicken, fresh tender-crisp vegetables and a tasty light sauce that didn't overpower the dish.  I highly recommend Hsin Cafe, and may go back tomorrow before heading home to North Carolina!  CompetitiverobThe food was really good and was made fast! My only concern is the size if the egg rolls. They were more along the size of a spring roll. Other then that, I enjoyed the taste, quality and quantity of it! Good job!!Ok so look at that big ass piece of chicken in the photo I attached to this review. Holy cow, or shall I say holy chicken! That freaking thing was massive! You know how you normally have bread left and run out of meat? Well no not the case here. I ran outta bread before I could finish the chicken! That sandwich had to have been the best Nashville fried chicken sandwich ever. It was juicy, spicy, and just had the best flavors. 

The service was excellent. We got our order in, drinks served, and order delivered in a timely manner. We went on a Thursday during the late afternoon. It wasn't too busy. It was nice and air conditioned too. There were plenty of tvs and a nice long bar up at the front of the restaurant. It's in the newly renovated downtown section of Fremont street. Definitely worth a bite to eat here.Typical americanized mexican food. We ordered queso, quesadilla and steak fajitas. Plenty of food and everything was tasty. I know some of the other reviews said they have bad service but I've been here twice and both times they were super friendly and working really hard to make sure we were having a good meal. Only 1 waiter for about 10 tables but he was busting his ass and did a great job. I live right down the street so I'll be back.Mmmm...this place is good. I love their orange chicken. Good prices and the people are super friendly. Anything with shrimp in it is great.The food is horrible with no taste. We ordered over $40 worth of food and they got several items in the order wrong and wouldn't replace anything.  If they were the last place opened in Vegas, I wouldn't eat from them ever againSo many healthy menu options. Great place for a family or just as a couple. Very clean and plenty of options.Chevy's has amazing freshly made tortillas, but watch out because they're tiny and each one surprisingly contains 167 calories. They also make great quesadillas but only if they're made on their homemade tortillas. Their margaritas and desserts are also delectable, especially the little cinnamon-sugar tortilla cones with vanilla ice cream. I always had a blast here as a kid when they gave you a free sombrero on your birthday.WHAT do you mean you have been in operation for 15 years and I didn't know about you.  I failed FAILED AS A FOODIE, it took me 15 years to find Alize, but now I know where it is!!!

This is one of the best French restaurants I have been to, and since I love French food I have been to many.  Let's start with the view.  You are on the 56th floor of The Palms, with a vista to the entire Vegas skyline.  The views are spectacular.

Next lets discuss old school European service.  The kind that keeps me running back to europe, the kind that has been forgotten in the US.  Where wait staff master the art of their trade and this is their career and take great pride in it.  That is the staff you will find here.  Class and elegance throughout the entire dinner experience.

Then we have the food.. OMG the food.  This is French cuisine, but it has a slight Mediterranean twist to it.  Possibly a nod to the Maloof family, but definitely a successful twist.

Hubby ordered the escargot as a starter and the rack of lamb as his entree.  I ordered the seared foie gras as my appetizer and the veal wellington for my main.  I also ordered a Grand Marnier Soufflé at this time, because it takes 25 minutes to prepare.  We were served a delicious amuse bouche and choices of bread.  Of course beautiful european butter sat in the center of our table as well.  Everything was delicious.  Chef sent out another pre course, the most beautiful tiny panna cotta with apricot puree and blackberry.  ALL of this was so good, the panna cotta was divine.

Then our appetizers arrived, so beautiful to look at. I was shocked at how generous of a portion my foie gras was.  It was cooked flawlessly and it was paired with fruit and cream and I enjoyed every bite of it.  Hubby ordered the escargot, which are served on bone marrow in the bone and topped with garlic herb butter (emphasis on the herb), heirloom tomatoes and garlic chips.  He was in love.  Our staff, without prompting, brought out the bread tray for him.  They recognized that the escargot required something to sop up all the gorgeous sauce and marrow.  Neither of us left a drop of food, it was that good.

Then our main entree arrived.  Presentation is everything and they know how to present.  As soon as the domes were removed we both went OOOOO AAAAA, and looks were not deceiving, they tasted as wonderful as they looked.  My veal wellington was tender, so flavorful and delicious.  Unfortunately I had filled up on bread and pre starters and starters and could not finish my meal, but it wasn't for lack of trying.  This was exceptional.  Hubby didn't speak through his meal, but he kept saying mmmmmm.  He is a lamb chop snob, because in all honesty he makes some of the best I have ever had, and he was floored with his dish.  He would have never put this mix together, but he loved it.  His lamb dish comes with a small falafel, a kefta sausage and it was covered in an apricot sauce.  All of this worked magically together and really complemented the lamb (he wanted to make sure I said that, lol)  Let's just say, it was a huge hit and he's already planning our next visit to Alize.

Dessert is NOT to be missed.  No one does it like the French and Alize is very French.  My soufflé was sublime.  Light, airy and delicious.  I wish I had more room in my belly to finish the whole thing.  Hubby had creme brûlée and he didn't share.. LOL

Do not let the fact that this restaurant is not on the strip stop you from going.  It is worth the 4 minute drive, your mouth and eyes will reward you kindly.Beware of the fines for dining there! My wife and her family and I tried their unlimited sushi evening. While the food is ok our service was really slow and arrogant.  What really infuriates one the most is they fine you ( charge extra ) if you do not finish the little left over rice on your plate!! Only dine here if you like to pay fines!!  We will not be returning to this place!Blew me away! The service (Melissa) was amazing, the food though was to die for! Can we take a moment to mention portion sizes? I don't think they know what those are because everything is giant! No complaints here though because it is all so dang delicious! 100% recommend this place!This is a great little place on the second floor of the Luxor. The happy hour brought us here as many of the other options in the Luxor changed up their HH menus. The food was great and was priced very fairly for a strip location. Drinks were decent and some imported beers were only $5. Service was good even with our large party. Would visit again if we're in the area.Been to vegas several times. Stayed in a different hotel each time, but this was definitely my favorite. Hotel is amazing. Rooms are fab and casinos are great. Highly recommend.Although I've never had a bad experience at any Port Of Subs this is my favorite location. This location is always clean, the food is always fresh, especially the bread:)!!! What I like most about this location is the staff, the staff here are able to take your order, make your sandwich and have a friendly conversation with a  very good timing . Love this locationQuite good place for brunch. Although there are better spots in Montreal, this is a good one in downtown. Food was great and so was the service.Very disappointed with my dining experience.  The staff was way to ready to close and it was only 910, they don't close til 10.  The food was pretty old and not very good.  I am usually very satisfied with this location. Not sure what happened tonight.Yes yes all of the yes!!!

Before i get into the food, let me start off by saying that the little tappas buffet inside the restauant was on FIRE!!! They are famous for their jamon donut...and i gotta tell ya.... it was ridiculous. Crazy good!

The menu has lots of vareity and everything was excellent. The tomato bread is decent (needs a little more salt in my opinion) but what do i know,i like everything over seasoned hehe

Some great minds put this menu together and im happy i get to have eat it all! Also awesome that  they are open from 8am to 2am daily so i can get my bar raval fix at any time of day!  Woohoo!I'm not generally a huge fan of the PTs chain, but this particular location is a big exception. Manager\/swing bartender Jen makes it into a fun Zander engaging neighborhood hangout.

Food is fine, not special, but decent bar food. Drink selection is solid, though not overwhelming. If you come here, it's for good treatment and good company.I feel bad that we did not get our server\/bartender's name - she was AMAZING! It was literally some of the best service we've EVER had anywhere!
Went for lunch mid-week with a Groupon. Much to our delight, the menu was more "gastro-pub" than bar food. Such a pleasant surprise.
The gal who served us took such great care of us and made sure our experience was as stellar as the food.
WE WILL BE BACK OFTEN! Can't wait to bring friends along next time to share this awesome place.There is a special place in my heart for treasures. Whether it's th poorly done buffet with drinks and hot girls or the stories from Lolita of the home country, I've never had a bad time.During our nightmare Fremont experience (see my review for Fremont street experience for details), we stopped by this place for lunch. 

Ambiance: 2\/5, it embodies the vibe of Fremont street: old and unkempt. It looks more like a fast food joint than a restaurant. They need to turn up their AC because it was still warm inside. 

Food: 3.5\/5, overall tasty but nothing special. It would be nice to get crispier fries though. The food came out in a reasonable time after ordering. Decent prices ($7.95 for a burger and fries, $11.95 for a chicken kebab plate with cous cous and hummus) given Vegas restaurants jack up their prices. They serve Mediterranean salads, pita wraps\/kebabs, burgers, and panini sandwiches. 

Service: 2\/5, the young lady who works both as the cashier and waiter couldn't care less about being there. She interrupted us ordering our food to go serve food to other guests seated and did not smile, say hello or ask us if we need anything else.I have two kiddies and they love this place. I however, am not as excited about it as they are. The food was so-so and still more expensive than I would've liked. There's all sorts of "kid traps". Light-up glasses and an entire gift shop full of more over-priced items. On the plus side, there's a mechanical crocodile just outside the restaurant. If your kid is young enough, you can always use that crocodile as collateral . . . . . "If you don't finish your food, that crocodile will get mad". "If you don't behave that crocodile is going to come over". You know, things like that which we may or may not have said to our son. - insert evil grin here-Oh guyyyys "Locovorium"? For realllllll? 

BUT bright, airy, great patio, quiet residential street, good sandwiches, *cucumber water*, nice coffee, good cookies, etc. Very nice staff, reminiscent of your 'cool counsellors' from that camp where everyone knew all the words to "Venice is Sinking". 

I like it better than Saving Gigi or The Common (fairly proximate) because largely, the clientele seem to be 30-40sthg work-at-homers in the neighbourhood, instead of vaguely bitchy 16-32 y\/o homeworkers-at-coffeeshops. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is I'm afraid of my own generation. 

CONCLUSION: Bean sprouts eternal...?One of the best south indian restaurant in Toronto (Vegetarian).. I'm a meat lover but this vegetarian restaurant get 5 starts easily for its authenticity.. I taste south indian food in different restaurants in toronto but nothing compare to nilgiris.. I prefer not to go to indian restaurants in toronto because I worked in few so I know if its fresh or some reheated spicy sause crap.. I strongly recommend this place.. its better to go for buffet so cheap to try different south indian varieties.. keep in mind its south indian food (mild \/ medium spicy) .. its not some local sweet butter chicken naan joint.. reason I give 4 star is the line up during lunch buffet is long but its worth a wait..Petite Maison truly deserves fives stars.  The last time I tried to explain my experience here, I did not go into detail about the food or ambiance, all I could say was " there are true chefs working in that kitchen, not trained cooks calling themselves chefs".    The cocktail I started off with reveals the nature of this restaurant.  The Cyrano de Sazerac, obviously a play on Cyrano de Bergerac is a concoction, so perfect in its simplicity so French and at the same time so American.  Sazerac is a brand of American Rye whiskey, and "The Sazerac" is also a cocktail with a history dating back to pre Civil War New Orleans.  Originally the drink was made with French Brandy  but later rye whiskey was used due to the phylloxera epidemic that destroyed France's wine grape crops.  Absinthe is the other half of this drink, and what could be more French than that?

I started with the Beouef Tatar, completely raw beef ground to the point where it just barely held its puck like shape.  On top was an egg, sunny side up, cooked just perfectly, a tap of the fork, and the yolk was released all over the beef.  On the side, crisp deep fried pomme natrual.  I have never had beef, potato and eggs quite like this, the textures were just as enjoyable as the taste.  I highly recommend this hors d' oeuvre, but be aware that raw beef is not for people with compromised digestive systems, and it has a tendency to cause sleepiness for up to 24 hours if you are not accustomed to eating raw meat. 

For the next course it was the salmon, "Morue Noire" with a fennel salad and fried green tomatoes.  The seared salmon,  like the sunny side up egg was cooked just to the point where you could not accuse it of being raw.  The fats were nicely broken down, the meat was juicy and plump, it looked, smelled and tasted delicious.  Often salmon is overcooked, and I understand how difficult it is to get it right as I have ruined more than a few on the gas grill.  The timing and attention in this kitchen is dead on.  The salad and green tomatoes were OK, I am not a big fan of fennel or green tomatoes, so my opinion on these two should not carry much weight.

And for the last course, dessert which I almost always skip, I had the Soufflé a la Chocolate described on the menu as Tahitian vanilla crème anglaise.  It tastes just as good as it sounds.

Lastly, this is a place I consider semi casual, you don't have to put on a coat and tie, but you really shouldn't come in here looking like you spent the day doing yardwork.Sure miss you guys. Don't miss the Wynn so much. Thanks for taking care of me every morning off Maryland Parkway. Thanks again, Scotty in Dallas, that's Dallas Georgia. Don't want upset that Eagles fan. Almost forgot, they would gobble up your place out here. I live near a place called the Crossroads, there's a Starbucks and a Dunkin Doughnuts on two of the four corners. Neither are very good, but they are packed every day. Lines around the buildings.Consistently good food here. I've only had the Belgian waffle, chicken Apple sausage, grits or hash brown and everything is good. The mimosas are pretty good as well. Waits can be looong on the weekends, so be prepared for that.  There is a small bar upfront and you can order coffee or espresso while you wait.Wings are great. Love the bar employees and the crowd. It's a good mixed crowd where u r likely to hear everything from country to hip hop. Stop by for a great time.Great little and I do mean tiny restaurant. We had shoyu ramen bowls and it was delicious.  In and out in 30 min, but don't be surprised if you have to wait for a seat.  Place sits about 30. We will be back!After reading all of the positive reviews, I really expected more. I really wanted to love this place, but the food is average at best. I had a two meat plate (moist brisket and pulled pork) with beans and slaw. Considering that this is "central Texas style," I wanted the brisket to be the star of the show. The problem was that nothing on my plate was the star of anything. The brisket was nothing special. It tasted like fatty roast beef. I know that brisket is supposed to have that strong beef flavor, but it shouldn't remind you of deli meat, which is what I tasted.  In my opinion both Rudy's and Texas BBQ House have much better brisket than does Little Miss BBQ. 

The pulled pork was worse than the brisket. It was completely bland. There was no smoke flavor to it, and the pork flavor was virtually nonexistent. I'm not exactly sure how pork lacks pork flavor, but there was absolutely nothing memorable about this piece of meat.

The sides were okay. Slaw is slaw, and the beans were unusual but good. However, the selection of beverages was somewhat annoying: They didn't have any freshly brewed iced tea (sweet or unsweetened). Fresh iced tea goes hand-in-hand with BBQ. It's dang-near sacrilege to serve bottled iced tea at a BBQ place.

Maybe I should return and try some different things on the menu. The ribs looked pretty good. But, after my experience today, I'm reluctant to return. That's not to say the food here is complete crap. Little Miss BBQ is certainly better than somewhere like Famous Dave's, but it certainly doesn't live up to the hype or the praises of the Yelp community.There's a rush of high school students that show up at about 2 when the school across the street lets out. I would recommend not coming at this time or anytime after that. They are very loud and trash the place and sometimes the mess sits for hours after the kids have left. Generally speaking the staff does nothing about it. They have a little sign on the wall that says "seating for customers only" but don't enforce it. 

Outside of that annoying bit, I really like the place. Small and quiet with a great atmosphere. They offer great teas and coffee for a very reasonable price.Worst breakfast food! Incredibly bland and mediocre - in a city full of amazing brunch options, please do yourself a favour and avoid Cora's.Good food all around. Wild mushroom with arugula is my favorite. The salads are fresh and takeout is quick. Way better than fast food surrounding it.Chennai Delicacy has a retail store, but it is for large portion to-go only.  It is all freshly made the night before and is very authentic and that means very spicy.  If you give them a day's notice you can get the heat down.  As they do catering to businesses and parties, their hours are not standard and they don't have a menu u can order from.  They cater once\/week to my work and it is always delicious.  My family all are big fans of spicy, authentic Indian food and love Chennnai, but southern Indian food is very hot and the standard heat is too hot even for my spice lovers.  The owner is very pleasant and I wish they'd open a real retail location with a lunch buffet.Looking to get away?!  Want to get out of the heat and go to Hawaii?  If you want a little taste of the islands go to Wow Wow Hawaiian Lemonade!  You get that island Hawaiian feel right when you walk through the door.  The smells of fresh cut fruit, the laid back Hawaiian atmosphere, and the tropical decor transports you out of the heat and into the tropics.  Everyone who works there is super friendly and treats you like Ohana (Family).  The best thing you see from a staff perspective is that the Owners are very active with their customers.  They are taking orders, cutting fresh fruit, making the menu items, and talking to customers to make sure you have an amazing Hawaiian experience.

Right off the bat you get the crunch of the thick multi grain toast, then the smooth creaminess of the peanut butter, the flavor of the banana, then the coconut flakes cacao nibs, and the sweetness of the honey on the back end.  This toast has tons of flavor on every level and amazing texture.

BrandonFitFoodieTried AZ88 a couple months ago and was pretty impressed. Though the food seemed to be more like typical bar food, the drinks and cool restaurant environment make it a worth while dining experience. The martinis are huge and one should definitely be enough for the average customer. I got the BLT for my entree and the bacon was insanely Smokey which I really liked. Other than that it was a pretty standard sandwich. Dessert was my favorite part, we got the Strawberry Shortcake which was amazing. I will definitely be back again for drinks and dessert!This place is my go to for my to-go brisket order (24.99) and I only ate here 2 dining. The food is ok, I've tried other korean bbq way better than this place. The 2nd time we can here like 2 days ago with my daughter 5y\/o got charged $19.99 for my daughter for eating the SIDE DISH and rice from my bowl nothing else she had 1 side of bean sprout and server came to me and said because she's eating we have to charge her and I was like how much? Even she's not eating MEAT? she was like yes she's eating so she get charged for the letter C price. And I was like well she's not eating meat is their any other price? And she was no that's it. I understand kids has to pay but these restaurant is ridiculous. If my child is eating a lot sure gladly pay it. Or she could have ask me to pay the side dish ala carte cause she ate 2 side dish of bean sprout, they have her a 2nd bean sprout after charging us $19.99 so yeah that was great!Vastly improved in the last few months. The lobster bisque is awesome and the menu has made huge strides. Still a little pricey but good food and the service is better.I had no idea this was ran by the devil himself Mcdonalds... Made sense since I get sick every time I eat chipotle. I eat pretty clean and they claim they are GMO free.. My body knows when something isn't organic.. This place is such a disappointment! Along with McDonalds this place is on my shit list! I'm just sad that they claim something as bold as non GMO and it's not even true. We should be able to trust the food that we eat.Very unimpressed. I expected alot more based on all the hype.  All the fries that came to our table were cold and soggy. My chicken sandwich was cold as well, and the chicken was VERY bland!  Both the Sprite and the Ketchup were amazing though!  I hope they can get it together.  DTLV needs some decent places to eat. Good luck.  Service was acceptable.I really like the clean atmosphere,everything tasted good, spanikopita was a bit dry, Greek fries were just ok and the big fat pita was not bad, but just kinda basic, the Sevier here was great very polite people, very fast, i just can't get past the basicness of the food nothing stood out as fantasticAfter the so-so dining experience here last time, my boyfriend and I decided to give this restaurant another try. 
This time, we went for the late night menu (available after 10pm) for $24. 
We got the soup and sardine for appetizer and chicken and tartar for main courses. I also got the passion fruit  
mille feuille for dessert. 
The food was decent, but maybe because it was late at night? Everything felt very rough. The chicken was literally piled on a bunch of fries with very little presentation. Don't get me wrong, the tartar was fresh and the chicken was tasty. Maybe my expectation was too high for this restaurant. 
The service was worse than what I expected as well. We had to wait for the waiter to refill our water despite there were very little people in the restaurant. 

Short conclusion, food was good, service was just ok.This place is open 24 hours so perfect to go to when you want something to eat in the middle of the night if you stay at Elara or Planet Hollywood. They have almost everything on the menu from omelettes to burgers, pasta, chinese food, soups, salads, and steak. Their ahi tuna salad and cilantro chicken salad is pretty good. I also always get their lemongrass soup, hot and sour soup, or egg drop soup. Their food is decent and they always have deals going on like breakfast specials, all you can eat pancake specials, happy hours, etc. throughout various times on certain days. Their specials are actually really good deals because it is a lot cheaper. For example, they had a breakfast special when we went on a Friday morning. The breakfast special ended at 11am that day and the steak and eggs was only about $6.99. 

However, the service here is terrible! The waiters take  long time to acknowledge you have just been seated. When you have already placed your order, it takes forever for food to come to the table. I've been here when the restaurant was full and when the restaurant was empty. The wait for our food took just as long when it was empty. They also forget to bring you things when you ask for extra sauce, utensils, water refills ,etc. 

Overall, I come here because of convenience, the food is alright, and I'm usually not in such a hurry. I'ts just frustrating sometimes that they take forever and forget requests.Oh man the Pho is so well made, I have nothing but high praises for the Noodle Bar. The amount of detail to flavors is so evident. The food is always fresh and the portions are huge.What a delight for vegetarians and their carnivorous friends as well. The owner and chef is personable, charming and modest despite the brilliance of these recipes. Yes, many of the plates are a daring simulacrum of your favorite proteins. The joy of this place is that the food is just as good while being much more sustainable, healthy and ethical in practice. I myself am not a strict vegetarian but I respect those who are. Moreover, the chef himself is highly regarded and conscientious about his recipes. 

The delivery option here is good, but I would recommend you jist bring yourself in. These dishes succeed because of their hard earned texture which gets a bit lost for some items in the ride of over. If you do order take out then choose options like the orange chicken which will be just as good and avoid crispy items that would obviously become soggy. It is no different than if ordering fish and chips to go - don't ever do it.6 of us had reservations here one Saturday night back in May (table by the window). This was our first time visiting here and we were excited. While waiting for the table to be set up, a server walked by and dropped a wine glass shattering glass all over where we were standing. It scared me and I had to unbuckle my sandals to see if I had been cut anywhere or had glass stuck. The server that dropped it said a quick sorry but then our actual server was kind of snippy about it and was curt "well you aren't bleeding are you". I feel like I should have been offered a more sincere apology. It set the mood and tone of the dinner off as a downer. The food was good though. But I probably won't go back.First time in this place, I haven't seen a deli here in Vegas that quite looks like NY deli. I ordered toasted bialys and my friends got a bagel and it was good. I did not try the hash brown. I asked for over medium egg and it came over easy. The Canadian bacon was 3 pieces as thin as a dime. They have an array of desserts and the menu is quite extensive. It's good for a try. I may come back again and try other food. Being a local New Yorker, this place is average.Found ourselves at Bachi after a long weekend, hungry for food that wasn't fast food,  yet not lemme-just-stuff-myself-silly buffet style either. Overall: love the concepts and menu but with a couple hangups!

FOOD: downright delicious. Not gonna lie, I was pretty impressed. We ordered the truffle fries ($5.5) (medium cut, parm cheese, truffle gravy drizzle + sun-dried tomato aioli)...what in the holy hayellllll. This was so amazing! I could eat this literally as a side to every meal. The truffle wasn't overwhelming and I love the substitute of the aioli for like, Heintz ketchup or something. Very classy, Bachi. The Kiki burger ($11) was #1) cutely named and #2) cooked to perfection with the best flavor combo ever! I loved the bun, as it was somewhat sweet and pillowy. It had a mix of mushrooms, a bacon\/sweet onion glaze and gruyere cheese. 

SERVICE: Not that great. It took a long time to get our food (30+ minutes). We were only 4 girls and didn't order anything out of the ordinary or massive amounts of food. Heck, the restaurant wasn't even that busy .. not all the tables were full, so I'm still a bit stumped why it took so long.

DRINKS: The lychee boba milk tea was aiiiiight. Nothing special. They didn't put enough ice, so it was a bit warm and milky.. not really what I hoped for in 100+ degree weather. The lychee flavor was good though and not overwhelming.

OVERALL: Satisfied, good for a try, not sure if I would go out of my way for this again, but if you do, it'll be a good choice!We recently stayed here for my husband and my unofficial honey moon. We got our room for a very good deal from the My Vegas game. Unfortunately the room was subpar. It smelled of mold and was very cramped. We requested the handicap room and it didn't even have room for the wheel chair. Will not be back.Stopped in today for a quick lunch. The staff was very nice and welcoming. The food was as good as always!!!This was my first time and will be my last time eating here. I ordered the 4 rolled tacos combination and my bf ordered the #1 combination. Nothing had any flavor. Salt was definitely needed. I'd go to Roberto's any day over this place, and Roberto's usually forgets something in our order. The only reason I gave 2 star is because the drive thru employee was nice.This is one my favorite restaurants. Every time I come in I'm always welcomed and it gives off such a warm welcome. Food service is always quick. Many different tasty food options. Friendly cooks and the owner and other managers are always very polite.  I would refer this restaurant to any and everyone looking for good eating.My wife and I spotted this place by accident in search for another pizza joint near by but we decided to give it a try. This place offers more than rustic oven baked pizza. When you eat there the whole environment has history and charm. It seems every piece of furniture or decor has a story or has been re purposed in some creative way.
The pizza really good actually. It was very simple , full of flavor and that oven brick taste is really unbeatable.You know I went to places like this including Tokyo Express and Kyoto Bowl for a number of years... And I gave yogis a few chances over the years as well but it's really gone downhill. The beef is grizzly and fatty and of poor product and there is so much sodium I think I would need 80 mg of Lasix to get rid of all of it in my body... this is it I'm not calling back because I am seeing the consistent decreased quality. There are much healthier alternatives in venues now in the valley to patronize.Kinda Decent service today. Had lunch.  Delicious lasagna fritta  and fried ravioli and fried mushrooms. 
Only downside bread was cold and stale. 
But it kept me from eating too much so not necessarily a bad thing. 

Anna brought salad and breadsticks before we ordered. 
We only ordered appetizers for our entrees. 
At the end of the meal we paid on the table apparatus   
Her appearance at our table had been spotty at best but luckily another server was around. 
She asked if we had paid. We said yes. 
She said in a huff..."In the future know there will be an extra charge for the salad since we didn't order what they label as entrees". And walked off never to be seen. 
We didn't order a salad OR Breadsticks  for that matter. She brought them. 
To get that upset over lettuce and to assume we were deceitful was ridiculous. Wish I could get back my generous tip. 
Not sure if we will be back to OG and def not to this location.What is there to say? Super great food, staff, and atmosphere.

I left my brand new headset on the table and went back three hours later and the hostess found it for me. I was very thankful. This is the type of class and upscale place this is. 

Service was amazing. Everyone's dish came out hot and at the same time with each of us having our own staff plating\/serving the table.

The cuts are obviously some of the best in Las Vegas with each side dish prepared to perfections. I was upset that we did not order desserts (I'm cutting my sugar intake). I was so impressed with the Cut that I went online to see reviews and their website. That's when I discovered that I missed out BIG TIME on the desserts. They all looked amazing and the reviews were raving about them. 

If you are celebrating or simply looking for one of the best dining experiences in Vegas, go to the Cut.Couldnt order. Called the restaurant, who gave me a number for their delivery company. When I called them, they told me I couldnt order through them, I had to go to a website. 

Maybe I'll try it in person if Im in the area.My review is based on the food only, and from an american's perspective. I eaten some of the best mouthwatering wings from southern georgia to new york city to overseas. For the most part the wings at nextdoor pub & grill just suck. I was expecting wingporium (toronto) level wings at least and got dominoe's level chicken. The BBQ was nasty. I literally wiped off the sauce with a napkin. The honey garlic sauce was decent. It should be noted that these wings dont have their own flavor. Even though wings are tossed in sauce, the wings themselves should have it's own flavor. Once the sauce wears off, you realize you are eating unseasoned chicken. If I'm ever in Montreal again, I will definitely not come here.We ending our night walking back to the hotel and stopped to check this place out. Who don't love a pizza by the slice.. My husband loves him some good pizza. 
 slices New York style sizes. They offer dine-in and carry-out. Slice heated up at order. $$ reasonable price. Basic cheese or pepperoni below $5, slice of the day for $6. You plan on staying downtown add this place to your eat to-do list.Hopeful...bite, chew, swallow....Meh. 
Bite again, chew again,.... Meh. Darn! 

Had such high expectations (since I am from New York \/ Long Island) and have known the joy of real Bagel shops. 
Really, Bagel Cafe- your photos are beautiful...your presentation enticing....

You had me at Hamentashen! 
But you left me at the booth by the window with a mouth full of Meh.

SERVICE:
Counter help (women) are not very cordial and seem disinterested in helping or answering questions.
Stood there for a while as they just ignored me making their own coffee and being snobby. This is a service business; shouldn't you make people feel comfortable when they come through the door? And it wasn't just the way we were treated. Watched as other patrons got similar cold attitude. IMHO

Deli counter staff (men) are nice, helpful  and engaged. 

One waitress - over worked...but cordial. 

FOOD \/ BAGELS : GENERALLY GREAT
Coffee is good.
Bagels are great.
Lots of Cream cheese options and things to put with Bagels abound.
There is an emphasis on real traditional Jewish food which I really appreciate finding in LV! But although the Bagel Cafe has a niche market and offers loads of variety.....

FOOD\/ OTHER:
Ordered a feta spinach omelet. It came with a glob of feta in one spot. Feta was sour, melted, not Greek- style. Too much grease or butter used in cooking. 

Muffins are large, lovely, but oddly lacking in flavor.

Took some other pastries home and found them OK, none are "wonderful"- taste is rather bland - not exciting in the mouth.
Eating a bite of cranberry muffin as I write...chew, swallow, try it once more, Nope, still Meh! 

Overall, not sure we'd eat here again. 

Might get bagels and cream cheese to go. 
If I HAD to.

Wish it was better experience. Has promise, but it just seemed like they are missing something .... like interpersonal  warmth and flavorful food. 

Give it a try, anyway. You might find it better than I did-?...hopefully.Possibly my favorite restaurant in Vegas. It used to be a lot busier but I guess with the izakaya boom it's slowed down a bit. You definitely have to know what's good here because there are a lot of choices and some are just alright. 

From the regular menu you MUST get the miso black cod. It's the butteriest, silkiest, most delicious fish you'll ever eat. Other great picks to share for a group are the kushi katsu, yakitori, and shumai. Their ramen is also really good but a little heavy for tapas and not easy to share. 

The key here is to order the stuff off the walls. Of these the best are:

-Mochi wrapped bacon. Each skewer has 2-3 pieces of mochi. Sticky and greasy and awesome. 
- Jalapeno fried rice. This is my top choice next to the miso cod. Mix in the spicy paste!
-Tom Yum Roll. I've never had anything like this. It's seasoned like a Thai tom yum soup but in a sushi roll. It's wrapped in the rice noodles used for fresh rolls and has that same fresh cilantro taste with huge pieces of shrimp. They have half order available. 

Other good filler dishes from the walls:

-Wasabi green bean tempura. Some of these can be very spicy watch out!
-Croquettes. They have specials for croquettes so ask about them. We had a gratin croquette filled with macaroni and covered in gravy. Otherwise they have regular potato ones. 
-Okonomiyaki (seafood pancake) Just because you can't get that very many places. 

And last but not least yes. You should have the honey toast because Ichiza did it first (I think?) and still does it the best. If you've never had it you seriously must. They have smaller orders of it available but I can't vouch for it and I'd just go for the big deal. 

I love Ichiza for the variety and the overall feel of the place. It's always a good experience and definitely a unique place to bring friends and family and introduce them to a lot of different Japanese foods. 

PS. They have shochu which I can't find anywhere in Vegas liquor stores and they serve it on the rocks !Solid guacamole, crispy housemade chips and delicious tacos. One of the highlights during my recent trip to phoenix. Fair prices for solid food and the service was excellent. Surly and salty at times but I love good banter!Went to Switch as part of the lightrail pub crawl.

Not impressed.

I may go back to experience it as a restaurant, but as a bar it's nothing I'd revisit.I was early at a doctors appointment and went in for something to eat. The woman was vibrant and funny. I sat with my back near the warm window while I ate. I normally am not fond of normal bacon and eggs breakfast but this was out of this world. I then go to pay and realize I don't have my bank card on me and they don't take credit cards. Well, it sort of turned into a joke and I left to pick up some money at home. It made my day.this place is a real hidden gem! Mon Ami Gabi is probably one of the older restaurants on the strip but it is really good.  I came here for my friend's bday dinner. 

Its a really big restaurant and is great for big groups! 

I got their french onion soup and it was delicious but a little too cheesey and salty for me.

they have THE best tasting bread i have ever had. They continuously serve you fresh baguettes. I finished almost one whole baguette on my own. its THAT good.

They have a great variety of steaks. ALL of them i would recommend. The filet mignon was sooo delicious and their skirt steaks were great too. You really cant go wrong with any of their steaks. It comes with a HUGE side of shoe string fries!!! 

overall i really recommend this restaurant. Its affordable and tasty! 

recap:
1) good for groups
2) BREAD
3) STEAKS!!!!Great dumplings! These and Qing Hua are some of the best in Montreal.
Order in advance if you go there in a group.Everything was delicious and super fast service. Food was fresh and taste was just as good. I would recommend to anyone in the area. I brought family here to try Pho for the first time and they loved it!!!  Place was pretty busy so I'm guessing everyone loves it here.Well since I have never been to this hole the wall they "generously" gave me a chili sample that looked like umm someone real sick lol and tasted about the same and spicy I don't like.  Finally she got my order taken, hotdog with fixings and a drink. She talked me out of orange juice wtf.  Then the order comes up and their are fries there and a soda and hot dog. I didn't order fries I know that %100 for sure because I am on a strict and do not eat them but I still paid for and threw them away. One star for the loaded no chili hotdog.  That was alright.  Never going back!!This is my last time here. Stopped in again tonight; bathroom floor was filthy and looked like it hadn't been mopped all day and the paper towel dispenser was empty.

And AGAIN the soda machine was infested with drain flies and the dedicated ice machine hasn't worked in months. The drink station had dried up soda spilled all over it, hence the plump well-fed flies.

Though there was no trash on the tables, obviously they hadn't been wiped clean for a while. Most looked like they had greasy finger prints all over them.

And here's another pet peeve of mine with this place; when you get a salad the dressing packs are always greasy with food on them. I expect them to be clean. Where have they been?

I plan to call the health department in the morning about the drain fly issue. It's just plain nasty ...There is just no arguing that the Monterey Bay Fish Grotto has amazing views. Simply spectacular.  Inside, it has a nice decor and comfortable atmosphere.  That is where things began to break down.  The wine service was disappointing for a Wine Spectator Award of Excellence restaurant.  I ordered a specific vintage of Pinot Noir and reiterated the year to the waitress. The wine steward brought the wrong vintage, very poor for such a highly rated restaurant.  She was able to find the right bottle after I pointed out the error to her, but I shouldn't have had to point it out.  I also ordered the fish special, which came at a premium price, but it arrived lukewarm.  Again, disappointing. The food and wine "experience" downgraded the overall evening and showed that you can't live on ambiance alone in the restaurant business.  It will make me think twice before dining at the Monterey Bay Fish Grotto again.I like hang out sushi AYCE or other Buffets for lunch alone on every Saturday. Sushi AYCE has own special menus (this is 100% my opinion, favorite and other food is normal and lower); Osaka Golden Shrimp at Kenkou sushi, pretty decorated rolls at Sake sushi, well tempura and Thai wok at Aji Sushi and etc. I tried chicken wing skewers. Wow. it is excellent! If you are a wing lover, you must try it. Worst things, it isn't a AYCE. Whatever amount you ordered, all orders are same  such as three or four order for grilled beef ribs were same as two orders. They missed some orders  too. I really wanted and could not taste enoki rolls, the reason to try this restaurant. Parking............... so horrible. I went there 11:10am on Saturday. Try again this restaurant. 90% NO. 10% YES if I miss chicken a wing skewer. one more, they changed price.This is literally my favourite Chinese food spot...I will drive out of Mississauga and go downtown just to eat here. Very fast service though it can get really busy on Saturday nights when people hit this spot after the club to eat. Their General Tso chicken is amazing, and I personally am I big fan of their pan fried noodles with bean sprouts. I will sometimes go to Tremendous in Mississauga if I'm not feeling the drive to Toronto but honestly, they can't compare.Small little Japanese restaurant in the Don Mills neighbourhood. Lots of different rolls to pick from. 

Great lunch special selection.

Service is a little slow though. So if you only have 1 hour for lunch, may not be the best place. Take out is pretty quick though.Amazing wood fired oven pizza. They have a small dining room but it just adds to the ambiance of the place. My fiancé and I shared a salad and a pizza and we loved it so much that we ordered one to go so we could eat it later- it was just as good for dinner!10\/10 tasty bites! I had the Wontons, which tasted like chinese crab rangoon. The spring rolls were tasty and the peanut sauce was light but flavorful. The coconut curry was packed full of flavor and veggies that paired nicely with the rice noodles. The wonton soup was okay, the sweet and sour chickn was fun too! I love loving hut!Trying out the new Italian place close to home. Decided to go with the antipasto and a pizza. The antipasto was delish!!! Definitely get it. The pizza was good... the dough was more bready than chewy. I prefer chewy - like back home in NY. 
Next visit will be to try out some entrees.Great spot for dinner....wonderful service and food.  Mario is a fantastic host and the other guests eating dinner at the bar made for a fantastic experience.  It was my first visit to Salumi Vino and I will be sure to return when I come back to Montreal.  Great food, wine, service and company - you will NOT be disappointed!First time here.  Stopped in on a whim with my daughter and mother.  Love the atmosphere.  Excellent food.  Lunch portions were more than enough.  Prices are very reasonable.  Service was fantastic.My wife and I try to come here at least twice a month. Liz and the others make every dining experience wonderful. Our favorites are the oyster rockefeller, crab mango stack, mushroom quesadilla, and the incredible grilled shrimp tamale. The tamale will change your life if you let it. But seriously, everything is great. (I'd like to mention a couple other key\/delicious players: mac & cheese, tacos al pastor, tequitos, guacamole etc) if I keep going I would have to list the menu!First time here. Pretty nice lounge to chill with friends and smoke shisha. Flavorful shisha  but they use cheap disposable hoses (not cool!). Relaxing ambience with dimmed lights (can be a little depressing for some). Super friendly service. Great music. Free WiFi. Downside is that there isn't much to eat here, and washrooms are mediocre. $1 charge for credit card use.My dad has been talking about how good the food is here. So in this visit we made a stop for lunch. The burger was excellent and the fries were so fresh!  Service was fantastic and it is no wonder this is a neighborhood favorite.Come here and get pizza  it's by the slice or whole. Great place for a lunch date, or while you're waiting for a massage at the massage school next doorI got their groupon (along with half the city), so it was my first time trying the place. I wasn't sure what to expect but the reviews and the online menu looked good.
Their weakest point is their location; they're on the bottom of an office building behind a BP gas station, so it's not so easy to find. Google maps aren't marking them right on the map either. 
the parking situation isn't the best either. It's mostly 1-hour visitors parking signs that only after we got in and asked we were told those are only restricted during offices business hours (so don't worry about parking there in the evening).
The inside and the food were good. The place was packed but still the service was pretty good considering that all the tables were taken and there was a line at the bar.
Their garlic naan and the dips that come with it is amazing!
The rest of the food was decent; I wouldn't say the best Indian food I ever had but not the worst either (I think I'm using another reviewer's words here, but he was spot on).
Overall, a good experience. And it's not like there's many other Indian cuisine choices in the area.This place have good food, but service is BAD. The supervisor "Belen" have time to look at her cellphone but no time to help the cashier. Line is always long. Every time I come here I get disappointed. Need to retrained supervisors. I don't like the other ladies that helps assemble the food you're so polite and nice hopefully Belen Learns from themit's a nice establishment to visit, especially if your on a date, this is perfect. The prices are reasonable. I got the Chestnut waffle ice-cream just because I've never seen it, it was okay as far as chestnut ice-cream goes. But next time I'd probably try something different, I think the place is more for people to take pictures of the food to post on social media. They even give you quote props to add when your taking a picture. It's definitely a novelty Cafe. I'd recommend anyone to go at least once.considering the reviews that this place gets, I'm disappoi yed by the quality and service of this place. everything is too expensive in my opinion. I've given this place 3 tries and pretry sure i don't like it. I tried their bombolino (both nutella and custard filled pastries), almond croissant, and their fruit cake - they didn't taste special or superb; rather the taste was meh.  Each time i went there I felt pressured to buy something the staff was eyeing me as i walked up and down the store looking at the baked good and their pizza + pasta stationsExcellent and fresh sushi. I have eaten here many times and it never fails to impress. Recommend!I've been here so many times and I can't believe I've never rated it.
This is probably one of my favourite AYCE Sushi joints in town but beware the wait... during lunch the lineup are long!

Once you are in the service is pretty quick. I highly recommend the Firehouse Roll and the Black dragon roll which as amazing here. Sashimi is only available for dinner but it's fresh and worth paying extra for at night.Not my first time here. There is very little at this end of the airport as far as eating goes.

As far as this place, the staff is awesomely friendly and efficient for them I give 5 stars.

I saw the sign outside today that said try the Chis and fips the batter was good and the fish a touch dry but all in all a good deal for the location and the price.

That being said, I guess I  spoiled from eating fish and chips at Kahunas in white rock.I usually love Applebees and enjoy the food. Our lunchtime experience at the Steelyard location was very disappointing.  Service was horrible even though the place was empty.  After drinks arrived, long wait to order food.  Food came , another long wait but without utensils.  Could not locate server to get a fork, finally asked busboy.  Another wait!
When the check arrived we were asked to donate money to their charity.  When we said no, the server rolled her eyes at us.  Saw that! 
Another wait for change!   I understand waiting if place was busy but I could easily count the number of patrons in the room.   Sent a review to corporate office and was promised a reply in 3-5 business days.  No response after 2 weeks.  Very disappointed!Absolutely amazing capes, super cute place, love it! Definitely coming again and again!It was the first time I tried this place. It was good. I really liked how the Eel was cooked for the sushi. Not over cooked thankfully. I was a bit disappointed with the white tuna nigiri , Albaquerque- it was partially cooked which took it away from the real sushi taste. Otherwise the tuna, salmon (I forgot what the sushi was called) but the combination was great.I want to give them a quick shout-out because we really do enjoy this little place. Our server yesterday was laid back but a pro and he gave us a mini-Japanese lesson and couple of laughs. It is notable - the difference that good service can make. 

Their Happy Hour (HH) is probably one of the best we've tried - given the price point and the variety of selection. Not only that - the regular menu prices are below what you'd pay many other places and the food is just as good if not even better due to the creativity of the chefs. 

We really enjoyed the Ono nigiri - it's so fresh, buttery and delicious. The rolls we had this time were the classic rainbow ($8) currently on HH and the Climax. ($12 never HH) and both are worth an "order again."

They have the laminated, spiral-bound type of menu here (with photos and descriptions) which makes ordering that much more enjoyable. They have the usual other offerings of udons, full range of appetizers, etc. 

Their strip mall location is the reason that this place falls off my radar, but I'm making the effort to write 'em up because I want to remember to visit more often. I don't want to be saying "Ono! I forgot."Not life changing but good cheesecake. I liked the fluffy cheesey souffle esque concept but the line was ultimately not worth it.
Probably won't come back.I'm a regular customer here, because the food is quite good. But maybe not anymore.

But the tableware needs major improvements, both on the dishware themselves and the maintenance of them.

1) A lot of the dishes and cups are rusted. Literally, rust particles float around the water cup. And the dishes are so rusted away that I was afraid to put any food in it.

2) Most of their tableware are enamel-based. The cups\/dishes were rusted probably because the enamel layer was taken off\/broken\/ melted away or whatever during the heavy commercial use. That's fine if they swiftly replace them with new ones. But they aren't doing so. 
It's well known that damaged enamel-based dishes release heavy metal elements, such as lead, based on what they're  made of (it's usually some kind of metal). They are potentially carcinogenic, and also cause Alzheimer's and dementia. 

And at this stage , it's obvious that  their cups and dishes are so heavily damaged to the point of being rusty. You don't want to ruin your good food with such terrible dishware.

3) The cups and dishes were filthy. I was horrified to see such a lot of dried food particles stuck on the dishes.

And what made me write this review? I mentioned all these to the cashier and what I heard was: 
"So what? That's the way it is". With a shrug.

Well ok, you just lost a regular customer.This place has really gone downhill in the past year. Very disappointing. The bathrooms are dirty, the booth seats are cracked and the food that you order comes out without the ingredients that are listed on the menu. It really seems like they are struggling.Epic. Just go here. Spend a few extra bucks and get the bigger crabs. The small ones are a lot of work for almost no meat. Really messy. Your hands smell like the ocean for days, hehe. Get the boardwalk fries for sure.Petit bar sympa avec de bonnes bières et des accras de morue tendres et goûtus pour accompagner tout ça!
Ambiance toujours sympa et terrasse extérieure pour les soirs où st Denis est fermée :)This has to be the worst restaurant in Las Vegas! To start with, I think it's the only  italian restaurant I've ever been to  that charges you for mediocre bread. The portions are a joke and incredibly overpriced considering how small and uninteresting they are. I ordered the chicken which was the smallest chicken I've ever seen. It tasted average at best, and I was still hungry after dinner. The waiter was reluctant to give us breadsticks (made it sound like he did us a favor swiping them off the bar) and we paid $5 for "stromboli" bread which was average at best. 
Everyone who works there seems unhappy and look like they don't want to be there, and the overall experience was awful. If I could rate it a zero I would. The entire experience was unpleasant, food unsatisfying, terrible menu, broken pizza over and apathetic service. I would never return and suggest you don't go either.By far the best Mediterranean food near the University. Their service is a little slow. They have belly dance over the weekend which is really good. The food is tasteful, mixed of spices is well crafted. The pita was fresh and hot.Now this is fish & chips so much flavor.  I won't be able to order anywhere else but here at Gordon Ramsay.  The dirty fries you have to order has so much flavor even though it sound spicy it's really not.  The dressing was bomb. It was worth ever dollar.  Definitely we'll come back when I'm in Vegas again.they usually get the order right. I don't like how they don't offer or include a spork when you order nachos supreme or nachos bell grande. All other Taco Bells that I've been to, it's policy, they just give it. This one, not.Good lord this place is like Christmas in your mouth... authentic and flavor is on point. Go, you will certainly be hooked I am sure!Came for a friends birthday and had a great time. Nicole was a fantastic server and even got the whole restaurant to sing happy birthday to the birthday girl. Food was great and will definetly be back.The atmosphere is nice and classy here, especially for an American bar and grill. The staff are incredibly nice and helpful as well. However, I have this place only three stars because of the quality of their food. Fries were a bit too soggy and under seasoned for my liking. The hoagie that I ordered was just okay - a little bland. 

I probably would recommend a friend here only for the experience of the atmosphere - not for the food!Casino Floor review only.

We went to see KA here and then puttered around for a few hours after, so I have nothing to report on the rooms. But a few things did strike me enough to write up a 4-star for the ol' MGM Grand. 

This place is HUGE. Like, get lost as hell huge. Rows and rows and rows of slot machines, a crapton of table games and just people milling around EVERYWHERE. The vibe here was really energetic and fun, and it was just a Tuesday night, so nothing special was going on  (I don't think.)

BUMMED I missed the Lion Habitat. We meant to go back the next day but ended up heading to Old Vegas and then we never made it back. That's totally on my list of to-dos for next time. 

Two Words: Blackjack Switch. New favorite game EVER (see my review of Casino Royale for the full-on love affair)! They also had $5 minimum video blackjack, (real blackjack with a virtual dealer, not the video poker kind) which was kind of strange, but for $5 a pop, a good way to kill some time if you're tired of slots. 

It seemed like the entertainment here we pretty great. We saw KA (separate review) and then they have the Lion Habitat, David Copperfield (although I think that's a limited engagement), and a ton of yummy-looking restaurants. I think there were some other exhibits as well.

Great way to kill a couple hours without spending a ton of money on huge table limits.One of my favorite places for breakfast. Servers hostess bussers are always very nice and attentive. 
Food is perfect. Nothing fancy, just a great breakfast. Coffee mug is large enough and never gets cold.This is easily one of my FAVORITE restaurants. Whether or not you're a pho fan, you should have your first experience of pho at this location. You'll instantly be hooked by their incredibly speedy service & delicious food. I've been here about 20 times now and continue to bring new friends each time. These new friends become obsessed with UnPhogettable and we often cannot compare the food nor service with any other pho location. On that note, despite your location, I still will always recommend UnPhogettable on Dobson Rd when you're in need of some reasonably priced large portions and a comfortable environment. It's worth the drive !Gave this place a 4 before, now its a 2.  Tried dining in and it was pretty aweful.  They don't put bbq sauces on their tables and that is a definite minimum and requirement for a bbq restaurant.  They also refuse to give you water.  They make you buy bottled water which is just tacky I think.  Providing glasses of water is also a definite minimum and requirement.  Food was also pretty mediocre this time.  They just don't meet the minimums anymore.Hello. My review only needs a few words; HAIR BAKED IN ! We bought our first and last pie yesterday and to our disgust there was a foot long hair baked into the dough. All I expect when paying 13 dollars for a 12inch pie is it  tastes good, cooked well, and free of foreign matter. Word of advice, hair nets and gloves.As a chef I often need a few sprigs of thyme, mint or maybe just one eggplant. This is a great place it is small in size but has enough of the things I need to go when I am in a pinch. They have a huge bakery and restaurant, not a big fan of chinese bakery and the food is so-so. I'm happy I can always get NC farm raised fish, the occasional thyme and a small selection of Indian spices and all the coconut milk I can ever useMy brother-in-law heard of this place on Diners, Drive ins and Dives. He called while I was in Vegas and said to try it! Well the brisket was soooooo good as were the yams. Others had pulled pork and they raved about it. The servers were really friendly. 
Getting there was an adventure and it is located in a residential area. Don't miss out on this place!!!!The food is always great and the service is astounding. We're treated like regulars whenever we come in, whether they remember us or not. I cannot stress how amazing the staff is, from the waiters to the bartenders, even the cooks. Best chill place to eat\/drink in Fitchburg. Get the nachos!!!Update: so, when I posted the review, the owner messaged me and apologized that I had a bad time at his restaurant, which I think is really cool. I promised to try their breakfast, which is their specialty. I tried it the other day and it's very good! I had the country fried steak, and a friend had their eggs Benedict. Both were really good. As usual, the service was great. The country fried steak was huge and sitting on the biggest biscuit I have ever seen (interestingly, it was better than the biscuits at Biscuits cafe). Seriously, that fucker was the size of a VHS tape. The eggs are served however you want, and note to the cook, scrambled with cheese does not mean make scrambled eggs and put cold cheese on top when plating, but they were down a cook and busy, so I don't blame them, I doubt it was on purpose. All in all, as a relatively picky customer, I'd say they're pretty good. If red robin is a 2, this place is a 4 at a similar price.Such a nice group of people at EBB. I came in for my typical bagel and coffee and I experienced the best service. It was a little busy, but I got my food in a timely manner, and I left very satisfied. So excited to come back!This is the real deal!  the fish was fresh fresh fresh!  The sushi chef knows what he is doing!  They have very authentic dishes!  Yes, it is a bit expensive, but the fish is delicious!  Looking forward to a return trip!This is a full proof, tasty, go-to place for me.  I enjoy a lager anyday of the week and twice on happy hour days! I think that enjoying some great food and drink during happy hour is the absolute way to go at the Yardhouse, for it can be a bit pricy during regular hours.  I am a sucker for the shirmp and vodka pasta. Think there is a bit of crack in it becaus I can't stop eating it even when a button pops off the jeans. But you can get just about any dish here and adore it. I love my beer and I dig the Sunset Wheat on tap! I like to grab a few drinks after dinner on Sunday nights *happy hour* begins at 10pm!Bleh!

The food here is so bland. I ordered the Chicken Marsala and it was the worst I have had. The noodles seemed over cooked and mushy and the chicken looked really greasy. It tasted like it could have been made out of a box\/power mix. Just not good. Also, the proportions are tiny!

The restaurant itself is small, but they seemed to have most of their tables set up for groups of about 6-7 people.

Eh, defiantly won't be coming back.Ordered yum won sen, chicken tom kar and chili fried rice. The shrimp in the glass noodles was undercooked (raw) and the spice and fish flavor was too high. Maybe this is the dish, but it did not appeal to me at all. The soup was also sour in a off way and not balanced well with the coconut milk. I enjoyed the fried rice. Pretty pricy $45 for food I couldn't finish. Sorry, I won't be back. Sever was very pleasant and the food came fast.Amazing experience, Jim was the best waiter I have ever had the pleasure of having. Great service, recommend waiter Jim!Essence is the hotel restaurant that serves up a great breakfast. Depending on your hotel frequency, you may be able to get breakfast as part of your stay as otherwise it's fairly expensive for what you're getting. For breakfast, there's eggs, bacon, an omelette station, a machine that automatically squeezes oranges into juice, and a variety of cool goods. 

The server is especially nice and will be very attentive with making sure your coffee cups are full. Great place to eat if youre staying at the Westin.Gawd.....Came in with high expectations, but was disappointed. 

I gotta give it to Shibuya for the atmosphere though. It's quite amazing.

The food, is decent, but not worth the price.

I had the Tempura Udon which was $16, but ended up tasting like instant Udon.The food here is great! A real diamond in the rough. I would recommend any curry - they're all amazing. The spice levels can be adjusted based on ones preference. The only downside is the service can be a bit slow, especially for the initial drink order - they should arrive much faster. However that is easily overlooked by the delicious food for a very fair price. It tends to get crowded in the evenings, especially weekends, though typically not too crowded to not be able to accommodate anyone. And - free wifi!My favorite Baton Rouge of all the other franchises! 

Doesn't give you that franchise-y feeling but more like you're at home?! 

Staff is great and friendly! 
Menu is superb and food is awesome try the chicken! Delicious baked potato. Drinks aren't diluted just great! 

Worth the drive to Maple!Great for health conscious fanatics... They serve it three ways: vegan,vegetarian or regular. The healthier you order the more expensive. I ordered the tuna salad sammich and chose the salad in lieu of baked chips, with a mojito tea. It was surprisingly satisfying!My wife and I recently moved to the area and decided to try this place out.  I ordered the beef and broccoli which was really good. My wife had the sweet and sour chicken which she really liked.  We went back a few weeks later.  I had ordered the same and my wife ordered the szechuan chicken.  I thought the beef was a little tougher this time trough but my wife like the szechuan chicken.  I would still go back.We just had a wonderful dinner tonight with a fun table and awesome chef ( Daniel). Everything cooked perfectly! Jasmine our server was on top of everything and very friendly. She made everyone at ease and felt very welcoming. My husband and I did the restaurant week menu and came home with doggie bags a great deal! We had the land sea meal. Filet and scallops, yum! You'll enjoy your meal.I've been looking for a great breakfast place in Laveen since I moved out here. This is the place! It looks shady when you drive up but fear not - great food and service.Where to begin. How many times have I driven by Randy's over the years? Maybe 100 or probably even more? Every time I drive by, I look in and see crowds enjoying themselves; especially around 4:30 for the early bird special. But can you blame a place located in the heart of old town for having some retirees on their list of regulars? I can't. In fact, I applaud Randy's. Apparently the old timers know what's up. 

Let me be truthful here. Randy's is just a diner. It's your everyday, run of the mill, All American neighborhood diner...and it's awesome. Walking in on a Saturday morning at 9:30, the place was jam packed with folks of all ages. The staff quickly greeted us and scurried us to an open table while keeping a smile on their face. Looking around, guests looked like they were having a good time. Whether it was the group of partiers who needed some grease to settle their hangover or the retirees on the run from Sun City andd taking a morning walk to get breakfast and coffee, I saw just about every type of person at Randy's. 

Now let me get to the menu. I am pretty sure that not a thing on the breakfast menu exceeds $6.00. Slowly but surely, Scottsdale's losing this trait of economically priced meals so I salute Randy's for keeping the prices down. Now on to star number two in my book of Randy's cuisine. Do you ever go to a restaurant for breakfast and think...I'd really like an egg but I'm also craving a pancake or french toast, but I don't want nor do I need a full order of carbs. I do all the time. I love pancakes and I love french toast, but there's a rare occasion when I actually order that as my main entree for a meal. Enter Randy's. In their 20+ breakfast combination choices, they offer options like "one egg, one piece of bacon, and a half order of french toast" or the same but with a pancake instead. When I read this, my heart skipped a beat for Randy wherever he is. And let me also mention that this meal is around $4.50. Can't beat that! 

The food itself was just what the doctor ordered. It tasted homemade, with flavor and it was just the right amount of food. Now don't walk in expecting The Food Network to feature Randy's, but if you want a solid breakfast at a decent price, this is your spot. But buyer beware. They only accept cash or checks. Better bring some cash because if you are under the age of 60, I highly doubt you're walking around with a check book and if you lack both, you'll be slapped with a $3 ATM fee. That's nearly the price of the meal! 

So until next time Randy's. With a six (?) page menu chock full of everything imaginable in small town USA dining, I think I have my hands full getting through it!I ran across this place they Facebook and my husband and i decided to give it a shot. We dined in and we had their pozole which was bomb for just $6 bucks also their flautas were bomb. After our meal we went to the bar where Ashley was just amazing she educated us in a lot of tequila. Then the owners Stevee and Andres introduce themselves and they were super friendly and fun, hands down everything about this establishment is amazing.. definitely will be coming backGo straight to Taqueria Arturo to get it all - amazing authentic, creative fresh and so satisfying!
Recently visited Oohlala Mobile.com's Montreal HQ for a week to build strategies. Discovered foid gold around the corner. Yep!  you want the get there.

Arturo's and sister shop Diablo's (on Saint Laurent arond the corner) get in right every time. Taco and tquilla bliss at one, smokey award winning ribs plus smoked and fried chicken to comfort you in flavors.

Opened just a few weeks Arturo's will quickly be any seeker of true food and vibe's go to lunch, dinner or late night.

Try it all, high end tequilla and mezcal abound, combined with the friendliest, most attentive staff this traveler found all week. Brunch on Saturday 10-3 blew me away. Get in early and often - you'll have a new go to and your belly will love you more.Some of the most amazing staff around! The general manager has literally some of the best customer service than any other place!!!! -Super Pawn TeamMaybe I am just a sucker for romantic atmospheres -- I love The Melting Pot with a capital "L" 
Start with dessert first. Not literally, I mean, it's up to you. This is my favorite part and I am drooling just thinking about it right now. The chocolate fondue in several variations, paired with fresh fruit, cake, and more (it's to DIE for). Well, maybe not DIE, I tend to exaggerate when it comes to things I love. But I'm a big chocolate enthusiast, so of course, this is something I look forward to every time I visit The Melting Pot. The servers are very casual and usually quite knowledgeable, and don't really force you into settling for a payment plan if all you want is an appetizer. I only say payment plan because a meal for two is actually quite expensive, especially if you go all out and get wine, drinks, etc. The appetizer fondue is amazing as well. With the cheese or chocolate fondue, you pick any combination you like of what they have to offer, the choices are basically unlimited. The appetizers come with vegetables and an array of fresh bread bits. The ambiance is really nice, generally quiet, romantic, lights dimmed way down low. I have good memories of this place, and it's in a nice location of Pittsburgh in Station Square looking over the river. The sad thing is, you really wouldn't want to take your date out to any of the clubs next door afterwards, unless you wanted her to get groped in a corner on her way out of the bathroom or trashed talked to by some fugly wigger or wiggette. Sad but true. 
The parking is in a garage close to the mall where The Melting Pot is located, and is relatively inexpensive, which honestly, will be the least of your concerns when dining here.Other than the homemade food my Polish grandparents made, this is the best Polish food you will ever eat (but of course I'm biased towards my grandparents recipes). The kielbasa, stuffed cabbage, pierogi, and sauerkraut are just perfect here. Great selection of beers just tops it off, including Great Lakes and Polish beer. I need to get back here ASAP.I've been wanting to try Sumo ever since we drove by it. We decided to give it a try Tuesday night. Upon entering the restaurant you are greeted by the sight of two giant sumo wrestler statues. The space is large with plenty of parking. We opted for the regular dinner versus the hibachi grill. Our hostess seated us and gave us menus.

We were pleasantly surprised to find out that Tuesday nights they have a special sushi and martini menu. The rolls, nigiri, and martinis were very reasonably priced. Our waitress came by with water and to take our drink order. The menu is pretty extensive so I needed more time before ordering when she returned. 

When she eventually came back we ordered the Ladies Fingers (steamed okra), Grilled Squid, Mackerel and Scallop Nigiri, Sumo, Shrimp Tempura and Eel Rolls. The Ladies Fingers was a platter w\/two rows of okra covered w\/a tasty soy sauce. I really liked this dish -- pretty, the sauce was delicious, and I would order it again. The grilled squid was kind of hit and miss. It was a good sized squid, I would say about 9 inches, beautiful to look at, with a mildly spicy mayo. The tentacles and the end of the squid were very rubbery, hard to chew and impossible to cut with your fork. The middle was cooked perfectly - tender and flavorful. I preferred dipping the squid in the soy sauce on the okra versus the mayo which actually came with the squid. I kept my water-glass near the end of the table hoping it would be refilled and occasionally it was.

The sushi was pretty decent. The mackerel slices were on the small size but the scallops were larger. Both were fine. The Sumo and Shrimp Tempura rolls both had eight pieces. Their flavor was excellent. The eel roll was six pieces and I enjoyed it but not as much.

I really like that Sumo had some dishes I have not seen elsewhere such as the okra and the grilled squid. I also really liked the Tuesday night prices. The service while friendly was definitely a little lackluster. I would go back to try the Hibachi on a special occasion and I can imagine going back on a Tuesday for the specials but it won't become a regular for us.I was pleasantly surprised with this place.I though 7.50 was a little high just for a burger,but it was huge and I could barley finish it.It was actually really good and I loved the avacado on it.F-ing MASSIVE chocolate crepe with white choloate chips on top I received yesterday after bellavista nearby. I must say, for the price, you get your worth, at least in terms of sheer size of ice cream you are getting, that thing looked like a giant burrito.

With that said, I enjoyed it, but not the greatest, you can get better crepe from wanda or dimitri, but this café has personality and would be a nice spot to chill at and people watch once the weather gets warm. For that it's a nice spot to be at.I had baked ziti, meatballs, salad and a roll.  

The ziti noodles were mushy, the top was crispy due to being exposed all day (it's 1pm right now) the flavor was ok.

The meatballs were good.  A tad greasy but good. 

The salad was ok.  The lettuce, tomatoes and cucumber were good.  The dressing was prepackaged, but decent.

The roll was old.  It was stale yesterday.  Not good. 

Without a drink the total was 9 bucks.  For ok food. .. meh.I don't get the hype of this place. I just don't get it at all. 

They have dry sandwiches served on bread that is not moist, but rather more like a store bought piece of french bread. It's totally average at best.Another great addition to the downtown Chandler restaurant scene.   The décor, service, and  food were all wonderful.  They have only been open two weeks and appear to be on their way to being one of the top destinations in DC. Enjoyed a mista salad and two different types of pizza, one veggie, one more traditional.   Our servers were informative, personable, and above all attentive.   If you like a good wood fired pizza, you are going to love this place.I always enjoy the food, service,  and atmosphere of this place. 

Today, however, there chef had a bit of a heavy hand with the pepper.

We will be back as the food and service are greatGreat, fresh Mediterranean food and super friendly service! Definitely a return visit is called for...I  visited the place recently. Love the renaissance style deco,  fairly impressed by the bar. It has good potential for late night hangouts.

The owner(s) are pretty nice, it looks like the restuarant was run by a family. I was greeted right away and took to my seat. From their menu and from previous reviews, it sounds like their early bird breakfest menu has their signature dishes. Wouldn't mind ordering that, but I came in at around 3pm.

The pulled pork sandwich I ordered was really nicely done, the bread was crispy, egg was cooked, meat sauce was rich yet it wasn't soaking the bread , unlike some greasy soggy meals from some Toronto downtown food joints. (which was where I spend most of my lunch time) 

There were a lot of parking space, the restaurant is accessible to drivers.
Overall I am pretty happy with the place, the cakes looked pretty delicious too, but I was only makeing a quick stop, I might try some next time.Oh my gosh, I've been hearing SO MUCH about Tacos El Gordo and I finally got to try it!! This place is PACKED and lines are LONG. I only tried the adobada because that's the one I always keep hearing about and that was the only one with a long line. And even though lines are long, they're super fast and efficient so it doesn't take too long! I forget the pricing but I don't remember it being too terrible or anything. Also the place could be cleaner, but what else do you expect from a joint like this. These tacos are super juicy and flavorful, would definitely recommend!!I feel that pizza is very subjective between the major chains.  All very good and everyone has their personal tastes.  Little Caesars is my favourite!  And for $5.49 for a medium, one topping pizza is an awesome deal!

I've been ordering from this location since I moved to Stouffville about 4 years ago and they're always friendly and quick!  Always!  My orders are always ready in less than 15 min and the pizza is always consistently good.

Love the service, love the pizza, and I love the location!This is a good place to stop before you make your 4 hour trip back to LA. I've always wanted to try this place because of all the hype. Sonics is a rarity in Los Angeles. I like the unique drive-thru ordering style but overall the food was pretty average. Tastes like your regular burger joint. Also, because the server brings your food in their little roller blades you gotta tip. Not that that is a bad thing but... I don't know, I guess I'd rather just go to a restaurant. Every time we head back to LA, we stack up on food from here.I went to Karma's Kitchen yesterday for the 2nd time in two weeks. Before I wrote my review, I wanted to be sure that my wonderful experience with the delicious food on my 1st. time visit with my family; was exactly the same the 2nd time around. Yes, the few new items I tried this time was just as good. I had the father recommend their specialty items on my first visit; then his son Karma recommended the items I tried today. The Momos, Chilli Chicken, Chicken Noodle Soup were all very tasty. If you are into Indian Masala Chai (Tea), you should definitely try theirs, it's excellent! I will be returning to try more & be telling all my "foodie" friends about this family operated restaurant.Whenever we are in North Phoenix on a Friday as we head sometimes head on out of town, we try to make this one last pit stop for one of our favorite vegan places.

Not necessarily on par with the one in central phoenix, but the food is till quite "noble" (a word often used in some of the videos that play on the television in the place).

We have never really gotten to know any of the servers there as they seem to change often, but the service is still efficient. 

The food selection is quite varied, and the soup they give you as part of introductory offering is a distinctly satisfying. 

Two notable differences about this place that is different from the other Loving Hut is that they do offer a lunch buffet, except during the summer. And you have to walk up to the counter to place your order. 

This is a common mistake that new visitors often encounter as they sit down as if they were in a restaurant waiting for a server to come and take their order. 

When you come in, peruse the menu, walk up to the counter, place your order and pay, and the servers will take care of the rest.

After that, enjoy the meal!I really don't know why a lot of people on here were giving really bad reviews of this place I just recently stayed here this weekend and I had no complaints about this place. Of course like everyone already knows you get what you pay for but in my own opinion this place was not what I expected. we checked in the people in the front desk were very nice and helpful. The room was very spacious and clean... rooms were updated had a little kitchen small fridge and microwave  parking was not hard to find AC was working perfectly fine very good location. i happened to leaver some stuff behind i drove back and was concerned with my stuff but they were able to give It to me within 10 min! I definitely not hesitate to make this reservation with ALEXIS PARK RESORT again on my next visit.I love waffles. I love hashbrowns.

This waffle house suuuuuucks. The service is piss poor and they can't get orders straight. I asked for cream for my growing cold coffee twice, I got the wrong order of hashbrowns and no syrup for my waffle.

Keep in mind I am super easy to please (that's what she said). 

Our server kept her head buried down at the register for most of our meal. 

Get it together.

Oh, just drive to the one on the 101 and University.My neighborhood gem! Great vibe, great service, great food - consistently. Steph is the happiest employee I have ever seen! Always have been there for breakfast - can't wait to try dinner there soon.We ordered bear and our glasses had lipstick mark on them. My son ordered coke and it tasted like bleach, their coke machine was not working ok. The service was very mediocre. We ordered 4 different wings and all were cold. Very disappointed. Won't come back again.Carne Asada burritos, a lot of dry over cooked meat and puddles of grease poured out while eating.
Just had to try it once do to ratings?
Filiburtos make a far superior Carne Asada burrito for cheaper!Just was reviewing my receipts from the night of my birthday drinks at DW Alexander and noticed that they were adding 18% tip automatically to the bill without informing me.    Not cool.  I paid the guy $80 on a bill that was $64.49.  Little did I know that the actual tab was $52.70 and they added a $9.49 tip (18%) automatically.   

And they wonder why it's not busy in there?  You pull BS like this and you will end up having fewer and fewer fans.Today I tried the chicken tenders, I'll never again get them. They are the worst. I believe it's just scraps of chicken and the chicken skins that they try to pass as chicken. Very disappointed, I usually get the breasts \/legs I'm usually satisfied with that, but the tenders all I have to say is "don't waste your money".Talked a friend into going to Cornish Pasty for dinner on a Friday night, so off we went to the Tempe location.  We arrived around 7ish and the place was packed, guess that's good sign right?  Only seating available was up by the bar, so off we went.

After checking out the menu I knew I wanted to give the Peppered Steak a try, it had sirloin steak sautéed portabella mushrooms, leeks, roasted zucchini & stilton cheese with a side of peppercorn brandy cream sauce and for a side I ordered some British Chips. The pasty was delish, the flavors blended well together, and the crust was perfectly cooked I was pretty happy with my pasty,,,,,,,

Until I tried a bite of my friends, who ordered the Carne Adovada which was simmered pork in New Mexican red chili stew, Mexican rice, hatch chilies & cheddar and came with a side of sour cream & salsa, Oh My Lawd, that's just a perfect pocket of food! Instantly I had plate envy and no longer wanted mine, which was delish on its own. 

Service was great and friendly, sitting at the bar was cool, and where we sat we were able to watch them prepare some more pastys to be cookedI looooove Yakitori Bar! The servers are super friendly and there is a huge selection of food ranging from yakitori skewers to Korean fusion food. My boyfriend and I ordered the oxtail, kimchi poutine, kimchi flights, pork belly skewers, beef skewers and the cod sandwich... all for the reasonable price of $35. Sang Kim also came by to say hi and asked how the food was. I would come back here again...and again in a heartbeat.Awesome food by an awesome group of guys!

We came by about 930pm (after reading great reviews about them) and it just so happened that they had just closed for the night at 9pm.

However after a short conversation with Josh, tired as he was....this owner gladly fired up the grill and went ahead and made us a couple delicious sandwiches!!!

The Fluff and Nut Sandwich was epic: Grilled buttered wheat toast with nutella, roasted marshmallows, and Nestle Crunch!! Mmmmmmmmm.....

I wish Goodwich the best, only been three weeks and already talking about more locations? That is AWESOME!!

6 Stars!!!!A slightly upgraded version of chuck e cheese's, but with worse pizza (if that's possible) and a real person instead of animatronic rodents performing the "entertainment."I was really craving pizza when i was in downtown LV and I happened to find pizza heaven in Pizza Rock! The slice i had was pepperoni sausage (my FAVORITE) what made it even better the slice was HUGE. It made me so happy and full. The people who worked there were so nice and had a sense of humor. I'd totally go back when i return to Vegas.Such a great find for Vegas!  Service is always on point!  Love the seasonal menus changes, and the fact that there is always still your favorite on the menu.  Will go back every time in in town!The donuts are to die for. The iced vanilla lattes and cold brews are amazing - straight from the keg. The breakfast sandwiches have nothing on Egg Slut. Highly recommend!!!This was our first time eating Vietnamese food and we really enjoyed it!!! We had egg rolls and chicken wings for appetizer both were good. Main course was beef with rice and chicken with rice both very good!!! Meat was very tender and flavor was great. But most of all this is a family place and you can feel the love when you enter the door. Service isn't even the word we felt like we were a guest in their home. My family thanks you for a lovely dinner.Fahrenheit was good. I wouldn't put it in the same category as Lola, Chinato, or L'albatros but it was good. The Kobe beef short rib was not only tender and flavorfull but it was a generous portion size to say the least. Although I enjoyed it I'm not sure that everyone would as it was very salty. I tend to like a lot of salt on my food so it didn't bother me but it would have probably been too much for some people. My girlfriend ordered the shrimp and scallops which were also good, not great. There was A LOT of lemon on it which was over powering. The best things that we had were the bacon wrapped dates. Wow. It was definitely just a sample size as the portion was very small but it was worth it. They were great! The bread and butter was also phenomenal as the butter was very unique. The problem was that there wasn't much bread and the waitress didn't seem to want to give us more. My girlfriend and I went last for a special occasion and it wasn't the best ambiance. It was very loud and we could hear the chefs fighting and swearing at each other which was interesting. I will probably go back eventually but am in no hurry.I've been to many paramount locations and have had excellent food. This particular location was always a little to be desired as the food is often dry, they run out of stock on common items like whole chicken. Recently my family and I ordered mixed grill among other items and everyone got food poisoning. This location is by far much worse and not the same quality as the other locations of paramount, it must have different ownership. The service was also horrible and dis-organized.It was ok. Not like other breakfast places. The service was quick but the food was not good. It had an off taste. I had le gourmet. Pancakes, ham, beans, bacon, sausages and eggs. The pancakes were not fresh and the taste was as if it was defrosted before being put on the plate. Eggs and sausages were ok. Bacon was burnt. We were also handed the check while we were still eating. That was the big turnoff.Our office came here again today and had a WOW service moment. We always talk about great customer service and how far it goes!! Well PV Burger took it to another level today. When realizing they left out 1 of our orders, the owner (I'm assuming) ran across 3 lanes of traffic and hand delivered or tacos to our vehicle.  I can't begin to express our gratitude as our office is about 6 miles away and would have been a bummer to have missed 1 of our 8 meals.My birthday started on a bad note until we came here brunch. I just want to thank head chef Jessica for making my day. 
The food was fresh well seasoned and very eye appealing. This was my first time there and definitely will not be my last. 
The staff was very  personable and the atmosphere was very laid back and comfortable. 
I was taking back on how approachable and accommodating the head chef was. I have allergies and she made me feel safe.
If Sunday brunch is this good i can't wait to come back for dinner. 
Thanks again for the great memories.Friendly staffs and nice dinning environment. The food is not pricy but fresh and delicious. Will come back again.Surprising good for a airport restaurant. I was here for breakfast during a flight delay. The menu is unique. I had a pulled pork scrambled egg breakfast burrito and it was delicious!! It came with breakfast potatoes that were not greasy but has a lot of flavor. I ate at the bar and they have phone chargers at every spot which is convenient when traveling. The service was also very good. The bartender was friendly and attentive.Food was okay not exciting but just your average Mexican food.. Salsa was flat.. needed some kick! Service was good and people were friendly. Atmosphere was nice but right at pit table the mini blinds were broke and a napkin was stuffed to replace the broken slats. It wasn't great but not bad .. just average.I love supporting local business, so it is nice to have such a great shop in the neighborhood to spend my money at!

Whisky and fennel sausages take the prize- wow! 

Fresh cuts of meat, lots of organic choices, great service.My whole family had the buffet, it was delicious! I normally do not like buffets but the food was fabulous. I highly recommend this place!Went on a Friday night around 6pm. Food was great. I had the bam bam chicken and shrimp. It's was amazing I would definitely recommend it if you like the Thai  coconut curry. Our waitress Jasmine was very good, we asked a lot of questions and asked for some recommendations and she did not let us. She kept coming back to check on us and kept our drinks filled. She her self gets a 5 star from  me. I brought back some cheese cake to out room. After the long walk back the cheese cake was just what I needed. Thank you jasmine and the Cheesecake Factory staff for make our experience enjoyableI guess the confused looks on our faces gave it away that we were first-timers! The cashier warmly greeted us and gave us a thorough introduction to the menu. This place does hot dogs (and other things) every way imaginable. All of the hot dogs have cute names. Hubby and I both went for the Char Heel Dog that had house-made chilli, slaw, diced onions (we skipped because we both had to go back to work) and yellow mustard. And you can get an all-beef dog! We both made ours combos; fries with cheese for me and tater tots for the hubby. Everything tasted great. And...they give a discount to CHS employees. Score!Was there with a girlfriend at lunch time today. We both decided on breakfast. We both had their special combo; 2 eggs, 2 pancakes and a choice of a meat or bread or hash browns. I opted for meat so my meal came with 4 bacon strips. My friend got the toast. Great food and service. Coffee good also. Loved the fact that they gave us a pitcher of water and a carafe of coffee so we could indulged and not have to flag down a server.We were there for our anniversary and my birthday, the service was great!  We had the salt and pepper cauliflower for an appetizer and it was fantastic. Salads came out before the appetizer, so that was a bit of a snag, but the server was very personable and offered free dessert for my birthday. We had the fried Oreos - they were fantastic. For our dinner we had the seafood hotpot. It was very good, the fish was cooked just right and the veggies were al dente.Tonight, on .60 cent boneless night, i, and three friends, came in to enjoy one of our favorite spots. Our server's name was 'Bri', and although she was a very sweet girl, the service was absolutely atrocious. Not only that, but when my boyfriend and i received our wings, they were not only cold, but I was missing 5 lemon pepper and when they finally came out, they had about 15% lemon pepper seasoning, and I had to wait about 15 mins for Bri to realize i was trying to get her attention and ask for extra seasoning. Completely disappointed and questioning whether or not I will ever visit another Bdubs again.Pad Thai was not very good, honestly tastes like noodles & ketchup. Made me doubt the authenticity of this place. Ambience and service was pretty nice, though.

Green tea came from in teabag form, not exactly what I was expecting. Spicy Thai noodles were decent. Of the four noodle dishes we sampled this one was the best but you need to like spicy things. Eggplant was actually quite good. But avoid the Pad Thai at all costs!Note to self: take your time working through the Szechuan menu on subsequent visits.  There's a lot going on here, and you may have to dig for it.   As my Yelp pal Elizabeth M. discovered, "There is a secret . . . Chinese menu that you ask for (you will initially he handed a sushi menu)....just ask the waiter\/waitress . . . You won't regret it."  Amen, sister.

We, like Asha B., started with the Couples Delight which is a chilled, spicy mixture of beef, tendon and other stuff topped with cilantro. Think like all the interesting things you add to a bowl of beef pho and you'll get it.  Pow.  What a start.  If you don't like spice, avoid.  The dried green bean entree we sampled is a meal all to itself.  So damn good.

So . . . we ordered some of this, and some of that until we cried Uncle and loaded up the rest for home.   I recognize this place is not for the uninformed or unadventerous.  One poor soul Yelped, "The Chinese food, which you have to ask to order from, is weird. Lots of "stomachs", "intestines" and duck "blood" entrees, and a vegetable called "rape" (not kidding)."  Bless her heart.  No General Tsao here.

For us it was a culinary trip down memory lane from our time in China.  In the mood for different stuff served in a more traditional Szechuan style, language barriers and all?  Way up on my "Give 'em a whirl" meter.  Enjoy.  Xiexie.Soto is so amazing ! I always enjoy going in for lunch and chatting it up with him!! Check out there specials!Ew, this place is disgusting. We stayed in the fantasy suite building in the "pool suite"-but it would have been more aptly named 'nightmare suite.' Old, dirty, broken... And way overpriced. You couldn't pay me to stay here again.

The whole place feels old, dirty, cheap and trashy. I think you get the point. AVOID!Ugh I love this place it's so good!! I feel fantastic after coming here if you are around one make sure you stop in!Tried their Utopia burger. What can I say about it? Hmm....it is only the most majestic and best tasting burger I've had in my life. It was like eating freedom brought down by a flaming eagle the size of a mountain and served on a platter made of thunder clouds. Unfortunately, nothing in this life is perfect and even the Utopia burger is subject to criticism. The problem was that it had so many toppings and meat, handling the burger required so much dexterity that it would probably require its own certificate course. After much practice, I've managed to perfect this art and can fully enjoy everything this burger has to offer. I have to admit, my life has gotten exponentially better since then. Oh it also includes a serving of fries that deserve a review of their own.4 stars based on the sangria alone.

Order this motherfucker by the PITCHER, without apology.

If you can sit out on the patio, so much the better. if not, grab a comfortable booth near the bar.Edwin's completely wowed us!

We didn't know what to expect. Heard great things and there were vegan options  so we tried Edwin's out for our anniversary dinner.

I got the horseradish salmon - I was nervous the horseradish would be too overbearing, but it was perfectly balanced with a sauce. Boyfriend got the vegan Mac n cheese and the tofu dish and he was impressed.

What stood out the most was the service. I've been to dinner at a lot of nice places, but have never had service this perfectly coordinated. To the point where when I got up to use the restroom, I came back to my food covered with a silver lid to keep it warm and my napkin perfectly folded and placed back on the table. The waitress was aware of the second I returned, immediately uncovered my food and put the napkin on my lap. The owner walked me to the restroom, didn't. Just point to where it was. Great food, service, and an excellent cause.I order their food as take-outs once in a while when I'm craving a tasty pilaf or chicken tabaka.Came here last Monday and had an amazing meal for Chef Brent's pop up dinner. Community style seating lets you get to know your table-mates. Outrageously delicious food. The kimchi perogies were absolutely to die for!! Shrimp were amazing as well. We often dine out, this was one of our favorite meals! Can't wait for the next one! Great service as well, hats off to you and your team!!Originally, I wanted to meet a friend at another restaurant, but they were under construction, so Daily Dose (DD) showed up on yelp nearby and we thought we would give it a try. So glad we found it! Our cocktails were delicious - and there were plenty of specialty cocktails! I had a bagel sandwich that had bacon, eggs, tomato, etc. I don't remember what DD called it, but it was delicious. The bagel was soft, making it easy to keep it as a sandwich instead of a bagel with breakfast falling out of it. So good! My friend got rancheros. She was quite pleased with the twist they had on it - and I can tell you it looked delicious! Not only was everything tasty, but the food came out so faster than it took me to decide what I wanted to eat!  I'd definitely like to go back some time, as all of the food that I saw coming out looked and smelled quite tasty!Holy cow.

Got the Saigon egg rolls to start. First, it's hilarious that they said it was with a side of papaya salad. It's a garnish. The papaya taste was barely discernible and overall didn't have the lunch or tang of any papaya salad I've ever eaten. If anything, it was watery and if this is the same as the salad portion, I would stay away from it. The egg rolls are weird tasting with no flavor at all. This is atypical from regular egg rolls, I get it... But it just doesn't taste good.

Entrees were udon chicken special and bf got Sizzling Shrimp. 

For both of us, we werent asked spice levels so we did not think of anything of it but holyyyyy molyyyy they were both SO spicy. I just ate what noodles I could abdllnd avoided the rest.

Yeah yeah I get it, it's Thai food and I think even the Sizzling Shrimp had spicy in description. But both bf and I are not strangers to spice...There's another Thai place we frequent. But we both could not finish our plates; there so much chili on my plate I had to scrape it aside. We're not those people that have their entrees redone though I'm sure they wouldn't mind doing it.  Please be forewarned!!

The rest of the menu seemed uninspiring and you can pretty much get every item on there elsewhere.

Lack of stars for disappointing appetizer, dismal menu, and high price for what you get. Seriously, you can get a lot of these items for a lot cheaper and it would be better tasting at  local Chinese and Vietnamese places. Also factored just a little bit is the crazy spice levels.... Just a little bit though, because we could have said something but they really should have been more clear on.I've been looking for real Szechuan food in the valley for many months. I feel like I finally found perfect and authentic Szechuan Chinese restaurant for me! We wanted to have none menu food but they made it special for us. It was very pleasant. :)Great traditional lao beef lap.  I requested it to not be cooked in the traditional style.   Was just like my mom's home made.   Lao sausages was good could use more herbs and Lemon grass. Really authentic lao food.A friend and I ordered a pizza sub, "loaded" fries, and a salad. The order took 1 hour and 20 minutes to arrive, even though we are a couple miles away. The delivery driver did text me and ask where I lived, though all he said was "Hey where are u." All the food was cold, and the sub had a rubbery type texture to it, indicating someone microwaved it. The "loaded" fries barely had any toppings, and again, were cold. I will try their pizza before I make a decide whether or not to eat here again.there was 5 of us, 1 filipino dude (me), 1 Vietnamese, 2 white guys and 1 mexican guy.  So you know how the in thing now is for a group of friends wiht different races that we tease jokingly about being that race...And we especailly make fun of each others accents...anyways...i guess one of the white guys was reading the menu with an asian accent, hilarious but maybe not a good idea in an asian restuarant.  
Good thing no one heard us. Thought i would share that story.

So i tried the crispy duck which my coworker was raving about since he first tried it.

I'm not the most adventorous eater but that duck was awesome....
we also tried the papya salad..YES! Make sure u get that.
make sure you pick your spicey level, coz that drunken noodles we got was real spicey (no deduction on stars because that was my fault)

we also got the prawns tempura..good starter.

But i have to go back to the duck.  When you go to your local park and see ducks, you will see them differently, I SWEAR!  I can't wait till the ducks start flying north coz i will have my weapon ready to go.I went to the Farm Kitchen today after hiking South Mountain. I must say, I was not thoroughly impressed. The way the set up their line is odd and confuses people which makes the process not as fluid as it could be. They make you enter by the registers, which is apparently where you order food, but first you must go to the other side of the building to get drinks, but if you want water, it's serve yourself and behind you....kind of convoluted. The food is also overpriced. My step mom got a sandwich and I got a side salad and a cup of soup and it was 25$. I had their vegetarian soup of the day, which was a white bean and green chili soup. The soup tasted alright, but the beans were a bit underdone IMO, they still were pretty chewy, not soft like they usually are. The salad was alright, but a salads a salad. My step mom said her sandwich was fine, but nothing special. The good part about this restaurant is that it's on the farm and the scenery is beautiful. Despite this, I think that Morning Glory is much better and will most likely go there next time.Walked by this place and stopped for a Bloody Mary. Very unique flavor but one of the best.Amazing meal,  food was fresh,  fast and excellent tasting. Service was efficient and the price was reasonable. Great experienceAbsolute best chicken tenders I've ever had.   Even the fries are the best!    Awesome sauces, and they are always very generous portions.  Anytime I want to treat myself to some good fried food, this is my go-to place.   Even their drink machine is a notch above the rest (one of those 100 combination types)My high school was right by here, so we would run here everyday for lunch.  Now, probably because we were annoying high school students, the service wasn't the greatest, but my parents say that every time they go, the staff is lovely.  As a student I would always get the veggie platter, which included potatoes, side of rice and a greek salad.  The salad was always great and I'm actually craving the rice right now.  Just a tip for those non-students: The student rush is during 11:40-12:30, so its best not to go during those times!You ever walk into a bar for the first time and say to yourself, " Oh, I'll be back here again...maybe tomorrow night..." ?   That.

And that was before we even ate the food.

Our charming and expert bartender Aaron was fun to watch, solicitous about our likes and dislikes, cocksure in his mixing and his opinions, and who skilfully entertained us while also leaving us to our conversation.  The modified classic cocktail menu was fun to peruse and the Last Word cocktail I had was gorgeous, complex and sent me to dinner with a lovely little hum in my head....

I read about the foie gras Creme brûlée and it seemed like a must-have, but I had hesitations.  I don't like whimsical food, nor do I like food that tries to emulate something opposite (for instance, a dessert out of meat.)   Aaron strongly recommended it though,  as did our server James (more on him later).  What the hell, I was game....

Rather than rhapsodize about it here, read the other poetic odes contained in these reviews, and they are accurate.  I would like to add though that it is NOT whimsical food.  It is not a play on dessert.  It is an appropriate and accurate expression of the aspects that make foie gras beautiful, the texture and delicate flavor and the mouth feel.  Yum.  Aaron told me to order one to share  but I ate more than my half, and wanted more. 

My girlfriend and I weren't hungry enough to order the tasting menu, so we picked two appetizers and split an entree.  I will return another time for the tasting menu, properly hungry.  

The poached egg was a great example of what a skilled chef can do with a few perfect ingredients.  Shellfish and sweetbreads were not going to pass the lips of my dinner mate, so James, our attentive, funny server steered us to the Iberico pork loin which was perfectly prepared.  The amuse bouche was tar tare (bright and delicate) and the chef sent out a beautiful tiny hot chocolate with coconut to end our meal. 

We skipped dessert and went back to Aaron, guessing correctly that asking him to make us something alcoholic and dessert-y would be a task he was up to...he didn't tell us a name for it, but it was chocolate, cold, foamy and perfect.

I haven't mentioned the bread, the wine, the sommelier, the beautiful decor in the dining room that is simultaneously hip and comfortable, the  pace at which the food came to the table, etc., all very good. 

I left Sage wanting more.

(And yes, I came back the next night for more.)The food isn't worth how you're treated by the staff. My fiance and I attempted to go for breakfast on a Saturday morning around 9:45.  He was picking his car up from a dealership just down the street while I went on to get a table. There was around a 10 minute wait.  I waited for my name to be called and was then seated.  After sitting down for a minute or so, a waitress walked by and told me if my whole party wasn't there I wasn't allowed to be seated. I told her my second person would be there any second and I was going to call to see how close he was.  She insisted again that I get out of the booth. As I was calling, she again told me numerous times that I needed to leave the booth.  I totally understand the concept of seating full parties in a restaurant that can get very very busy. However, I wasn't told that or asked if all of the people in my party were present until I had already been seated by someone on their staff.  At that point, the restaurant should take responsibility for their mistake, not kick me out of a booth I was already sitting in.  I left and took my business to Waffles Incaffeinated, who was more than happy to take my money, and by the time I drove the one driveway over, my fiance had arrived.  For a small establishment I was really disappointed in their lack of understanding they'd made the mistake in seating me in the first place.We only went through the drive through today but from the second we were welcomed by the person on the other end of the intercom Desiree.. we felt that it was amazing customer service!!! She was very sweet and funny and we were a bit difficult with our order but not for one second felt any annoyance in her tone of voice she was just very pleasant all around and thought she should be noticed for it! These days it's hard to find good customer service and she had it! She made the experience awesome for us and food is amazing and fresh!Great food, Great Frozen hot chocolateThey offered us free soup with our meal in this extremely cold weather, which I think is the sweetest thing ever. We all got the cream of mushroom and it was pretty good.Best kept secret in East Deer!  All grilled burgers and meat - cant beat it!  Nothing like it!Went here for a friends birthday. Great Ambiance and Good Vibes All Around! I Recommend This Place And Will Make My Way Back SoonDecent poke bowls and boba, and it's nice to find a place that offers both! Their boba itself was good, however I found their matcha milk tea a little powdery tasting. Also, their poke bowls were on the smaller side, and they don't mix the greens with the sauce like all other places I've been to. I also wish they had flatter containers that would allow you to mix everything together, because since it was a little narrow it was difficult and I had to eat everything separately. Overall not bad, but I've had much better!I try something new every time I go! Their Gyros and Falafel are my favorite!! Must try!! So good!This was an awesome treat. They have some unique pizzas. We got the cheeseburger pizza which wad amazing. This place has one of the best thin crusts I have ever had. The crust is foldable and not all stale like most thin cracker crusts. Will be revisiting.Stopped in at 8 am for a $1 sausage and a coffee. Very clean. Friendly counter lady. Not busy. Relaxing.As someone who has had authentic Chinese food but also enjoys American-Chinese food, this place is just fine. I've only ever gotten take out from this place, so here are the dishes I recommend:

1. I enjoy the Chongqing dry hot chicken, it's like spicy small bits of fried chicken, half meat, but the other half of the container is red peppers. This is often too spicy for most other people I enjoy dining with.  There are Schezwan peppercorns in this, which make your tongue go slightly numb and feel lemony. So good!  You'll probably feel iffy ordering it, because the name sounds like a bad, racist Rosie O'Donnell joke. 

2. Eggplant in garlic sauce. Huge fan of this vegetarian dish. So flavorful. The eggplant has the wonderful firm but slimy texture. 

3. My partner loves getting the salt and pepper chicken. It's small bits of fried chicken, similar to the chongqing chicken, but this dish is sweet but black peppery. Always a hit. 

4.  Lastly, we like to get veggie hor fun, because the name applies to us, and the noodles are so wide and delightfully chewy!

I am only giving this place 3 stars because the portion sizes to go seem small to me, for the price. The food has never wowed me, just been alright \/ good enough to go back to them.Great happy hour- extends all day Sundays. We went as a small group, sat on the heated patio (50 degrees out) and were toasty with the outdoor heaters and fireplace. Great, cheap happy hour, $20 buys you a bottle of pretty good wine and a pizza or antipasto plate. Service was great, enjoyed the crispy thin crusted pizza, and the antipasto tray was very tasty. Will definitely return! 
Ps- Valet parking was a ice touch!Levi easily translated my Starbucks lingo to English and I received the best white mocha I've ever had. My wife's iced blended mocha was excellent because it wasn't too sweet.  Although I don't understand how something could be not sweet enough, she loved it!!I ordered #16 Pho and an order of tofu spring rolls to go. Everything was packaged very nicely and tasted absolutely delicious. I ordered the large thinking I was somehow going to finish it on my own, but I was wrong the servings are huge and now I have delicious leftovers. I loved the crispy tofu inside the spring rolls with the peanut sauce. The broth from the pho was outstanding. I will definitely be coming back here.Love this place! Food is authentic. Taste is exactly what I remembered from back home. Very friendly staff tooBrought back memories of living on the East Coast. After many a gig & a late night of entertaining, White Castle was the place to go for some grub. Cool spot on Fremont  Street in old Las Vegas. Decent food at a fair price. Will return.I would never have entertained thoughts of dining at this very modest appearing vegetarian restaurant, located in a sketchy section of downtown, except for its many favorable reviews.  

My wife ordered a Latin Tude (a burrito filled with black beans, refried beans, vegan cheese, onions, garlic, tomatoes, roasted potatoes with poblano peppers) while I chose, being a romantic, the My Love (2 burrito's with sun dried tomatoes, Cuban black beans, vegan cheese, spinach, roasted garlic potatoes and peppers).  We were told the food would take 30 minutes to prepare and were encouraged to have an appetizer.  In retrospect, I am glad we didn't because each of our dishes could have, should have, been shared.  Both were beautifully plated and delicious, but we ended up taking half of each with us.  Prices are relatively high, but so is the quality.We had our first dinner date there, and it was great 3 years ago. We have been back occasional, and it used to be great.
A few weeks ago we had been there for dinner, and my rigatoni had not been drained, and my tomato sauce was diluted with water. I didn't say a word.
Yesterday we came back for dinner. I ordered the Bow tie Special. After waiting for nearly 30 minutes my bow tie were so under cooked that I had to return it. I understand al dente, but they were almost raw. The waitress explained that all pasta is cooked fresh to order and it might take a while to have my dish redone and offered a different kind of pasta with the dish. I asked for rigatoni, which was a big mistake. After another 15 minutes I got my dish, the rigatoni were under cooked, possibly acceptable for some, but not for me. I was tired of waiting and complaining again, so I ate the sauce with a spoon, but left all pasta on the plate. By the way - the sauce was out of this world!!! In the end the waitress took that dish off our bill.
My final rate: If you own an Italian restaurant, you have to have knowledge of the simplest basics, which is cooking pasta.
I am not going back!!!Believe the hype about Chelsea's Kitchen. When in Phoenix, this is the only restaurant that we MUST go to. There are only two negatives I can think of...the parking situation and the lack of reservations.

In the summer we'll eat inside but the patio is a must when the weather is nice. You have to get the tuna tartare & guacamole. It's one of the best appetizers you'll eat. I always get the short rib taco platter and leave with a doggie bag every time. They'll even give you extra house-made tortillas for your left overs! I've also had the brussels sprout salad, the kale and quinoa salad, the green chili burger and the ahi tuna taco platter. You really can't go wrong.

On the way out, don't forget to grab a freshly baked sea salt cookie!Small little place located in a shopping plaza with friendly service and good reasonably priced food. The mister and I ordered: Tenders and waffles, Sriracha bowl and Lychee lemonade. Everything was good and the lychee lemonade was so refreshing, free refills! Check this place out of you want fast good food without all the fancy smanchy stuff.Oh. My. God!  The food here was phenomenal!  This was my first time here and I am in love with the food.  I met a friend here for dinner after finding out about this place through Yelp.  We ordered the decadent lobster bisque fries to share (totally amazing!) and a bottle of the JK's Scrumpy Organic Hard Cider (delicious!).  For our entrees we decided to share the crab stuffed salmon and the lobster mac and cheese.  I really wish that I had taken pictures of the food before we dived in but we were both hungry and the food looked so delicious (and it was) that by the time I thought to take a picture our food was already half eaten.  We left with happy bellies and no doggie bags but the portions were generous and had I eaten lunch I most definitely would have taken food home.  There was nothing on the dessert menu that appealed to either of us as it was pretty much just cheesecake, but that was the ONLY downside to our experience.  The atmosphere is relaxed and the place is spacious but you could definitely go dressed up a bit or casual and not be out of place.  The service was above excellent - if you go, ask to be seated in Kevin's section - he was AMAZING!  I will definitely be returning to  Luke Wholey's Wild Alaskan Grille and will highly recommend it to my friends and family.  I love it!Good chicken and nice sized portions. Don't get confused by big lineups which might be for the next door theatreFavorite pizza hands down. I have tried quite a few of their special pizzas and loved them all. I am not one for plain cheese pizza, but their "cheese pizza" is olive oil, mozzarella\/romano, the sauce, and fresh basil and it is the most amazing, perfect pizza flavor! They are doing the basics right and anything would be good on their pizza!If it's Wednesday, it's Bang Bang Shrimp Day!  Somehow, every time we are in Vegas that thought passes through my mind and I act on it!  Even better is when we make it to Bonefish Grill for their awesome Happy Hour, and Bang Bang Shrimp is just $6.  I contemplated the well drinks, but chose a Cadillac Margarita, and was rewarded with a good dollop of Grand Marnier floating amid the tequila.  My honey ordered the Wagyu Beef Sliders, four perfect petite burgers, and slid them down with a delightful lemonade.  We sat at the bar, since Happy Hour was just winding down, and had some of the best, most individualized service we have ever had in Vegas by a very professional bartender.  We did notice that he was on top of things at the bar, as well as seeing that everyone received their preferred order.  
This is a must stop for each and every Vegas trip!This place is great! Delicious food, excellent service. The shrimp was cooked perfectly and the rice was amazing.Mom and Dad got takeout, I got the leftovers\/what fell on the floor. How excellent!! I could tell that the rents liked it, they teared up while eating (they are also pretty wimpy when it comes to spice). I'd love if they ordered from here again! Recommend the chicken sag, my personal favorite. Walk by delicious smells on penn ave are free!!After hitting for a couple hundo at the Blackjack table, the wife and I decided to splurge on dinner in a venue where we knew the decor and ambiance was going to add a good 40% to the tab, if you know what I mean.  Was it worth the extra scratch?  As the Kool-Aid Man famously yells, "Ohhhh, Yeeaaahhhh!"

Every course we ordered was mouth-watering delicious, from the Sea Scallops to the Filet and Lobster Tail to the complimentary Chocolate Cake I received for my birthday.  All of our items were cooked to perfection, and the flavors were incredible.

If you get lucky at a table game, or hit a jackpot on a machine, treat yo'self!  You won't be disappointed!We have been to so many Indian Cuisines and this one is the BEST over all! Food is booming with flavor and the employees are grade A with customer service! Definitely coming back here again!If you enjoy New Mexican food, this is the place for you!  Great green chili. Margaritas are very good as well.  Look forward to going back!I went here right after I moved to Phoenix and was very impressed at the food and even more impressed with the service. Seriously, some of the best service I have ever received. The entire staff was friendly and happy. You could tell that they all loved their jobs, and wanted their customers to come back. We were there towards the end of the day so they even gave us a few cookies to go. We will be back and I would highly recommend Cafe Cornucopia.We went to Timo Wine Bar to try it out for my birthday dinner before a show last Saturday night. We arrived around 5pm and were seated on the patio immediately. The patio is super cute and has great ambiance. We felt very comfortable right away and it only got better from there. I was pleased to find out it was still happy hour until 6pm and ordered glass of wine. We started with the anti-pasta platter based on our server's recommendation. It was delicious! We asked for a bit more bread because we gobbled up the few pieces it came with very quickly. Our server brought more right away and we (mostly me) ate every yummy bit on the platter. We ordered the wood fired chicken and the loaded Italian pizza for entrees. Both were delicious also, but most of the pizza came home with us - too full. Overall our service was fantastic, the food was great, and we will be back!Went here with a friend for dinner. I had the beef brisket which was very good and tender. I did not really care for the sides. I had coleslaw and onion rings. The hush puppies were good though. The servers and cashiers are very friendly. I would definitely recommend this place. It is a hidden secret.Be Careful !!   
Went Thursday Late afternoon
Nice Atmosphere
Our Server was Angela
My wife asked for a glass of house red  wine
Angela said " We don't have house wines"
She suggested the featured wine,
To our surprise it was $15 for a very small glass
all the wines on the menu were $7-$8 dollars 
She never mentioned "the Drink special wines at $5 at glass available
We got hustled
We also had the Fritto Misto
To call it Very Average is being generous
WE wisely didn't stay for DinnerI love eating here. I usually order the "Hitman" which is the chili cheese frito pie. Her chili is amazing and she makes it herself. I get it topped with onion, jalapenos, mustard and I always have her add a chopped up Saberet hot dog on top (for an additional charge). The serving size is great for the price. I paid about $6.50 including tax, but I've paid a lot more for a lot less many times. Besides, the quality is well worth it. The order is about $4.25 without the hot dog. She usually has some sort of special going, as well. Today it was a Cyclone Hot Dog, Fries and a Drink for $6.50 before tax. Not bad, I just prefer to just go ahead and pay for whatever it is I am in the mood to eat, despite the deals.

The owner is always very nice and friendly and she takes care to make sure she gets the order exactly as you want it. Definitely one of my favorite lunch spots and one of the best stands in the food court.Very pretty atmosphere. The food is very good and the staff friendly. It is one of my favorite places to eat in Vegas.Umami's Beer Garden was great! Outside but in the shade, great atmosphere and our server Mandy was fantastic! She gave great suggestions on food and her drink recommendation (the Lolita) was spot on - Watermelon + Cucumber deliciousness. We'll definitely be back!Its a bit pricey however it is worth it in my opinion.  I have never had a bad meal, and if you feel like a burger and a beer, get here before 3 to get the widest selection.  Also they have a dog friendly patio, and a doggie bowl with a chicken or beef option.  This place is great for a date night.Fairly decent airport. My Uber dropped me off in front. They have one security check point which is a mess. The TSA staff here didn't care to move fast or try to be efficient. In many other airports I fly out of, security has gotten much better throughout the years. Once through security you have to walk to your gate area or take a tram. Free WiFi that works some of the time depending where you are. 

Post security there are many food, drink, bars, and coffee shop options. I was able to find a decent breakfast for under $10 or for $15 I got a full breakfast. 

Cons: The Uber pick up experience is terrible. Unlike many other airports you don't get your Uber from the arrival (drop off area). There are also no signs when you land telling you where to Uber pick up area is. Only when I asked did they tell me that I had to take a tram. Then snake my way around to a parking garage, then go to the 5th floor to see the Uber pick up area. 

Limited charging by the gate area.I was recently introduced to the lair of lusciousness known as Totties by my good buddy (and fellow Yelper) Alexander C.  Alex had been to Totties Asian Fusion II very recently and was so impressed (believe me, this guy is discerning, so for him to give something a thumb's up -- you'd best believe it) that he organized an outing\/evening for like 10 big ol' bears of men for a sake bomber happy hour & dinner.   See Alexander's review for exact details and descriptions of what we ordered and ate, but I'm going to make this review short & sweet.

Tottie's rocks. The service was impeccable.  Tottie herself came to our table and made special recommendations on food.  I've never felt so attended to by a restaurateur before.  This lady knows her stuff in the front of the house, but even more so, she can cook her petite Asian ass off.  EVERYTHING we had was amazing and her Thom Kha Kai soup blew my socks off.  I crave....for days...

The parking lot's a little wonky now during construction, but it's a small price to pay for this level of amazing food.  We were 10 hungry heffers when we arrived (not one of us under 200 pounds, so you know we like to eat) and no one walked outta the place hungry or needing ANYTHING.  Service & food to the max.  

I applaud Tottie for opening a second killer location and I thank Alex for introducing us to this amazing pocket of awesomeness deliciousness!I went to Sal's last weekend to celebrate my birthday and the experience lived up to the hype! When my wife and I arrived I was glad I didn't invite anyone else because this place is small\/intimate.  We were told it would be 40 minutes so we went next door to Johnson Public House for a beer.  About 20 minutes into my imperial porter I got a call that the table was ready so I slammed the beer and headed back to Sal's buzzed and ready to eat!

We each got a small specialty pie. I did the forza,with ricotta, pepperoni, Calabrian chilis, and whole cloves of roasted garlic!  The flavor was big, the heat and sweet worked well with the ricotta, crust was buttery and the garlic was so good. This one may not be the best pick for first dates or vampires.  My wife went with the mapache with carnitas, poblano peppers, potatoes and some other ingredients that are escaping me. The flavors worked well and this one had a very nice level of heat.

They have a rotating tap list featuring local and out of state beers.  I went with the Boulder brewing shake porter on nitro which was essentially a liquid tootsie roll and I really enjoyed it.

Service was attentive and friendly and combined with the food made for an awesome birthday dinner!I've eaten good tacos at Chelsea market in ny and these are as the name suggest Bomb!!I was very disappointed in the meal I had last Sunday at the Waterfront Long Horn. Looking for a good steak or prime rib. I had a choice of a Outback, my usual favorite, or a Texas Road House. Me and my Dad picked the Long Horn. It was mediocre at best. He had the  16oz. Prime Rib, it was quite fatty and chewy. I had the 14 oz. Rib Eye. I ordered it medium and it came out medium well. Not liking to complain , even though was very chewy for a rib eye I ate half of it. When the waiter asked how was my steak I said "ok" and that it was over cooked. He sent the manager over and the manager berated me because I did not say somethings earlier. He did however give me half off my steak. The chowder was too salty, the Cesar Salad had too much dressing on it but the Parmesan Spinach and Mushroom appetizer was very good. Also thumbs up on the strawberry shortcake was a highlight. For a $75.00 meal for two I did not feel satisfied with the experience. I would probably not rush back to any Long Horn if other options were available.The Sunday brunch is absolutely to die for!  I love their food, service and ambiance. It is definitely the best restaurant in Ballantyne Village. What a gem!Nice bar, clean, new and not smelly but as I sit here watching the NBA championship game they have music on and not the volume for the game. I won't be back for another big sports event for sure. Wings and apps are good. But again, we came for the sporting atmosphere and it's just not here.We celebrated our son's 22nd birthday under the supermoon next to a lovely fireplace. Of course it's always fun to start a meal here with those yummy, gooey, sweet sticky buns, although they should finish with them as a dessert. I had the blue crab, ahi tuna & avocado stack with an orange reduction garnish for entree which was perfect in portion for me. The crab was tasty, however, there weren't many distinguishable chunks. Tuna was excellent. Bday boy's tequila jumbo shrimp were indeed enormous as advertised and delicious. Other entrees were standard fare-braised beef short ribs and a roasted pork loin. Lovely little white chocolate pyramid bday dessert with candle topped off a very nice dinner.It was a great fresh bagels that I every taste they have different cream cheeses.  my husband had a sandwich of ham and cheese he love it they make bagel fresh everydayI'd been to the other location in Kensington Market, so I was super jazzed to try this new version out. The tuna melt is still amazing, and they're doing gluten free fish AND chips now! That's good for fish eaters. As well, chip eaters will be pleased to know there are options, especially if they are gluten free themselves. Get in here and relish the goodness.Bentley's was great! I purposed to my girlfriend on Friday night and finished our special day off for dinner here. 
The food was excellent! I got the bourbon filet, and it was incredible. My fiancé (weird to say) got the Hawaii special. Halibut with pork belly. Service was great too. I I highly recommend this restaurant. Great for special occasions.Good food. They have health options. The kids liked it, we passed on the Carnegie science museum cafeteria. We walked down the riverfront it was nice.The service was extremely unprofessional and our order was missing several items. The food quality was still good, but no one seemed to know what they were doing.So I went here last night because my friend got married. YAAAAAYYYYY!!! Her hubby's boss got them a room here. When I first drove up, I didn't know what to expect. I went to look for parking, but one of the valet drivers said that it would be better to valet park so that I would not have to worry about my car and they only worked for tips because they take care of their customers free of charge. The customer service was fine.. As I walked in, I saw different statues and pictures from many artists everywhere from the ceiling to all around the hotel even in the rooms. I met up with the bride and groom, took some pics, and then went to the restaurant for dinner with them. She had the Shrimp scampi ($18), he had a siegel burger with extra tomatoes and fries ($9), and I had the lobster BLT with avocado, bacon, and a side salad topped with Caesars dressing ($12). The sandwich alone was huge for me.. I was the last to finishing eating. Soon after we went to the bar portion of the hotel, but it was crowded and we were asked to get up from the table that we were sitting at because it was reserved for another party. Then we (she and I) went to the room and had a couple of hennessy shots. We tried to drink the champagne, but it tasted like vomit and smelled like piss. GROSSSSSSSSSS! As we were drinking, her hubby went to the store to get more hennessy and coke for us to drink, but then she changed her mind and called him to come back because by then, we were planning to go the strip... In the hallway, I felt like a giant because I could actually touch the ceiling. LOL.. We went back downstairs and left to go to Caesars Palace!Great prices. Meat was juicy and perfect. Great selection of different salsas and sauces at the salsa bar.Yuck!  I've been to Tasti D-lite several times and have always found it to be below average.  The taste and quality of the yogurt is poor and they charge a premium price for a very mediocre product.  There are so many better choices in the area!!!I can't add much other than this place was a great experience. In my brief time in Cleveland, I have been really glad to find some of the cultural variety that I have found elsewhere. I thought everything was on par with the few times I've tried dim sum in the past. 

Overall, I thought the restaurant was clean, the service was on top of everything, and the prices for dim sum were low. The servers come around with carts filled with steamed pork, seafood, or tofu pastries and there are some other things on the menu that I didn't see being carted around. I laughed as they tried to unload everything onto the table, so be sure to let them know when enough is enough! I'm really looking forward to going back.Food was ok but the experience was very bad!!!!!
The waitress herself added unusual amount of money as tip ! Should she do that? She has no idea that tip is given by customers based on her service! Her behavior was cheating! It was even worse since she said no tip was added after my wife, an account ant noticed unusual difference from our order! Even if 20% tip was added would not match cost. When we asked to re calculate based on menu, she immediately admitted added a wrong amount to the check! Really just a mistake?! 

We don't recommend this restaurant! If you go anyway, examine your check carefully!Have been eating here since they opened a few years ago. Great food and service. Very friendly and helpful. Carnitas are off the hook. Recommend this to anyone wanting good real Mexican food.Loved this place! First time there was a date night with husband and since we have a new baby it doesnt happen very often. Food was amazing, service was fast and the manager gave us a free dessert in celebration of the special night. Will be going back for sure.Doesn't require reservations like 360 does, so it was nice spontaneously walking in and getting a window seat. (There were a few window seats left on a Saturday afternoon)

The food isnt cheap, but the portions are pretty big. And the quality of the food was perfect. 

Knocked off a star because it took a while to get a waiter. But our waiter that we actually DID get was VERY sweet :) Too bad a few walked by before him and completely ignored us...Really pretty decent for CLT. Large selections and conveniently located on Central. The beef balls, shrimp and pork dim sum are all very delicious. I especially order congee with salt soaked duck eggs to go as I really enjoy them. The tea is hot, while not the best, is a good compliment to the dim sum. Yang chow fried rice and fried three precious are meeting with my expectations! The traffic is wild over the weekend and slow during the week except for dinner.  Always having plenty of parking around is a plus to the experience! :) will return again soon.fantastic perfect pho and other viet favourites.

fast efficient smart service

definitely try te tay ho salad

also try the phos with vegetables- the vegetables are grilled and give a wonderful flavour the to already great broth.I came here with a group of friends. We had made a reservation but still had to wait an hour for a table. If we had not made reservations, the wait would have been 4.5 hours instead.

For food, customers go out to get whatever sides they want and then come back. Once seated, servers will come around with meats and ask what you want. What I really didn't like about this was that the servers only had small skewers of meat and would almost never be able to serve a chunk of meat to each person at my table. It was not the huge meat eating experience I was expecting. Once you've tried a number of items, servers will ask what you want to come by but this is a lie. They are unlikely to actually bring what you want to the table. On the bright side, the food here is great. My favourite would have to be the cinnamon pineapple.

During the dining experience, Copacabana will have the occasional dancers coming around as well as a performer on the Chinese silks. This was a great distraction from my hunger when waiting for more meat.This place is awesome!!! Our new go to for Mexican food. We went for lunch and they were BUSY. The manager sat us right away and the server was right behind him. Service was super fast especially considering how busy they were and very friendly. Lunch portions were huge and tasted fantastic! Can't wait to get me some more Nandos, we'll be back for dinner soon!The service was great. I was seated right away and everyone kept up with my table. The music and atmosphere were good too. The blue cheese burger I ordered sucked terribly. There was more shredded lettuce then burger and no blue cheese or bacon. When I called the waiter back he said it's cooked into the dry ass patty they served. So disappointed, the did bring me some blue cheese to put in it but come on. It was the driest hockey puck of q burger and if I wasn't 9 months pregnant and starving at the time I would've sent it back and ordered something else.Need to stop by when I can stay awhile.

I need a need a friend and have 30 minutes to spare so I thought I'd stop in at Cactus Tavern and I'm so glad I did

Cactus Tavsrn is a nice comfortable place. Great environment. Food is excellent. Beer on point. Great price. Highly recommend. Nice day bar for happy hour. 

I wish I had more time to spend I will have to revisit very soon.I just had the honour of having Muncheez cater dessert crepes at My 40th birthday. WOW! They stole the show and my guests are still talking about it. Very fresh ingredients and impressive set up. 

Thank you for making my party one to remember. Can't wait to do it again.I went there during the "Montreal à table" festival.
Was extremely disappointed!!
I was told this is one of the best Greek restaurants in Montreal - especially for fish. What a joke !
I am very picky with fish and octopus (which I love perfectly cooked) : the octopus was burnt and hard, the halibut was overcooked
Very expensive also despite the festival special 
Will never go there again 
Much better places in Montreal for half the priceMy first impression is the long line of guests.
My second impression is the "imitation" crab soup.
That's all!!!
My first big disappointment is the Vietnamese beef stew with egg noodles. It was totally tasteless and sour, I felt like I was eating a Vietnamese beef Ragu dish without potatoes. Moreover, it was colorless. My friend gave up after tasting the soup.
The second big disappointment is the Pad Thai with shrimp and spicy level: hot. It was a big dish, but i thought they brought a dessert to me instead of an entree. It was very sweet, i tasted it without putting anything on it (siracha, soy sauce, hoisin sauce). In addition, there was no smell from the dish. And I gave up. Then, I asked for the checks and togo boxes, in order to remake it at home with hopes that i could make some changes to the beef stew.
At the end of the night, I still paid in full amount of my bill. However, I would like to ask the owner to rethink about the restaurant's award? Is it worthy?
Is the restaurant still living up on it?
I left the note on the table. Hope that they read it.In search of celebrating "National Cheeseburger Day", I found Johnny's Little Bar on a Cleveland list of recommended places to go in honor of this special day. My friend and I came in for lunch and each ordered whatever the regular burger was with fries. The burger was great and the meat was rich. The fries were ahmaaaazing too, very fresh and delicious.

The problem here: We nearly walked out after waiting around for 10 minutes just to be seated. There was no one else here except a couple dining at the bar. The girl working just stared at us, no greeting, no "I'll be with you in just a minute", no "we're closed right now", no nothing! We began thinking to ourselves maybe we are in the wrong place and started walking around and realized there was an upstairs. We went up and realized that it was closed up there. She didn't even bother telling us to not go up there. Seems like she really didn't give a crap about anything.

Anyway, I finally went up to the bar and asked if the kitchen was open. She says yes, sit wherever you'd like... why couldn't she just say that when we first came in? She only lasted the first 5 minutes of us ordering our drinks and food, it was then taken over by a gentleman who was so pleasant that he changed the entire experience for us.

This place would get four stars if it wasn't for that crappy service to begin with, and although I think the gentleman was great, I just don't think thats the way you treat anyone. 

Prices are fairly priced and food is tasteful, I may return depending on who I see working that day...Been twice so this is a review based on the combined impression both for brunch.
Coffee's excellent if a bit pricey (there's no drip option, which means better quality but if you are a serious coffee gulper that can add up) cocktails not bad at all, had the going to grandma's egg white earl grey based thing nice balance of sweet and sour. Beer limited taps (2) small collection of tall boys.
Mains, had the bread pudding plus bacon, loved the bacon, liked the pudding it was good but heavy which isn't all bad but it was very all the same bites for the whole plate. Needs something that gives it a chewy or crunchy bit. My friend had the all day breakfast, good potatoes ok egg, sausage was ample but a bit unusual in its spices without that being a good thing. Toast order wasn't quite right either. Special the second time was a korean pancake dish with the exellent bacon, kimchi, maple hosin sauce and a fried egg. Totally worth it compared to the other two dishes. 
Service is a bit spotty, however they are quite busy so it's hard to be sure if it's because they are busy or so busy chatting with each other. Overall I'd go back because it's a cute spot with the bacon to die for, however for the price I'd love to see the service come up a little notch. Points for putting in place a texting waiting system.This was a great place to stop for a quick bite. I sat at the counter and was greeted immediately.
I had the Mexican omelette which came with hashbrowns and two pancakes--so much food. 
Everything was hot and delicious. My waiter was very friendly as well. 
I'll definitely be backGreat Concept, Good Beer but there was nothing making want to go more than onceI have been so lazy for a year or so that I haven't made time to rate a good ol' 5 stars to any great experiences I've had out and about.  Hillstone moved me out of my lazy state and to the laptop for a moment. 

I have passed by about 100 times always wondering what was inside and finally ventured in on Saturday night.  

The place was absolutely amazing\/gorgeous\/well-designed from top to bottom.  Purely impressive.  

Service was spectacular.  It's nice to see a restaurant in AZ actually care about service, appearance of staff, and delivery.  Well executed. 

Food couldn't have been any more spot on.  I had the chance the have THE BEST ARTICHOKE i've ever had in my life as a "special" app of the night.  Wow!  
I also had the chance to try their Hawaiian Rib-Eye complete with a loaded baked potato and also their Thai Steak and Noodle Salad which was very tasty.  

Easy 5 stars.  Fantastic.Amen! Finally a great burger in North Phx. Outdoes 5 Guys by a mile! Love the choice of meat or salmon and the fries are perfect. Pretzel bun rocks! Thanks CMB for the great food and service.T'was our first time to ye old Shake Shack and a good experience we had!

I had ordered the Shroom Burger, understood that it was the vegetarian burger on the menu but did not realize that it was a huge (from what I could tell) portabella mushroom, breaded and that had acted as the "meat patty". I have to say that it has got to be the best veggie burger that I've had in town. The El Cortez Café used to have a BOMB.com veggie burger but they have removed it from the menu- BOO El Cortez, BOO!!!

The restaurant has modern décor, the staff is insanely friendly and from what i can tell, they keep the place pretty clean! They also have a ping pong table out front and while it's still not too hot outside (when the sun isn't out) you may find me out there. Just kidding, I don't play ping pong. 

The Gist: If I'm here, I'll order the Shroom Burger bc, YUM!!!From the moment we walked in the server was not happy. I ordered a few entrées the tikka masala was okay. The dal lentils tasted like dirty beans. Those are all things I wouldn't write a review for but What really pushed me away is when the server brought out sugar for my chai tea he didn't notice that the container for the sugar packets was full of ants which started to run out and on to the table. I waited around for the server to to check up on me. I was the only table there, but he didn't come back so I just walked out and will Never give them my business again.Maggino's in downtown Summerlin is always a great place for dinner and brunch on weekends. We have dined here before several times for dinner, always a great experience (hint - the restaurant has great specials that gives you your meal and a meal to take home) and the wait staff have told us about their brunch so today we decided to try it.

Menu - The menu had some great options for brunch with the restaurant  putting their spin on classics like chicken and waffles and unique dishes to include Maggiano's meatball. 

My wife ordered off of the restaurants dinner menu and ordered Chicken Marsala. What caught my eye was the 5 different versions of Eggs Benedict so I tried their crab cake Benedict. It was excellent, I was kind of optimistic with a fish and eggs, but honestly was very happily surprised. The holindase sauce combined with he crab cake meshed really well. 

As normal, the service is on point. The staff here is always very mellow, able to carry on a conversation while still taking care of their tables. At the time of our meal, the restaurant was about 70% occupied, however the staff is attentive so you never feel like you will wait for anything. 

I know the restaurant has the ability to host large parties and has a big separate area for special events. In conclusion, if your in Downtown Summerlin, I would highly recommend giving Maggiano's a try. Last hint, be prepared to take some home as portion are large for individual meals, there are also family style dining options.Pretty good.  I'm certainly not convinced it's more than your average Thai restaurant.  The service, menu, decor, ambiance etc were all fine.  The food didn't blow me away or even really make me happy.  I think it was the pot sticker starter that ruined my lunch.  Perhaps if I had been happy with them I would be at 4.  Maybe.  They tasted fishy and off.  I'm not even sure they were supposed to have fish in them.  I'd have to reread the menu.  Either way, I don't think I've left a pot sticker on a plate in my life!!! These were inedible.  Miriam ate a couple and said she didn't like them but then again she wasn't as repulsed as I was having eaten 2 of them.  

The red curry is ok.  I had it with duck.  The spice level is lower than most... fine by me.  The green beans and carrots in the dish were raw.  I'm used to tomatoes and pineapple with my duck but I don't care either way if it's prepared well.  I liked that you could substitute brown rice.  The curry didn't have that layered and complex dimension that I like in good curries.  It was a little thin but I did think it was ok.  Fine.Not my place I would order from again. Wanted to some pizza and wings to eat while watching the Cardinals game. I ordered online and not the easiest thing to do from your phone with the App. Went to their location to pick up our pizza and wings. Took a while for them to find out order and our wings want done didn't take too long for them to make her wings got home in the pizza look like this.I've never written a review before but Nando's was so bad that I had to!! Dry chicken, soggy fries, and the coleslaw tasted like I was eating straight mayo. Oh and the wrap was so bad!!! Ugh. Feeling sick. Don't order.So I Just had gluten free pizza for myself and my fam had reg pizza. Seriously so good. One thing all gluten free people know: gluten free pizza SUCKS. This destroys that idea completely. I would eat this as often as possible if I lived in the city (visiting). I had the El Diablo- obvi loved it. My fam had the Marg. and an El Diablo with regular crust and downed it all. Happy all around. Can't wait to come back. 
Other perk? The owners are AMAZING! I wanted to be friends with these people. So personable. So nice. So funny. Love them. They care so much about the food they're putting out, the customers, and the space. This place is awesome.The food is literally some of the worst food I've had in Arizona. My company had their Christmas party here last year and it was a disappointment all around even though it was free. 

In the future save yourself some time and grill your own steak and watch a western movie at home.went there for a birthday diner, we were here at the opening hour so had no problem to get a table. it is so beautiful, there is so much stuff to look at! it is a bit small tho.  it is a rhum bar so you better like rhum! the staff was amazing, excellent service! i only give 4 stars because of how small the menus is. i wished they had more and more! we tasted everything on it, and everything was good. i  wish i had someone at my house to cook me their plantains, so freaking gooooood!This place is conveniently located right next to the pool at Mandalay Bay. It has a pretty great lunch menu for a poolside grill. I only ordered the chicken caeser salad which was spot on for a light pool snack. 

If you're staying at the resort for a long period of time, I would recommend investing in the Souvenir cup for all your beverages. It costs a little more than a regular adult beverage, but you get twice as much drink and you get a discount for all follow on drinks. Like I said, only a good investment if you plan on having a good time by the pool of you know what I mean.I'm f*cked up enough right now to chow down on a wooden board and be happy. But no, I ordered Domino's instead and am now hoping that I can puke this up and search for a two by four.
Apparently this review is shorter than most, so I'll just add that the shity ass box is tastier than the shit turd crap inside. Go Domino's Pizza. I'm really not even disappointed!This place has become a Favorite of mine, from the bathrooms to the AWESOME service, to the overly delicious Food, Ling & Louie's is a Big Hit!

The Chicken Lettuce Wraps blow the pants off of  PF Chang's.  And during Happy Hour they are 5 bucks along with the Crispy Calamari which was the BEST tasting Calamari I've had anywhere! We also tried the tacos, Both the Firecracker Chicken and the Ahi Poke explode flavors all through your mouth leaving you wanting more and more. The tacos came with an Awesome tasting Fried Rice for a $1 more I believe, steamed rice white or brown are the other choices to go with your Tacos.

We washed it all down with the with a warm flavored Inkberry Shiraz Cabernet & a Great tasting Kona Brewing Co. "Big Wave" Golden Ale. Prices are Right on Time during Happy and I am a fan for life of this restaurant.

If you can get a seat in Amanda's area you will be treated King and Queen. She knows a lot about everything on the Menu and almost all the drinks. She and the rest of the staff seem to enjoy their jobs and walk around with lots of Smiles! Management came to check with us after our meal and I pretty much told him I be back and others will too!Love this place so close to home. You may have to wait 5-10 min. But it's so worth it.Apparently they don't stay open till nine anymore. I guess we'll be going to Capriotti's from now on.Too good for words!  Amazing service and even better food! I  can't wait to come back and try more! Charles was our server and did an excellent job recommending dishes! The chef came over a few times to check on us and even sent out food for us to try!Let me preface this review by saying that I love dive bars. I'm not talking about trendy hipster bars that aspire to be dive-esque, although those have their place and I'm not knocking them. But when I find that sweet spot of a total and absolute dive that I don't actually fear for my safety in, I am super-happy.

Walk into Armand's Bar anytime of day or night and it is full of cigarette smoke and regulars who are half in the bag. The drinks are absurdly cheap and the pour wondrously stiff. The people who drink there are friendly and when I've gone there with my husband we've been just left alone to drink and relax and when I've gone there with female friends old guys sometimes talk to us in a totally jovial\/friendly\/non-threatening way, but I've never had a problem just having my own space.

The bartenders are so sweet and as I said, very generous with their pours.

Seriously, I love Armand's Bar. First discovered it because I wanted to try the fish sandwich they brag about and it is DELICIOUS! I crave it every time I know I'm going back to da 'burgh. I seriously think this is the best fish sandwich in the city, and that is saying something in a place where many restaurants do a great fish sandwich.

So, this is five stars for a *dive bar* because if you want the *dive bar* experience, this is it, and it's awesome. Obviously this is not a place to go get a great Sazerac (er, or any Sazerac), and yes, the bathroom's kind of iffy, but if you just want a place that is totally chill and downtempo where you can drink with friends, it's a great spot.Went here with two other friends Friday night around 730pm. There was no wait and we sat ourselves. The drinks here are fabulous, the mules are delicious and so is there apple pear martini. Ordered the chicken Brie and couldn't have been more pleased. French fries were also done perfectly. I had a couple bites of the French dip as well and it melted in my mouth. This place is definitely a new favorite. We'll be back!What a gem! A co-worker of mine is a regular here and somewhat of a foodie, so my expectations of this place were already pretty high. First, may I say that this place is CLASSY . . . dim lights, pillars, red wines tastefully displayed throughout, and Franky playing in the background. I ordered something new to the menu . . squash gnocci's. They melted in my mouth. I will be back for their wine tasting for sure.This is my go-to place if I want great Filipino food, it's like grandma's cooking from back home. The employees are friendly and attentive and the food is relatively cheap and taste better compared to other Filipino restaurants in town. You should stop by, I recommend the Beef kare Kare because the meat is so TENDER and CRISPY TFC Fried Chicken.Like the new location but it's still too small for the number of customers. They should have kept the old place open in addition to opening this place. 30 min wait. Great food for great price though.We had a great time at Snakes & Lattes last week! It was my first time there and I was really impressed - lots of game options, a nice space, and good food. 

I had the veggie burger which was probably the best veg burger I've ever had. The side salad was decent but nothing special. Beers were $5, and there were lots of options. 

The table in the booth we sat at was huge - lots of room to play game and also have space for plates and glasses. 

One thing that bothered me was that we were charged a fee to play - I understand that's standard at this sort of establishment but since it wasn't communicated when we sat down (nor did it seem to be on any signs or written on the menu) I was very surprised to see a $6 charge on my bill. With 4 of us each charged $6 to play we're up to $24 - well on our way to just buying settlers of catan and being able to play at home.So delicious you don't even miss the meat.  Seriously.
The TVP is like a magical bizarro rendition of beef and the Yuba bean curd was tasty and filling.  The condiments are spot on, so make sure you spring for that guac and try some of the hot sauce.  Prices are decent for Vegan cuisine, and portions are really large - if you aren't super Hungry you might want to share. Sitting area is tiny, hot and somewhat awkward, so I would recommend getting take-out and eating in the park if it's nice.Awsome view of Bellagio water fountain, very kind hosts
Steak is very bad. Scallope is good.If you are a fan of Gordon Ramsay and fish and chips, I would highly recommend coming to this place and trying out his version of it. It's pretty classic, but I upgraded from regular fries to truffle fries which was worth it to me. The sauces were really good too. I had the sriracha aioli and tartar sauce. 

However, they don't have much seating available inside this restaurant, especially compared to the other restaurants inside the LINQ Promenade that offer a loooooot more seats.I was here when Anderson's first opened and waited 2 hours for loaded fries. I came here for dinner for the first time since then and only ordered boneless wings. The wings are burnt and dried and the chips were not even cooked all the way. This place needs to shape up. And it took 40 minutes for the burnt wings. SMH.Ok, so tradition says that after each child my wife and I have we break our 9mo sushi fast with a monstrous sushi binge unlike any other. This year Takara was the place. Here are my thoughts.

Sushi Quality: 
Superb. Everything was fresh and tasty. we didn't try everything but the spicy spider roll was outstanding. Also, the individually presented sushi was nicely done. The salmon tasted very good, and the tuna was outstanding.

Service:
The service was good. In general all of the staff was very nice and we never wanted for anything.

Ambience:
Others have commented on the ugliness of the strip mall this location is in, and they are right. BUT once inside it feels nice and comfortable and the atmosphere is sushi friendly.

Overall, an excellent re-introduction to sushi after a 9month hiatus.I have had the pleasure of dining at EVOO multiple times with great food and great service from a wonderful female server (her name escapes me, but she is excellent).  Because of those experiences and after raving to family and friends and bringing them to try the restaurant to try, I decided to have my birthday dinner there last night at 6 pm. 

I made a reservation early in previous week and was promptly told we have a two-hour limit.  OK..... cool.   That evening,  the express on the 401 had all lanes closed,  requiring us to take local traffic from Peel. Many of us arrived late.  I called the restaurant to let them know about the ETA and they said no problem.  When half of the guests arrived at 6:30, the server was very curt and said,  "I don't know who X is that made the reservation (not to me, but a guest),  but you guys have to be out of here by 8:15. You were told that when the reservation was made, soooo". Ummm,  happy birthday to me?  Very unprofessional. 

He gave us water and asked us if we wanted to order.  He did not tell us the specials and kept glancing at other servers as if we were a nuisance.  I then asked for the specials and he prattled them off quickly,  but only to me and not the whole table and promptly left, so there was no time to ask questions or for recommendations.  We kind of halfway heard what the specials were and stuck with the regular menu.   Upon his return, some of my guests asked for meal suggestions and what was popular and the server looked super annoyed and any dish inquired about was "good", barely engaging or making eye contact and snatching the menus quickly.  Every time he left the table, we noticed the chilliness and felt quite uncomfortable.   

The food came super quickly,  but tasted like it, and was definitely not what I was accustomed to in terms of flavour and quality. It was very disappointing (pool of water under my pasta, maybe not drained properly?).  When the rest of my guests arrived,  they were asked if they wanted drinks because there  wasn't enough time for them to eat and we have to be out by 8:15 and so,  they didn't. After hours in traffic....There was no happy birthday,  warmth, patience,  kindness, nothing. Just a hurry up and get out attitude throughout the evening.  The entire night was characterized by nervous glances and a sense of "please leave quickly". I've never felt so uncomfortable and unwelcome in a restaurant. Ever. It was a terrible feeling. 

Needless to say,  my birthday was ruined,  I couldn't order dessert and have my guests celebrate with me because I was rushed through my meal and reminded at least three times that I had to leave by 8:15 and in every way possible,  to hurry up.  My birthday was not acknowledged despite it being mentioned multiple times.  I am gravely dissapointed and hurt by my experience. I was treated like a nuisance the entire time and it soured my birthday evening and made things awkward. 

We were still hungry, insulted, and irritated,  so we went to another restaurant and continued the evening there,  with much better service.  We were actually able to relax,  makes jokes, chat,  and enjoy each other's company because we weren't being reminded to get out ASAP almost every time the server came by! I take full responsibility for arriving late,  but who could have forseen half of the highway shutting down?  If they could no longer accommodate my party of 6, they should have let us know when I called to let them know I would be arriving late.  Myself and my guests arrived with one hour and forty-five minutes left and were still treated like crap and an inconvenience. 

I will not be returning or recommending this restaurant to anyone ever again. If I could give them zero stars,  I would.  They weren't accommodating, friendly, professional, or polite, and made us feel very unwelcome.  Disappointed.I come here for lunch all the time! Clean, orderly authentic restaurant with a pleasant atmosphere. Lots of room for groups and the staff is always friendly. Price is a little higher compared to other fast food style Mexican restaurants in the area (about $10\/person for a full combo meal) but worth it. Carnitas is the best meat on the menu (al pastor and carne asada are sub-par)Was last night at the Gourmet Food & Wine Expo.  

After walking around -and a couple glasses of wine of course- I came to a complete stop when this amazing smell just hit me at once, I asked out-loud (directing the question to my boyfriend) WHERE... IS... THAT... SMELL... COMING... FROM ?  two or three people pointed at Royal Elephant's stand on my left.

It was their chicken satay skewers OMG!!!! that was the first bite of the night, what my taste buds where dreaming of since lunch time, what a lil teaser.  

Kept walking around and... WELL.... I tried nothing else except for some cheeses, I had to go back again and...... then again!.   That was my dinner, 3 of those amazing lil things... (I think I purchased the last 2 and now regret having shared one with my BF ;)) .... I refused to try anything else the whole evening *raises eyebrows and shoulders* I dunno!! these lil skewers got me good!

I didn't try any of their other dishes, but there was a lineup of anxious people waiting to be served and the stand was busy all 3 times that I came by.  I can only speak of their chicken satay and say .... BEST I've tried in TO, too bad they are not downtown or better yet just around the corner from my house! .... 

mmm .... maybe I can lure them into disclosing the secret recipe ;) 

Ohhh and the guy grilling them was super nice and the girl passing them wrapped in napkins just adorable! she must have found my addiction quite amusing!Yes! as a true foodie, traveler....and fan of Anthony Bourdain, I couldn't help but pass by this popular establishment on our last day in Montreal. Situated off the beaten path from the busy St Denis. We walk in around 10pm, no reservations (pun intended). Still got a seat. 

It's funny since we just came out of dinner (albeit bad one) an hour and half prior to our arrival. We felt the need anyways to spend some time here. Our order turned out to be light one. Sipped on some fine wine. Then settled for apps like  Cromesquis de foie gras (a little fois gras shot) 
and Saucissettes fumées marinées (little hot dog smoked sausage) with a side of their fries, made in duck fat. It all turned out pretty good. 

Peaking at the tables next to us, we witness the infamous duck in a can meat. Looked yummy. In fact, every single dish we saw looked good. Just wished we had a larger appetite. 

 Lovely modern simple decor. Service was friendly, laid-back but still very attentive. We even peaked at the main chef (forget his name) walking back in forth in his kitchen & talking some pics with fan. 

If ever in this area again, will be sure to hit this spot.Very happy and excited to have a nice Indian restaurant on the west side. Lunch specials and nice portions. Very clean and service was excellent. .. will bring the family next timevery bland food.. The fish and chips is a joke.  It's in a prime location, right next to the capital building of Madison, WI but look elsewhere for a great evening in Madison.Been to 3 Michelin 3-starred restaurants and this place is definitely up there. Must try in Toronto.Food was horrid.  I tried to scrape the fish and liver off the bagels.  Simply to salvage something from my 36 cad order.  But it must have sat for a bit as the flavours had seeped into bagels.    It was awful ... I'm not being dramatic when I say it made me. gag.   
Pickles and chips were good

Don't waste your money.  This food is so bad....  ack !!You definitely get your money's worth.  They had a three course special so my boyfriend an I both ordered the special.  The salads were huge.  The bread basket had three different varieties, I think ciabatta, pretzel, and a wafer looking one.  The bread and salads would have filled us up if we had eaten all of it. I had ordered lobster bisque in addition to my meal deal, it was just average.  
     My filet and crab cake was tasty, the sauce that was on top added flavor.  My boyfriend got the filet and shrimp scampi.  The shrimp scampi was the best I have had.  I'm not a dessert person but my boyfriend is, he got the creme brûlée, he said it was really good.  They packed up my key lime pie, we took it to the hotel, unfortunately we didn't eat it- so I can't say much about it other than it looked good!
     The bill was just under 100 dollars, which was less than we thought it would be.  The only bad thing about the place is the outside condition of the area, maybe that's just Cleveland!This is your neighbourhood greasy spoon diner. It gets busy on weekends so be prepared to wait. Excellent and personable service with a cozy and old school vibe. I had the gyro omlette which was tasty and had a unique flavour as it was served with tzaziki. Large portions, bottomless coffee as you would expect. A solid 4 stars from me and worth checking out over chains like eggsmart and cora's.Like the recent patio reservations, the tropical theme is a little weird for a place thats supposed to be a pub, but the rooftop view is nice. Now let's get to the 1 star. The music on the weekends at night. It doesn't make for a great atmosphere, the management seems completely out of touch with what people want. 

The second floor has music blasting, most often for an empty bar, and if you want to grab a beer with some friends and just chill (like one does at a pub) it makes it impossible. 

The rooftop is the place to be only because of the view, the DJ isn't very good and you often see what looks like the bar management really getting into it behind the DJ while most people don't share the same enthusiasm. 

I used to like this place but I try to avoid it these days. Plaza needs a good all around bar to go to, a place like Gin Mil in Southend where you can dance inside if you want to, chill with some friends either inside or go on the roof. What used to be a great go to rooftop bar has quickly become a place to avoid, try again later and regret.Enjoyed a fabulous lunch here recently.  I really like the vibes of this place as soon as I walked in.  The place isn't very big so be sure to make reservations.  I was really impressed with the service.  The waiters changed our plates and cutlery and cleaned off the table after we finished our appetizer and were very attentive in refilling our water.

My friend and I like to share so we ordered the Prix Fixe Lunch and the Grilled Cornish Hen.  The Prix Fixe lunch is a great deal that comes with one appetizer and a main for $22.  We selected the quinoa salad instead of the beet soup as starter and the braised beef as the main.  Really liked the flavouring in the Cornish hen dish.  Everything was delicious.

I heard the burger is a must try so I'll be back for sure to try it!I have been to Planta a bunch of times now and each and every single time, it has been superb. On this visit, we were there for my partner's brother's birthday. We had made reservations for 6PM and the place was busy by this point, with practically every table taken. Since this was a family dinner, one of the things I will note was that the restaurant (since busy) was loud. Usually I'm one for ambiance but this was almost too overpowering. I could barely hear anyone speak at my table, and I would like to think that I don't have hearing problems. 

Let's chat about everything else, shall we? Our server was on point, making sure we were taken care of and water glasses always full. She made sure to walk us through each and every single dish we had questions about and to tell us some of her own favourite dishes, which was super helpful for some of the family members who I was there with this time around. 

We shared two plates of cauliflower tots with the table, which were so delicious. Trust me, you want to order the cauliflower tots if you end up visiting here. They are deep-fried but they are light and crispy and wonderful. I ended up ordering the Planta Burger, which is one of their most popular items. I was sold when I read queso cheese and mushroom bacon.  The burger itself is a messy delight and literally does not taste like you're eating a vegan burger at all, which is just brilliant. But be forewarned, you will get messy eating this.  I swapped out my BBQ fries for truffle fries. They charge you a premium but it was the best life choice. 

Overall, Planta is a great restaurant. As a meat eater, I really enjoy it. But it's loud. Which kind of kills the vibe if you're trying to have a relaxing meal with family or friends.My family and I had a great meal!  The food is delicious and they have an extensive drink selection.  Fahad was an incredible server- very attentive and helpful!Ordered again today after an hour and 25 minutes still no sign of my food so I call in and he says it'll be another 10 minutes after calling his driver. I live 12 minutes away from this location. Will never order from here again.This is my new favorite place for lunch! Everyone in my office has been running out of ideas on where to eat lunch. We discovered this GEM 3 days ago and have been back everyday! The owner is one of the nicest people you well meet and is very thankful for everyones business.  They always get their orders right and everything is packaged and boxed perfectly. 

The Rueben and the Turkey Pepperoni wrap were both amazing.  Just put my order in for the Hot Italian Wrap today.

It's pretty safe to say, my whole company is hooked on this place.Came here with my family and ordered a bunch of dishes to share. 

We got: 
1) Seafood congee with fried cruller 
2) Fried turnip patties 
3) Singapore-style fried vermicelli 
4) Weekly special of ordinary sizzling beef stir-fry 

Everything was really great! Judging by the other reviews, the turnip patties are very much a must-order! They were so delicious - crunchy on the outside, flavoured so well, and smooth and soft on the inside. I'm dying to order them when I go back again!

The congee was also very good (of course) and the fried cruller was fresh. The vermicelli was better than your typical Chinese stir-fried noodles so I would definitely order it again as well.Chicken thighs were chopped up and served nicely in the container, but there was very little chicken. Most of it was chicken skin and it tasted terrible. I ordered through uber eats and am now going to find lunch cause the chicken was not edible.I order from here all the time. Doesn't disappoint. It's not the most delicious Chinese food I've had but it gets the job done when I have a craving.They DO NOT open at 9am on Mon-Fri. It is 10am!!! And prices here are rather pricey! And they do not have early bird special here.  

S : $3.10
M : $4.30
L : $5.30
XL : $6.30

They also have two other restaurants which they do open at 9am with the early bird special! 

The environment here pretty nice, elegant, and clean.

The food here are actually pretty good! I love the chern fun (steam rice noodle roll) the best. The steam rice noodle part was made fresh and smooth.Haven't been to this place in awhile due to horrible service. I decided to give the place a second chance. There are approximately 4 parties total in the restaurant. Coffee is cold, and my waitress took lunch right after taking our order. My parties food has been under a heating lamp for over 5 minutes. The staff does not seem to care much about customer service. I understand a waitress needs to eat, just not in front of their customers. . After finishing lunch our waitress brings our food. "The plates are extremely hot." Thanks heating lamp I appreciate it. After expressing concern for the time taken to cook the food our waitress replied with attitude. The manager came by and apologized for the miscommunication. The food tasted well. Over all not to bad of an experience.We love this place! The staff are very friendly and accommodating. The owner is super nice. Though we live in the far west valley, we'll be back!!!Food was good but pricy, usually 7-9  dollars for a dim sum, and 16-20 for an entree, and considering their portion, it is pricy. Average 40 per person. But the dim sum and noodles worth it.

However, the service needs to be improved. 1st time got soup on my pants while the waitress was trying to take the plates away without any notice while I'm working on another dish, got offered 20% discount fine. 2nd time was forced to buy more dim sum than we need, because they were literally threw dim sums on your table and let you to try them, while keep saying the dim sums were good!

4 stars for the food, 2 stars for the price, 0 for the service.The beef tataki was awesome. All of the sushi is very fresh. Service was consistently excellent. They offer orion beer and a couple of Japanese whiskeys. Very nice. A must try is garlic, pepper, tuna sashimi. Awesome!! For dessert the Korean ice cream sandwich is very good. For a off strip sushi place this place is a 10.EXPENSIVE - YES.  AWESOME - YES!

Bobby, you know Dinero, yeah - we've dined here.  Not together, but we like this place.  It is THE place!  A place to gawk at celebrities and the pretty people.  A place to get both delicious and fresh food, made to order, with accomodating & very attentive service.  They have an expansive wine selection, and offer two different dining area experiences.  The top floor, with several window-view tables overlooking the busy Avenue Road...is more traditional dining and tends to be quiet.  The downstairs area makes YOU feel like a celebrity.  Loud, intimate, all action, a romantic-setting, and GREAT!

I had the pleasure of dining here several times, and would love to go back again (and again) when visiting Toronto.  Love Sotto Sotto!I've been to Spotted Donkey many times and have always loved the delicious food and unique menu item choices. I was there today and as much as I enjoyed the meal I ordered, I was shocked and felt totally gouged by the $9 charge for the basket of chips brought to the table when we sat down. I don't think I've ever been to a Mexican restaurant where I was charged for the chips. Shame on the owners for that.Honestly, i expected what i'd heard to be one of the best brunches in town to be better. It was nothing to get stoked about. And it was not cheap. I have no problem shelling out good money for good food. At $11 for an entree, $4 for a side, and a few more bucks for orange juice+ a tip....it just doesn't seem worth it for a the breakfast i got. The grub was aiiiight. Nothing special that i couldn't have made at home. The service was also just aiiiight. We had to ask for the oh so popular butterscotch scones. Someone i was with mentioned that they used to just bring them out to each table but apparently not anymore. 
Wish i had more to say about everything but it was all just pretty blah. I should definitely be a little more excited about a meal that cost me twenty five bucks.I enjoyed the restaurant, atmosphere and food.  Really great first impression when you walk in, colorful space and a great spot in the Aria.  I think the tapas idea is great but it is definitely a spendy meal for not a lot of food.  It is the type of restaurant that you need to go grab a cheeseburger afterwards to really fee full.  Our favorite dishes were the scallops, spicy meatballs and the tenderloin over grilled bread.  I was a little disappointed with the steak tartare as it almost had a meatloaf consistency.  I'm a pretty traditional tartare eater though so I was missing the typical flavors and presentation.  

I'd try it again, it's a fun place for a big group.Yes! Finally, I got to take someone here. I do not know why but whenever anyone visits this is my go to suggestion AND yet people sometimes say no because of the wait. Let me tell you each and every minute I wait is worth it. My aunt and uncle were in town for the baseball game (btw we won) and I suggested we go here. We were already in the Strip District so they said ok. We walked in and they were just wide-eyed gaping at the menu not knowing what to try or where to even start. They kept on saying, wow it smell good. There was no wait, miracle!, and we got a table right in front. I got us each of the dips and sat waiting for our food to come and them to be amazed. 

Accompañamientos:
Maiz: Grilled Corn on the Cob: It was amazing as usual. I talked my aunt into getting one with me. She bit into it just saying, wow...that is good. It was sweet and grilled to perfection. Each time I get this corn there is nothing that I would add to it at all. My aunt added one of the sauces, or maybe a bit of all the sauces, to hers and really seemed to enjoy that mixture. 

Pequeños:
Provoletta: Sharp provolone grilled with arugula, lemon, and olives on toast.: I did not order this my aunt did for her main course. She said that it was almost too much cheese (if that is even a real complaint) but it was grilled to perfection. She also realized after this dish that she like arugula. It looked good. It was a nice thick slab of cheese on their toasted bread. i loved the look of it and would love to try it on another visit. 

Con pan:
Pescado:Fish of the day w\/ lettuces, lemon, and caramelized onion:  This is my jam. I get this all the time even though I always want to try new things. It is just so good. The onions are just perfection. Smokey and soft with the hint of the grill in them. The tilapia just grilled so that it flakes off in your mouth but stays together in the sandwich. The lettuce is abundant and so when things fall off the sandwich you also have a little side salad to go with it. The bread is just the best. Light and crusty....yummmmm. I would eat this everyday. 

Exclusivos:
Cerdo: Pork tenderloin, caramelized onion, and spicy mustard. Served with a small casa salad and tostado: At the last minute after much back and forth my uncle decided on the LARGE plate of the cerdo. It was a mountain of pork. He got it and when he looked at the plate just goes, maybe I should have gone with the small. He said the meat was great and the side of spicy mustard was just the right kick to make the plate amazing. He really loved it. 

I always enjoy showing and bringing people to some of my favorite places around the 'burg. I love it even more when the people love the places we get to try. I am so happy they had a great time and can not wait to go back.A little pricey, but the food was good as was the service. I've had tastier black & bleu burgers, but it was cooked to perfection, true medium rare like I like them. My husband's French dip was also excellent. I also commend them for not undercooking the asparagus spears. I would come here again in a heartbeat.This place is said to be haunted but we didn't run into any spirits.Looking for a brunch spot in Bloor West Village. Check out The Good Fork. They done did breakfast right.
Already been a couple of times and seems as though they have the system to get the eggs cooked right.. scrambled, the eggs are fluffy.. benedict, the eggs are poached right.. eggs over medium - they even know to cook just enough so that some yolk should ooze out after being cut. 

Servers do a good job keeping coffee topped up. 

OHHH..  Cholula hot sauce when you ask for hot sauce - that's already a WIN right there!-10 stars for them I live right around the corner from here and I refuse to shop there! When I do stop in to shop it drives me nut really I just want to scream at everyone working they are so rude and move everything around the lines are OMG the worst .. I drive all the way to the one on Arizona ave cuz it's sooo worth it. They now what customer service is and show it!!!Greasy spoons hurrah!!!

If you want a yummy grill style breakfast without the inflated prices of Golden Griddle and the shitty service you get there, Sunset Grill is a good one to add to your list.

As others have stated, this place is usually busy and for good reason so get there early or be prepared to wait for a table. If you're in the mood to meander and chat and have a two-hour breakfast, go to Cora's. This is the kind of place you come to when you have a hankering for pancakes, eggs, sausages, bacon and toast and you want it NOW.

I've rarely had bad service here but that's not to say service is fantastic either. But really who are we kidding? I come for the food!

I've had the grilled cheese, one of the breakfast plates, the tuna melt and pancakes over the years and none of them have disappointed. Other than that, there isnt much more to say! Simple food, done to order and it'll fill your belly up :)Super-consistent, delicious breakfast. Everything we've ordered has been fresh and yummy, and service is friendly and efficient. They do a big business in what they call a "German pancake" -- if you cook, you'll know it as a Dutch Baby -- but I judge any breakfast place by Eggs Benedict, and this place delivers.

Tip: in season and on weekends, arrive early (by 8 a.m.) because this place does a big business!This is as close as Wynn gets to an ice cream parlor. This place serves desserts and light snacks. It has a view of part of Wynn's water features. I've been here a few times, but so far haven't had anything except gelato. Coconut crunch varies from very good to excellent - very good coconut flavor, rich ice cream, and a pleasing crunch. Peanut butter ice cream is merely good - rich ice cream, but the peanut butter\/chocolate flavor is too sweet.

While the food is nothing to get excited about, it's a very pleasant place to stop and relax, especially if you can snag a table outside, right next to the waterfall.  Stare into the mist and forget you're in Las Vegas (ignore the minor distraction of a 3,000 room hotel in the background).This is my favorite restaurant. Especially, One of my most like food is chicken wings. Try this!!Three stars for now.  I'll update after a second visit.  My initial visit was on a Wednesday evening with my friend Michael.  A reunion of sorts.  We were greeted by Samantha.  She was extremely friendly and proud of the menu as she proceeded to share her recommendations and backstory of Toasted.

We learned that the majority of their sandwiches are toasted in the brick pizza oven.  I enjoyed the aroma of the bread toasting.

The lemonade wasn't overly sweet. Portions were sizable except for the cheese curds appetizer.

Highlights?

1) Fresh homemade ranch...buttermilk.  

2) The cucumber wasabi tasted like Tzatzki without the tart edge since it also had a buttermilk base.

3) Lightly seasoned fried chips with a perfect crisp.

4) Banana bread peanut butter whipped cream cheese bourbon caramel!  The bourbon flavor was very subtle.

5) Samantha came to our table and kindly answered my questions.  Service overall would rate 5 stars, at least for this visit.

My rasbrie sandwich was good, especially with the addition of green apple.  My friend's meal was a bit heavier just because his option had a fried pickle and fried cutlet.

Looking forward to another visit to update this review to a 4 or 5-star review.The biggest flaw of this place is the extremely slow wait times. There seems to be only one cook. I set my parking meter to an hour and twenty minutes and it was expired by the time I returned to my car. That meant that we waited around fifty minutes for our food. The staff is relatively amiable. However, I did catch them complaining about a customer who wanted her order done sooner. They talk about that customer as if she was in the wrong. Another problem are the extremely small tables. 

Its greatest strength are its really good prices. The breakfast special is $4.75 I believe for two eggs, two pancakes, and two sausages or bacon. It costs $6 if you want to include the misnamed American fries and coffee. Their "American" fries is actually very soft hash browns.Really enjoyed the food. They are located in the corner of a strip mall, this is really a hidden gem. Prices are great as well as food. Went on a week day and got my food quickly. Very fresh and tasty.  Will be a regular for me at lunch.This is our go to authentic Vietnamese restaurant. When we go here we know our experience will always be consistent. The service is lightning fast and the food comes out just as quickly. We can not  go here without ordering the Vietnamese egg rolls.Service, awesome.   Food, great.  Tried the special.   Great pizza.  Thin type crust, good sauce, and affordable for a large.  Parking is great.  Fast seating.  Just do it!My wife and I dined at Zeffirino on 09\/22\/15 with an 8:30 reservation.  We split a cold cut app and an orzo salad.  For dinner my wife had the Chilean sea bass and I the Pollo Fontina. Approximately an hour after eating, my wife began to feel ill. For the next twelve hours she was violently ill (vomiting\/severe diarrhea). So ill, that she unable to board her plane home. I spoke with the restuarant manager, Fabio Russo, and explained what had occurred. I explained that we incurred a $400 charge from the airline because we had to reschedule the flight due to the food poisoning. He not only refused to do anything but attempted to have me escorted out of the Restuarant by hotel security.   Don't risk getting sick! Go somewhere else. There are 30 other restaurants in the Venetian.First time Korean BBQ in Vegas and this place was good. Excellent service and lots of choices. Meat was really good. Some needed a little more flavor but just dipped it in there sauces. I would definitely go back.I wouldn't honestly go to this part of without my husband (lol) but I have had the carne asada, pastor, chicken and fish tacos here as well as a tostada and the horchata with pecan and cantaloupe so far and everything has been absolutely fresh and delicious and fantastic. We went to Chronic tacos a week later and their stuff was a salty tasteless disaster. Didn't even wanna finish it. Gonna stick with these guys from now on.My son lives in Tempe and we visited to see our new Grand-daughter. He took me here on Saturday June 17, 2018 mid-afternoon for an early "Fathers Day".  He brought me here because of the Sasquatch theme and we were happy about that. There weren't many customers, but we weren't seated immediately. The Manager\/Owner noticed and seated us and was very gracious. My son and his Mom had one of their specialty burgers and were very pleased. I noticed "Venison" chili by the soups because I don't often get the chance to taste venison. I was very disappointed. The overall taste was fine for regular chili with potatoes, beans, onions and cheese but the "meat" was sparse and only 1\/4 inch pieces here and there. I couldn't tell if it was beef, venison or ham since it was so small. I expected bite sized chunks like a Verde type item and the portion was barely over a cup not a bowl. This was a rip-off for $9.00. If we come back I won't be fooled again and will choose better.We found Tatsu by accident, because we were originally going to the shabu shabu place next to it but they weren't open yet. It was happy hour (3-6pm M-F) so we got some chicken karaage and gyoza for $3 instead of the usual $4.75\/order. Both things were good, with the chicken being flavorful and the gyoza nice and crispy on the edges. 

There are many options on the menu, including rice bowls. We ordered the deluxe ramen (egg, corn, bean sprouts, cabbage, seaweed, green onion, charsiu, thick noodles) and asked if we could get it with miso broth instead of the tonkotsu broth it usually comes with. Our waitress said yes, but neglected to mention that it was $1 extra. Not a big deal, but it would have been nice to know. The miso broth was okay but nothing to write home about. It tasted a bit watered down to me; I've had stronger, more flavorful miso broth from a packaged ramen from the Asian grocery.  What I did enjoy was the ample amount of vegetables that came with the ramen, as it made for a texturally interesting bowl. The charsiu was tender but oddly cold in the middle, as were the egg halves. 

In short, Tatsu is a solid ramen shop if you're in the area, and they have a decent happy hour.They have been making excellent hoagies and pizzas for decades. This place is beyond delicious and their service is always tip top. Do your self a favor and eat here!I love Sunset Station.  I used to live near here and would come here to see movies, dine out, and even gamble now and then.  There is also an arcade and bowling alley.  
I like that they have a little non smoking section with slots, although I wish it was larger and with more machines.Was in the area, looking for a place for a late lunch and stopped in.  Hard to see location in a strip mall.  Nice, clean interior.  Menu fairly large for lunch.  Salads were nice, generous portions.  Caprese salad especially good.  Pasta and sauce was OK, portions generous.  Service was friendly and attentive.  They need to lose the music, which would be something my parents would like, and I am in my 50's.  Overall OK, but not great experience.My wife and I have been eating here off and on for more than a year and we especially like the fish tacos with sweet mango topped. We are seniors and can only eat one each of the enormous tacos each. Because my wife is ill I came in alone today and tried to order one taco which I knew would be a challenge to finish. Not possible to order one taco they told me so I paid for two and almost finished one. Disappointed because the mango topping was rather hard and not sweet at all. I will be back one more time but not alone and give it one more try. Seniors beware huge tacos and no senior discount.Smoked catfish with Carolina BBQ, cole slaw, sweet potato fries and a Central Water Red Ale...delicious! The atmosphere was perfectly casual tooName does NOT match the restaurant.  "Rush Hour" sounds more fitting for a café, sandwich place, other takeout restaurant where you just pick up and go.  So when I arrived, I was surprised to find: 
1) FREE dedicated parking alongside the restaurant, 
2) a patio &, 
3) white table cloths with wine glasses on top.

I was going to ask the server about the name, but I forgot.  Plus, I didn't want to be rude since they were soo nice!  They even made me a port tonic - off menu, made sure it was the way I liked it, AND even changed it by adding the ice cubes...very important.

Complimentary bread (different kinds)\/hummus - Excellent!

Calamari - I wished it was a bit more grilled.  I know it can get rubbery when cooked more, but I love the grilled taste and that just wasn't that prominent.

The pastas were hidden in the "Hot off the pans" portion of the menu.  I just read through it and there was no pastas with a rosé\/tomato-based sauces.  I'm sure they could've accommodated this request, but you'll hafta consult your tastebuds as to whether or not those combos will taste well together.

My friend had the steak and it was cooked as per his request.  Fries were amazing, golden brown.  I hate when restaurants under\/overcook fries or they're limp\/greasy.

We were too stuffed for dessert, but the server brought us complimentary Natas.  Yum.  Will be back for either an occasion or a treat meal!Dolce Camerato - a sweet room or may refer to sweet music.  Since it's a cafe with sweets, let's go with the former.

I'm not that big on sweets so it only makes sense to go there for breakfast - I know, doesn't make sense but just go with me on this ... OK?  Thanks.

Since I no longer go to Pickle Barrel for breakfast in central Yonge and Steeles, I've been looking for a breakfast spot.  I would like to say that I found my spot but overall, it's A-OK at best.

We ordered a few items, a breakfast combo with eggs\/bacon\/sausage and toast, a western sandwich, and a latte.  Also added the coffee to each of the meal for another $1.

The coffee is your standard drip coffee from a me-too brand.  Weak and not worth going for a second cup.  The latte was better but nothing to rave about.

The breakfast was ok - the sausage needed a bit more time on the griddle.  The western sandwich could use a bit more something to keep it moist or maybe the omelette was a bit dry from over cooking.

Though it was not my kind of breakfast, it seemed to be OK with other diners as there was a steady flow of people.

For those who want to find this place, it's at the mall entrance that is sandwiched between the No Frills and Congee Queen.  Since it is at the Centrepoint Mall, there is plenty of parking.

During fairer weather, it might be a good place to hang out and people watch with a drink or a dessert as I spied a little patio.  Maybe I'll give it another go at another time.

Cheers.A gem in the Greek Danforth district. Pan deserves its consistent praises as it represents the best of Greektown, TO. Food and service are excellent, reminiscent of food you'd expect in the alleyways of Mykonos and Santorini!

On some evenings, Pan has a live belly dancer -- a lot of fun when you're dining with friends! 

Highly recommend the set menu -- unbeatable value and authentic food!Best Caffe in Town! Good food , perfect coffee and nice staff. Definitely will be back again.I was invited here for a Saturday birthday celebration brunch and it wasn't a bad experience.  It was my first time dining here as it has been on my dining list for awhile.  I ordered the Shrimp and Anson Mills grits which were delicious and I had a few glasses of Sangria as well (not bad at $2.50 for a nice sized glass).  The staff were super friendly and accommodating to our party of 11 and even adjusted everyone's bill due to the extended wait time for our food to be prepared.  I look forward to bringing my hubby here to dine next time and we'll probably go for lunch or dinner.Fired Pie locations seem to be popping up all over the place!  It was just a matter of time before one would appear in the University area.  Like other locations, this one offers a fast casual ambience, friendly service and a clean environment.  There are a handful of suggested toppings, but plenty to build your own.  How can you go wrong when it's exactly what you like?  They are only lacking free wifi.  Nevertheless, as Arnold said, "I'll be back"!Every time I agonize between the Vegetarian Mushroom Kimchi Reuben and the veggie poutine with feta. Both super extremely delicious - but unfortunately too large and filling to order both at once. So yeah, bring a friend.Delicious again...as always!!! Visited the restaurant for mothers day and it was wonderful! This time we had the Caesar and Chopped salads which were both amazing! We did the family portion which feeds 4 people. I had the chicken piccata which I loved! I'm really picky about my chicken piccatas. I prefer the chicken breast thinner ( i don't care for a fat chicken breast... You can't taste the wine butter seasoning). I usually ask restaurants to butterfly the breast for me. I didn't have to do that here that's the way they do it...Thank you :). My mom had the eggplant parmesan which was excellent....i might have to get that next time. My sister had the spinach lasagna which i didn't get to try because she ate it all but it looked amazing!!! We also ordered a side of Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes. Both were delicious and a must have when dining here. For dessert we had the lemon poppy seed donuts.  I wasn't sure if i was going to like it but the server recommended it. I'm glad he did....it was so good i couldn't stop eating it. I really love this restaurant they know Italian!!!Hands down the best local restaurant in Gilbert! The food was fresh, the service was great, and the food didn't take long at all once I ordered it. It is a great atmosphere and really cool how the farm is right behind the restaurant. It's not pricey at all and a great place to take the family, I would suggest going later at night around 7:30 or 8 because if you go earlier than that you will be waiting in line for a while!I say "no go to gro". The food was bland at best. The hummus had no taste and was a waste of calories. It PAINS me to say this...I'd go to Shomars before I go back to Gro. The staff is very friendly and helpful and it is new and unique in the way they have it laid out yet the uniqueness also makes it confusing. It is not worth the trip and I had a coupon. Still not worth the money. If you're going Greek, don't go Gro.Spacious, easy to hang in and awesome industrial feel. Beer was good. But they had tables and parties set up for reservations that were not going to be there for hours. I get wanting to be prepared but prepping for hours upon arrival?? Kinda inconsiderate towards the other customers.The inside is in serious need of reconfiguration and remodeling but the food is great. Locally owned which a a must for me it's BYOW but the corner mart in the same plaza has a large selection of wines.My first meal here was just okay, but every subsequent dinner has been excellent. The vibe and decor are elegant but subdued, and the service matches. Most importantly, the food is excellent and inventive without being overwhelmingly out there. The bone marrow appetizer is a must. My only wish would be that I could enjoy Cleveland's most regarded restauranteur more regularly like I did when Lolita was also around!I was on my way out of the Phoenix area when I needed some food. I stopped at this Coco's in Sun City excepting average. This was better than average. The service was very good and fast. The menu selection was great. It seems like there were too much to choose from. I couldn't decide. A great place to stop if you want to get something delicious but you need to get on the road quickly.Love love Korean Mexican fusion!  Bulgogi fries, kimchi fried rice, pork belly tacos and nachos were so delicious!  A must try and once you try it, you'll be hooked!  Amazing flavors, mixture of korean meat and mexican dish combined!This funky little eatery in the South End has grown quite a bit (not in size, but in appeal) over the last few years.  What started as not much more than a rather ugly yellow cinder block building on an oddly-shaped lot is now that and more - they've added some landscaping, a paved lot instead of the gravel parking and a nice outdoor eating area too.  Inside the food is the same great, simple combinations you're used to getting.

The cramped quarters also haven't changed much, but that's just part of the appeal.  As strange as it may sound, the sheer volume that moves through this place makes it possible to place your order and get a table by the time the order is ready - provided everyone cooperates and doesn't hog their table out of their place in line.  When you're done, get up and let someone else have the table, and everything keeps moving as it should.

Table tops still contain business cards from around town, and there is plenty of artwork to see as well, and the atmosphere is worth coming for, but it's the food that should keep you coming back.  While the burrito is the namesake of the place, make sure you try the quesadilla too.  They are excellent.For what it is, this place is ok....though we do also refer to it as "Denny's" I mean...Denny's is ok too right? The mussels in white sauce are way better than the andouie ones which oddly came recommended by the wait staff. This place reminds me most of a restaurant one might find in an airport. In offensive, fine and filled with business casual travelers.I took my wife here for her 30th birthday.  The views as everyone else has stated are WELL worth the visit.  We arrived in mid January for a 6pm reservation and the sun had just set, leaving a breathtaking view of the surrounding mountains.  The colors in the sky were captured perfectly in the floor to ceiling glass that fronts the entire restaurant.  

Service was great but the food was merely good...not great.  I had the lamb and my wife had the fillet.  I would say hers was better than mine but neither were out of this world.  Especially considering the price.

That said, it is a must visit in the Valley for the views and ambiance alone.While I have been a fan for LGO for years now, Cole and his pastry team have made me a true LGO fan for life. I first met Cole when working with him to create 2 custom cakes for my wedding last year, which turned out so great, and still edible and tasty after freezing a slice for a year. Then we found out that we were expecting a little one and who else could we turn to, to make us a gender reveal cake, but Cole again! We gave him free reign for flavor, décor, etc. and I have to say that his vanilla bean coconut cream cheese toasted pecan cake was one of the best cakes I have ever tasted, not to mention special because it held the secret to our baby's gender (not to mention the 6 hour turn around time). Cannot wait to celebrate many more milestones with LGO and company. Cheers!I've been to this establishment twice. First time service was horrible and I figured it was just an off day and I typically give restaurants many chances. Took my family today and I am now convinced to never step foot in here again. My family of 5 was seated and we witnessed 2 other families walk in about 10 mins after us and placed order. It seemed one of the family knew the worker because they were pretty excited to see each other. About 15 mins passed and the other two parties received their food. The worker refilled their drinks multiple times and not once had she offered to fill ours. As I said before I am one to normally give restaurants multiple chances hoping it was just an off day but the service sucks. Food is okay. They have good meals except their fried rice is always pretty dry.2 thumbs up!!!!  Highly recommend this restaurant!  Great service and excellent food!  Place is small and quaint and it gets very packed but worth the wait!  Menu was in French and I can't read or speak French but waitress translated each item on the menu (even though the place was super busy)!  They're juices are made fresh...I had the grapefruit juice...super delightful!  I had 2 egg breakfast came with bacon, potatoes and toast...everything was delicious!  I will definitely come back!Good ribs for the price. Was very busy so service was a little slow. Deserts were nice. 
Oddly a large percentage of clientele were the older crowd, 50+.If youre one of those people like me that is used to have good Mexican food like the one in all San Diego Ca, don't bother coming here.  Carne asada fries, the AZ burrito and Fajitas plate,  is what I ordered. I almost cried. Savorless, pricey, and the portions were so little, on top of that, they charge you .75 cents for using CC or debit card. I found the place through yelp. I believe this place is overrated. In the outside has a huge advertising that says that the place is rated #1 in all AZ.  Hard to believe, because my experience today was like having ramen maruchan at homeThere are few times I have been so rarely disappointed in a restaurant.


The Manti was poorly executed. At a $17 price point it needs to be perfect. 
Thick dough, scarcely a wisp of ground lamb, topped with a watery, limp yogurt sauce that was deficient in spice and aromatics. 
The previous incarnation's (Anatalion Turkish Cuisine's) was much, much better.

The bread they brought out at the start had been made the day before. Perhaps even leftovers from the day before, that were hastily microwaved, and glazed with olive oil to give the appearance of fresh baked. Though it was far from fresh. 

The grilled meat platter was suspect. A small ramekin of rice was served. Plain white, Uncle Ben's rice mind you, and a second ramekin cost me $5. 
Literally a dollop of boiled white rice with a sprinkle of parsley for $5. 
That is tantamount to highway robbery in this particular restaurant Plaza.  
I felt violated. Almost to the point of calling 911 and saying I've just been robbed.

Lastly. $1.50 for Turkish tea is insulting. This is the only place I know who charges for it.

The ambience and layout is nice. It's a beautiful place. 
But it's only a matter of time until Pasha dies and goes to Restaurant Heaven.
The Downtown prices do not fit the East York Thornecliffe location. 
The service and product should befit the price, this is

If you're craving Turkish. Head elsewhere. Shirin, Pizza Pide, Mr Pide and Kebab 49 are all much, much better.It was our first time visiting, but I'll definitely be interested in returning! The Pumpkin Peanut Curry had amazing flavor. The restaurant was clean and pleasant, and the wait staff helpful.They told us we couldn't get in bc we were intoxicated... I respect bouncers and bartenders but this was out of line. He denied everyone that was in line since 1:05am. I had a glass of wine and he asked what we did tonight and I told him we went to a wedding so we are celebrating... it was st Patrick's Day so I get it. But I wasn't drunk not even close. Too happy? Ok I just witnessed two people getting married!?!?! Yes I'm happy. 

Whatever we went to another bar without making a scene. Bartender was amazing. He was surprised this guy didn't let us in. Won't recommend or come here ever.Have never been disappointed with anything I have ordered. 

Only place worth its Dollars since New York Wok sold to new management that cannot cook there way out of a bag in a fryerStandard Japanese hibachi restaurant. Our tableside chef had a good personality and catered to the bride-to-be at our rehearsal dinner.

Food was good not great, prices were fair.Great for what it is. An old school diner. Had a hamburger and fries. Only complaint would be to change out the bun. It doesn't hold up and breaks apart as you are eating. My dinner companion had a hotdog and fries and had the same issue with his bun.Great place! Excellent prime rib. The staff and owners are very friendly and service is great. I love this place and go there frequently. It's a little neighborhood gem.The bartender Sierra and server Cage are the combo to have. The wife and I sat down for a Sunday dinner and unfortunately the steak the wife ordered came out over done... Sierra and Cage took care of it. Cage insisted that it was cooked to order. It was a great experience having such great customer service and the wife and I will be traveling back to that specific outback because of them two.Listen, I always go here and love it, and I go to trivia all the time, but at tonight's trivia you guys had an incorrect answer which rubbed me the wrong way. Ulysses S. Grant has a beard, not sure which of you thought otherwise, but they are wrong, and the whole bar shouldn't have gotten punished for their stupidity. Please use correct answers, or at least void the question, and then I'll give you the 5 stars you otherwise deserveExcellent! Food and service were top notch! My daughters had the Nutella French toast and crepes-so delicious.Tried the cranberry salad today! It was amazing! Dressing was so good! Also had the wedding cookies and I could  eat them all day!I really wanted to like this place!  My husband and I checked this place out for dinner the other night.  We both got one of the combos.  We were immediately impressed by the prices and the amount of food you get.  However, when we got our food, we were VERY disappointed.  The sushi rolls fell apart and the fish did not taste fresh at all.  I got the fried rice with my combo and it was probably the worst fried rice I have ever eaten.  It tasted very stale and reminded me of play doh. (No I don't eat play doh... but I'm sure you get what I mean.) We were very shocked because of the awesome reviews.  I did noticed that a lot of the people had ordered hibachi and not many people sitting around us had ordered the sushi... maybe Yoshi's is better at hibachi food?I had to live in the Holiday Inn over Thanksgiving. The rooms are average. Clean, boring and nothing exciting. You're going to pay more than a regular Holiday Inn because of the proxmity to Pitt and Carnegie Mellon. If somebody wants to make a lot of money easily, open up a nice Bed and Breakfast in Oakland. you'll make a fortune inside of ten years. But I digress...

 One of the elevators broke which was not kosher. However, other than that one annoying factor, I will say that the staff here is great. Anything I needed, I got within minutes of asking. Coffee filters. Extra washcloths. etc. 

I was in a wedding party and we were going to walk to Heinz Chapel for the ceremony.. The front desk girls insisted that the shuttle guy would drive us and we were not walking that far in heels or getting our hair windblown. The shuttle driver helped each girl in and out of the van, not because he was creepy but he was truly a nice man.  Apparently we were the third wedding of the day he ferried over to Heinz Chapel.High class subway maybe? The bread was amazing. The ordering process was a little more confusing. I wasn't exactly sure where to stand being that it was my first time there. Was it like a chipotle and I work my way down the line? I couldn't tell... and the employees didn't really lead the way. One shouted a few questions while she made my godfather sub from the center of the line- I couldn't see what she was doing or putting on it. (I prefer the clear glass of subway) As she is still making it another employee who obviously is bored and wants something to do directs me to the cash register and starts asking me what I ordered? Was it hot or cold? And if I wanted anything else with it. Felt like a test LOL. Proceeded to check me out while she was still making my sub. As soon as I was in the restaurant I was out of the restaurant and the place was empty again. I got home to try my sub and it was almost as much meat as bread and very skimpy on the veggies. Next time I will have to be specific about how I want it. Way too much meat. Definitely a manly man sub. Not a bad lunch on the go if your specific.Wow, really poor lunch spot. No one was manning the front counter, it took about 10 minutes for a taco and burrito. Only a few tables were dirty, but it felt worse that the employee on break in uniform and apron couldn't do anything because they looked short handed. I have seen better Taco Bell locations in my days.This is by far one of my favorite restaurants in Tempe! The service is great, always friendly, and the pho is fantastic!This is my most frequented Pizza Nova location, and my fave pizza chain. I come here about a few times a month, usually for a slice, but sometimes for a pizza. Delivery is always fast. If I order for pick-up, my order is always ready in the time specified. Pizza is consistently good. I am in love with the wings here. Service is good as well.Visited this location as it is conveniently located inside Square One. 

The purpose of the visit was just to get the buffalo chicken fries. The fries took a couple minutes to serve.  Even after the wait the chicken fries were not fresh. It was old, stale and lukewarm. It was not crispy at all and tasted soggy. So disappointed. The chicken fries were so good at the other location.  

Sigh. They serve old food.  

Next time ask for "fresh chicken fries". This will allow you to get hot and freshly cooked chicken fries....We've patronized SM's for brunch on numerous occasions and the one consistency is the poor customer service.  Sometimes I'm brought water, sometimes I'm led to believe I have to request it.  the toast is never served with jelly or jam, nor is it on the table.  I have to ask for it every time and by the time someone comes back with it, my food is cold.  Missing silverware is commonplace and usually we have to ask for it several times before it's brought to us.  I have never once been asked if I would like a refill or warm up for my cold coffee.  Last visit the fruit was given to us at the end of our meal (we were told they were waiting for them to be assembled by the kitchen) however people who were seated after us had been served theirs.  Last visit, a couple in back of us pushed ahead and seated themselves at the last available large table up by the bar.  My thoughts are that they know the routine and didn't want to sit at a small side table in close proximity to other diners.  While they spread out, our family of five had to squeeze around a table meant for four.  The hostess and staff were completely oblivious.  The waitress\/waiter should have noticed they didn't have menus and reseated them at a smaller table.  It really irked me that they were enjoying coffee before we were even seated and they were behind us in line.  While I would give the food 4 stars, everything else is sadly lacking.  I'm always made to feel like I'm a burden for asking for the simplest thing, which  is usually forgotten right after I ask for it.  SM's in my opinion is missing a strong manager.  Someone to pour coffee, circulate, and pay attention to details, like missing silverware and the obvious searching looks of customers trying to find missing wait staff.When the crawfish and blue crabs are fresh...they are the most delectable, mouth-watering, delicious dish in the world (wow...it makes me salivate just thinking about it)! If you love crawfish! This is the place! The Hot N Juicy seasoning (the mix of everything) is the best I've ever tasted. I'm a chicken, so I stick to mild...

But I didn't give them 5 stars because if the CRAWFISH ARE FROZEN...STAY AWAY! The waitress did warn us...and they were $6.99\/lb but my sister was in town for Thanksgiving, and I raved to her about this place. EEEE GADS! We got 5 lbs and they WERE MUSHY! I think my sister complained of a belly ache afterwards. Not me, I have a strong stomach for crawfish...ha ha...

We did get a couple pounds of the fresh blue crabs and they were heavenly and the meat sweet and tender!

Also, be prepared...IT's MESSY! Make sure you wear a bib. Thank goodness there are plenty of paper towels...I think I used up a whole roll...

I highly recommend this place, as long as the crawfish and seafood are fresh! I think between July - September, they are the biggest!!! I'm sure I will be back there in January when they are in season (small...? Who cares...it's still CRAWFISH)!Went in as soon as they opened and asked for the LG pizza and 20 wing special. They told me right away that it will take 40 minutes because they had to start the oven. Which pizzeria starts the oven at the time of opening? I sat down and waited. After 20 minutes my pizza was out but only the pizza and no wings. I was told with an attitude that I didn't order the special. I clearly ordered the special when I walked in. Than I realized that they obviously didn't like me ordering the special as soon as they opened. Rather than trying to rectify the issue they were arguing with me and showed attitudes. The pizza and the wings weren't all that good either. I am from New York, there are better NY pizzas in the west valley. Never going back againStopped by this place for lunch before my flight. I really wanted some breakfast food but did not realize they stop serving breakfast after 10:00 AM. But...I thought all diners serves breakfast all day. But regardless the point, all of us ordered burgers and it was just whatever. There was nothing great about the expensive burgers nor the milkshake. I looked up the menu on the web while my friends waited in line...but all the stuff I picked out off the menu listed on the website, they didn't have it. which was really odd. I guess I cannot complain since the food choices are limited at the airport.Can't go wrong here! This is one of the hot spots in LV. It's right in the middle of an upscale mall and has a nice buzz  to their energy level. The food is really on point but know ahead of time, everything is a la carte. I ordered the filet mignon which was prepared medium-rare. It was pink in the center, tender, tasty and really filling. Our group ordered an individual plate and then we shared the sides we ordered. No quality was spared by the chefs and we indulged like kings! 

It's on the higher end of the price range but it will make your trip to Las Vegas memorable and delightful.Great food! The space is a little small considering the crowd, but the waiters still provided good service. O had the Szechuan beef noodle soup and it was amazing! The beef was very tender and the soup was flavorful! Will definitely go back!Came here on Valentine's Day. The service was phenomenal and the food was perfect!  Best oysters and best grits I've had.Good service, nice people, comfortable atmosphere. Lemon chicken rice soup was good. Chef's Greek salad was generous and I was impressed by the quality of the mixed greens. I would happily order this again. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was the pita. I got what I assume to be one very small pita cut into quarters with my soup and my salad. It wasn't bad. It was serviceable but had no personality or love in it at all - exactly like it was delivered in a plastic bag from a factory. If I make the assumption that Pitta is the same as pita, then I would expect the restaurant namesake item to be more remarkable. Go here for the food but certainly not the pita.

You can do better than this, guys.A true Irish Pub - you just might meet Rosie herself. Great ambience - like being in Ireland. Fish & chips are perfect - like being in Ireland. Irish stew is great - like being in Ireland. And the Guinness - not quite like Ireland, but it's as close as you get in the U.S. (nothing tops the Guinness you get in Ireland!!) Limited wine selection which was a disappointment for those of us who are not beer drinkers (I know, I know - Irish pubs aren't supposed to be known by their selection of fine wine!) Something on the menu for everyone; live music on the weekend.As far as bars go, I think this is my favourite one yet.
A friend was showing us around Montreal and had this bad boy up his sleeve as a 'surprise'.
When we got to the black door with graffiti (may have been formerly red), I thought he was pulling my leg. I had ants in my pants walking down the short hallway and was amazed when he pulled back the curtain!

This is the most chic bar I've ever been to. Use it to impress the girl you like... or even her mother! This place isn't what it seems and stuns the eye when you enter.
I love the candles lining the table tops. The whiskey hanging from the ceiling is a nice touch. Also, take a peak at the back if you can cause you might be able to see the server shaking up your drinks - it's quite cool.
Their drink menu is good. As a person who doesn't drink I appreciated the non-alcohol menu. The pricing was apt because you're mostly paying for the atmosphere.Pretty straight forward place. Regular sandwich and chips, no frills. Inside is pretty sub par but clean. I got a roast beef, turkey and cheese with chips and a drink for under $10. I would go here again because it was a fine sandwich but don't expect any kind of goat cheese, special sauces, or homemade chips.Chicken Spiedini is great! Chicken Parmagiana was fair!Antipasti was good! Service is good.We just left this new place and it was our first time. Plates are very small for the price. The server with the nose ring didn't know her menus more drink menus and worse she didn't know what alcohol that was stocked. I ordered a Don Julio Margarita and I get the check and she charged me $38 for some Don Julio 1942 that I didn't order. Why would I want a premium tequila in a margarita. I ordered a simple Don Julio margarita. Terrible way to conduct business. We won't be back until they step it up.The presentation of this place is very nice.  I was instantly drawn to it as I walked by.  Inside it's more like seat yourself, which is fine.  High tables, lot of people don't like that but I was fine with it.  Decor and ambiance is fitting to the theme of the place.  Drink menu was very extensive, I'm a scotch guy, mixed drinks are not really my thing but when in Rome, why not.  I had the flaming Manhattan immediately and the presentation was just right, because I like smokey scotch I figured I would like a smokey bourbon - was a treat to watch the prep.  After a while I was notified by my server, who was always available, that my food would be a bit late.  Without drawing this review out, I just want to say, it was no one's fault specifically to the delay and I didn't take any offence.  The manager came and apologized, I said it was ok.  Not only did the food come out shortly after and it was delicious, the staff there felt very bad about the delay and they made sure I left happy by taking care of me however they could.  Truth be told even if the food was terrible, I'd still give this place a 5 just because of how they treated me.  I appreciated it greatly. Thank you Thiago, you are an utmost professional and you will go a long way with you're demeanor.  I will be back for sure!This location is better than some as the line seem to move relatively quickly. I also enjoy adding any sized coffee for 99 cents if you buy a breakfast sandwich. I like stopping in on my way to work for a skinny bagel with avocado and egg whites. It's not to bad, and can sometimes be tasty.

That being said, the food is way overpriced for the quality. The create your own salad at lunchtime option is nice, but for $7.99, it would be nice to have fresh lettuce. The roast beef sandwich with herbed cheese is another go to, and I have never been let down by this sandwich. However, it really is overpriced.

The soup selection is good, however, if you're in the mood for mac and cheese, get there early because it usually runs out at about 12:30.This place has a really nice concept, kind of like a subway-style way of ordering but with pizza. The pizzas are pretty good and are served up fast. One pizza is a suitable meal for one if you're super hungry or have a big appetite, if you're not quite as hungry you may end up with. leftover slice or two. One thing to note is the pizza really doesn't keep well. Normally I love leftover pizza but they don't put a lot of sauce on and the crust is very thin so leftovers are pretty dry. The salads here are pretty good too.Great surprise in a great hidden location. I had one of the burgers which was great. Sweet potato fries were some of the best I've ever had. Honestly I was surprised the meals are predominately under $10 .... the quality is much better than prices. The restaurant reminds me of a nicer MTO cafe with better prices... Or much better food than Rachel's with similar process. The kicker is the full service bar!  And the patio is great for outdoor dining.A must afternoon stop for happy hour ---- Alex and Danny's smile charm and service are just what we need before heading into an evening of gambling ;)I come here for dinner pretty often and I don't know why. It's pretty expensive, the service is terrible (enjoy being handed a menu and told to seat yourself) and the vegetable dumplings often taste weird and ain't that hot texture wise either. 

But I keep coming back because I love having steaming boiled dumplings after a really long work day. Reminds me of home. It's just nice. It's a very casual setting and if you like fried dumplings, those looked very good when other people got them.We went here for a sorority brunch. The location is beautiful and the restaurant seems nice. I can't wait to come back and try it on my own. The brunch was more like a continental breakfast so I don't think it was representative of the restaurant.  I'm giving it 5 stars because I love the view. We went for a boat ride afterwards around the lake which was $5 per person and worth it if you like boat rides (I do!). Come check it out. I'll be back!We came here for dinner on a Friday night and the experience was amazing.  

The ambiance was chic, cozy and friendly.  The staff were attentive and helpful.  

The food was incredible.  From locally sourced ingredients to the hand made pasta , each meal was amazing.  The cocktails were also excellent.  

Location is perfect.  In Old Scottsdale Across the street from a Jazz bar.My husband and I come here at least once a week and tonight they completely messed everything up. We got here at 7pm, waited to be seated and we got seated at 7:30pm. We ordered food and we waited till 8:45 and no food came. All we got was our drinks and chips. I had to ask for the soup because they didn't even bring it to us. So I ask the waiter about where our food was.. He said their thermal printer ran out of paper so they put a new roll in and our food will be out in 5 mins. We couldn't wait any longer because our friend had to go to work. My question is that if the printer was out of paper then why did everyone around us that got there after Us got their food? 
If the waiter would've just kept up and realized we haven't gotten our food in 20-30 mins he should've known something was wrong. The problem is, they messed up.. And now they will lose a good customer. Like I said, my husband and I eat there at least once a week. Looks like we will be taking our business elsewhere . We got up and left, after waiting for over an hour for our food. I told the manager and he acted like he didn't even know anything and didn't care. The waiter should've told the manager what happened and the manager could've at least came to our table and apologize. We got nothing.

If I could give this place negative 100 stars right now I could. Not only we left with empty starving stomachs but we also left feeling like this place didn't give two sh*ts about customer service.Pros:
Very good bowl of wonton noodles

Cons:
Prices a bit higher than Jim Chai Kee

Let's get this out of the way, Jim Chai Kee is the my favourite place to get a bowl of wonton noodle.  That being said, this place is a very good second.  It's easily the best in Markham.  

This Wonton Chai location is located in the Langham shopping plaza.  It's definitely smaller than the other Wonton Chai location in Scarborough.  During peak times, this place will get very busy so expect to wait for a table.  Turnover at these types of places are very fast so it won't be long.  It will be even quicker if you don't mind sharing a large table with other patrons.  I would say 6 people if the maximum group size for a comfortable experience.

If you've been to one of these places, you know the wonton noodle is the feature dish.  There are other noodles like brisket, dace and beef as well, but you're most likely coming for the wontons.  This place doesn't disappoint with their rendition of it.  The wontons are large and full of shrimp.  Their a little saltier than Jim Chai Kee, but still very good. My GF ordered the wonton noodle and I got the same with brisket as well.  The brisket was a little tough, but overall it was enjoyable.  

The prices here are higher here.  I think it's about a $1 difference per bowl over Jim Chai Kee.  It's not a complete deal breaker but it is something to note.  Service here is on par with most places of this nature.  Nothing of note to mention when it comes to that.

If you're in Markham, this is your go to place for wonton noodles. I have not found a better place.  Jim Chai Kee remains my favourite, but you can't go wrong here as well.Horrible experience all around. Placed a take out order and it was told to be a 10 to 15 minute wait. I arrived to a nearly empty restaurant on a Friday night that had an overwhelming smell of burnt oil. I should have turned around and left right there. Also, I arrived 20 minutes after my initial call was placed, expecting my food to be ready when I got there. They obviously didn't start cooking until they receive payment for their order. I received my food  45 minutes after the order was placed. When asked if this was normal, the reply was that the kitchen was very busy. There were three tables there with people, and no one at the hibachi bar. I was the only take out order the entire time I was there. Don't even get me started on how bad the food was once I got it home. Never again!Great, fresh sushi. Nice staff, quick service.The pizza and staff are great. Old place, more of a 'dive' feel. But the pizza is amazingCharleston's is one of my favorite restaurants! My friends and I meet there frequently simply because we love the food and the service is always excellent. We equally enjoy the atmosphere. We usually sit in the bar area and appreciate the calm and quiet setting. It is pleasant whether we are sitting inside or out on the patio. We are able to visit with one another and enjoy the fabulous food from Charleston's. We love it there.Been eating at Lupies for over 20 years. Food is always consistently good! It's a neat dive. Their Texas chili is awesome and always perfect for a burger or nachos. The chili slaw burger or nachos are the best. Sweet tea is always perfectly sweetened.Way overpriced.  I've had some of the best Middle Eastern food having spent time in Saudi Arabia, Jordan, UAE and many other countries in the region.  I have never been to Iran, would love to, so I can't say that I'm an expert in Persian food.....however, I have eaten at Persian restaurants in NYC that have floored me with their flavors and interesting recipes.  It also may have been what I ordered since it was roasted chicken with a mild flavor.  However, if you like the typical assortment of shish kabobs, I'm sure you might be satisfied.  I tend to draw more toward "stuffed" anythings....casseroles and stews so maybe I'm not being fair because I didn't see much of a selection on the menu.  But I probably won't go back again just because I thought it was way overpriced for what you get.So we walked into this place around 6pm.. it was SO hot and humid in there it was barely tolerable. After we were sat this baby started screaming and puking all over the mother, the table, itself.. was pretty disgusting. After getting over that the waitress brought over menu and chips and salsa. Took one bite of the salsa, that was it.. out of here. The salsa here is from a can.. tasted like tin with some added cumin. The chips were cold, greasy, stale and soggy form the humidity. Threw a buck in the table and walked out. 

Perhaps its better in the winter time sans the swamp coolers and the puking baby?Poor service over priced food. Bartender didn't look at us the entire time we were there.  He didn't present the happy hour menu so we paid full price for our drinks.  We were empty even though we like to have our drinks.  The food ok not great, fine, but a real lack of service.I was a little apprehensive to try Pomelo based on the bad service reviews, but our experience was far from bad and maybe they have hit their stride now.  The service from hostess station to the table staff was prompt and friendly and our water glasses and drinks were always filled, and it truly seemed like this level of service was going on at every table around us. They were steady but not packed and it was lunch time. 

I had the patty melt, which was huge, super tasty, and cooked exactly like I had requested. My boyfriend had his usual... a cheese pizza.  He was really happy with it and said the crust was really really good.  I took half the patty melt home and actually ate it, which is not typical with leftovers for me they usually end up in the trash.  

We will go back here for sure.  The space is small but nice, the bar area is great and has TV's and the The Orchard courtyard area is beautiful.  Parking sucks, we were luck to get a spot in the back.WOW really really great burgers.  Been looking for a place since arriving in Scottsdale and found it.   Truffle fries were awesome and aioli was to die for.  Can't wait to return again and again.!The food is all decently priced. The pho portions are huge and delicious. I would recommend the combo pho and the mango boba! The staff is friendly and the place is over all clean. It's a four star this time because some of the meat had hard pieces in it which I had not previously experienced here.If you're in the area it's a must to eat here. It's a very small establishment with limited seating but worth every penny. They give you generous portions for a decent price. I recommend the ACP #20!I ordered the enchiladas, and they were just right - excellent, homemade sauce, good proportions of tortilla and filling, right portion size. I was plenty happy with that. I got the queso dip, but it seemed a bit doughy, like the base sauce had too much flour. I'll give it another try before I decide whether this is a worthwhile trip.

My wife ordered the florentine nachos, and she was pleased with them. I wasn't a fan, but it could be because that was totally not what I was in the mood to eat. 

My son got regular nachos which were nothing to write home about.

My other son got the Philly Cheesesteak Fajita. Interesting concept, wasn't wild about the execution. 

The server was really nice and friendly, and the atmosphere is great for families. 

I'll be giving it another shot.The short version; hip decor and music, good staff, great food - would come back for sure.

Without reservation, was able to get seated within 5 minutes on the Wednesday before New Year's Eve.  To wait for a few here is a treat, as they have a very unique setup where 3 walls of the kitchen are behind glass (facing inside the dining room\/bar, the foyer, and the street) - always love places that expose the kitchen to the guests.

The newspaper menu is quite creative, seems to be a growing a trend which I'm a fan.  I also liked how simple it is, maybe 8 or so appetizers and about the same for the tacos with some daily specials for consideration.  Drinks were awesome, the oxaca old fashioned is small but packed punch and flavor, same for the Diablo margarita (bigger, 8-10 oz drink).  We started with a recommended guacamole which had tuna and some Asian flavoring which was delicious and portion matches the price.  Tacos were all good, however the house special octopus and the bistec were superior.

Only stumble was the last round of drinks came out slowly and did not seem to be a function of volume of people at the bar.  Minor blemish in and otherwise very good experience.

Pittsburgh price '$$' seem inconsistent to me, if it helps I got an app, 4 tacos and 5 drinks for ~$130.Food so beautiful it seduced me before my first bite. Rarely do I take time to note presentation, but the plates here are so meticulously crafted it would be a disservice to the chef to not recognize. From chips and salsa that come with mini-bowls of seasoned salts to a taco plate delivered with four separate saucers artfully displaying the ingredients, everything looks immaculate. Even better, it tastes as good as it looks. 

This was my second visit to Diego, and granted, on my first visit I had ordered a fruit salad that was good but not a substantial enough experience to judge the restaurant. On this visit, I decided to go for heartier Mexican fare and ordered the skirt steak tacos. 

Although I was not sure of the best way to administer the selection of signature seasoned salts onto the basket of chips, I really loved the creative touch. The salsas were delicious, and the salts provided a fun way to experiment with the flavors. 

The tacos were amazing. I would order them again without hesitation. The ingredients are delivered separately, so you are able to construct your own tacos. I love this because the tortillas do not get soggy, and you can customize the tacos to your exact personal preference. The steak was tender and cooked perfectly. And, although, I am not eating a lot of rice these days, their rice was worth cheating. It bursts with interesting flavors. 

My husband's steak looked amazing, and given the average price of a steak on the Strip, it was also a great deal. He loved it. 

And for the booze-lovers, they have an amazing tequila list. 

Given the attention to detail, I actually find it hard to imagine that anything would be less than tasty. We will be back!This is the BEST pizza that I have eaten in a long time and I do a lot of traveling around the world. You have the opportunity to build the pizza of your choice with fresh ingredients. I also give the staff 2 thumbs up for top notch customer service. This restaurant is located next to Uber rides below MGM and I stumbled up on it today. I will be back for sure. Excellent pizza and I am a picky eater.Sushi should be made to order, not picked from random containers. Do you know how long the sushi has been on the train? Why are so many people excited about this poor idea? Call me old fashioned, but I like traditional sushi bars. It's just average sushi, which can be had at lots of places.This place is delicious!! Best Asian food in the area.   Sushi is SO much better than yellow tail.Good go-to bar. Good service and the best beer options on town. Food is good, this is my go-to ace for a beer and wings or a pizza. Good adult atmosphere.Love this place! Delicious mexican food for a cheap price. Must try to queso!Their food name is very interesting, the place is adorable. We had one dish "pompier" and one"electrician". The electrician is too sour for me. In all, their food are not bad, but not as good as I expected.Wow! I had the pork belly w\/ Chinese broccoli. Flavor is amazing! Great quantity and quality for an affordable price. You gotta try that dish. Will be back to try othersThe actual restaurant is really cute, the menu is kind of limited, it's a lot of sandwiches (which they can serve with gluten free bread) and some breakfast. I ordered the soup of the day which was veggie ($5) however when I got it, it's seemed more like a mildly spicy chili (maybe the server got it wrong?) and it was cold :( . I was pretty full after that hearty 'soup' so I got the rest to go. I originally ordered the veggie burger but they were sold out of the that so I had to pick something else, the Vegan Rancheros: Scrambled tofu on corn tortillas with salsa, refried beans, guacamole & vegan cheese. ($12) This was actually really delicious, it's unfortunate by the time I got around to being hungry again it was cold as well but it was good even cold. It was a massive serving and I could smell it the whole time I walked home with it.Ever not want to go to the bathroom for a few days? Well if colon clogging is your deal then poutine is the way to go, ESPECIALLY with the poutine concoctions this place is dolling out - good lord! 

Don't get me wrong, when it's 3AM and Kris U is well into the sauce there is no other place I can find faster than Smoke's. Maybe it's because they've got locations all over the city... maybe it's because you can smell it from a mile away... maybe it's that EVERYONE you pass on the street in TO at that time is holding a poutine.. BUT MAYBE, it's because not unlike the mindless zombies in Walking Dead I'm drawn towards the noise, and bright lights of this shop (and that the contents of some poutines may even look like zombie feed). 

None the less, Poutine has rapidly become out national dish (thank you Quebec + Ottawa) and at XX AM, this is what I almost always crave, and based on late night check-ins on Yelp, I seem to always land at this location. My go to is a standard 
poo-tine or the pulled pork and bacon.

No matter what my after bar poison of choice it really makes no difference the result is always the same, short term gain (aka no puking and alcohol properly absorbed) and long term pain (no pooping, flatulence, or any sort of colo-rectal movement for the better part of 3-4 days). 

It's good, not great, but always does the trick. I'd like to say, nay nay will I ever visit them again. But we all know those who say it are lying through their teeth. 

Until we meet again Smokes.... Until we meet again

EC Out!To whom it may concern,

This morning Saturday, October 25th, 2014, myself and a group of 3 others visited your Denny's location in Las Vegas, NV at 12:20 am. (Address: 7071 W Craig Rd #101, Las Vegas, NV)

(12:20 AM) When walking in the door we were not greated, nor even aknoweledged. 

(12:30 AM) Only when another group of four walked in the door did the hostess come and take the group behind us to their table and left us standing at the doors.

(12:35 AM) We were finally asked the number of people in our group. At which time she said she would be back after clearing a table for us. 

(12:40 AM) We were seated and asked for our drink orders before we had our menus in hand. We asked her for waters so we could decide on drinks while she got the waters.

(1:15 AM) Another waitress, Irene, came by the table and asked us if we had ordered our drinks and we let her know we had asked for waters from the other girl and still had not recieved them 35 minutes since sitting down. She than took our drink orders - melted\/watered down Iced coffee and said she would be back to get our meal order in a minute. And we did not get the waters we asked for 35 minutes before.

(1:30 AM) We stopped Irene to ask her if she could get us hot coffee instead because our previous mentioned Iced coffees were still sitting there full because they were very bad. She got us new coffees right then and again said she would be back to get our meal order in a minute.

(1:45 AM) She finally came to get our order taken. And, we told her that we needed a strawberry milkshake to go when we got our check in a styrophome cup.

(1:55 AM) Our food was made and left to sit in the plate warmer. Did not see either waitresses anywhere...

(2:15 AM) The cook comes out of the kitchen to take our plates out because they'd been up in the window for so long and not picken up - still no sign of the waitresses. He tries to hand them to the wrong table - who have been sitting there 30 minutes without their drinks even ordered.

(2:20 AM) Our food is placed on our table by the *no name tag* watress. The fries are cold. The toast is soggy. No drink re-fills and no water glasses still given. We asked for syrup and honey mustard.

(2:22 AM) She brought one honey mustard. And I asked again for syrup to which she scoffed and walked off..

(2:30 AM) Asked again for the other honey mustard and the syrup to which the *no name tag* replied: "You are NEEDY." than walked off and brought back only the syrup... Still no offers for drink refills on all of our empty cups.

(2:45 AM) We were all done eating. Drinks and plates all empty - besides the food we decided not to eat because it was too burnt or soggy or cold.

(3:00 AM) Irene came by and asked if we wanted our check. She than took our dirty plates and added them to the table behind ours stack of dirty plates from an hour before when the other table left.

(3:05 AM) Check was brought to the table and offered up our credit card to pay the bill.

(3:20 AM) Irene finally showed up with the paid check and credit card totalling $57.11 and asked for the tip part to be filled out and for it to be signed.

(3:22 AM) Irene came back to get the signed copy of the receipt and saw that she was left with a (generous -  in reference the service we received) 89 cent tip - making our total come to $58.00. She said "I only get an 89 cent tip?" to which I replied "Yes, our service tonight between you and the other girl deserved that." and she said, "You think I was only worth 89 cents?" and I said, "Yes." So she picked up the signed copy and the customer copy and stormed off..

(3:25 AM) We exited the door and left.The Pastor, or seasoned pork, with onion and pineapples is amazing! The staff are super friendly and patient with a newcomer like me.Two trips here in a week, and I will be back for more.  Good beer, good atmosphere, decent food, and fantastic servers make for a great time, especially when it sits across the street from my house!  

First time was with my relative, who was staying at the Red Rock but wanted to see the house so we decided to cross the street and have a couple of beers.  On a Wednesday night they were pretty busy, and despite only wanting to drink and not eat, they were more than happy to have us.  Our server, Elizabeth, was super sweet and super cute.  The beer aren't great bargains ($5\/$8 for a typical 12\/24oz bottles), but it does get a bit less expensive during happy hour (4-6pm).

Last night, my friends and I decided to head over for some food and drinks, and despite being full and having to find a table for 8, they were very pleasant and speedy.  We ordered a bunch of  Philly Fries and Nachos, with the former being great and the latter pretty good.  Liked the fact that the nachos had real steaks though.  I'd like to try the rest of the menu eventually.  The server (never got her name) was again very awesome, and they are the real reasons I like coming here.  Experience never goes sour when service is great!

Table-for-1 Factor:  It's a bar & grill and they have a large bar area, so I can see myself parking here alone on those nights when I need to catch a game.La Poutine au porc effiloché est malade ! Les Ribs sont sportifs pour les amateurs du CH.Words cannot even begin to express how thankful I am for everything you did for me today. My birthday happy hour was a HUGE success thanks to the wonderful staff at Sol Cocina.  Sharon, thank you so much for making sure me and my guest had plenty of places to sit and mingle. That area was PERFECT! Lorena, girl you took care of about 40 people in a 3+ hour time frame! You ROCKED! Thank you so much. Josh, OMG Josh! Thank you so much for putting up my "rowdy" group LOL!  Seriously, your entire team welcomed me with open arms and everyone had a great time. The food and the drinks, OMG the drinks!! Thank you to Sol Cocina for keeping the Farmers Market-Strawberry-Kiwi Margarita on the menu for me for that extra day. It was DELICIOUS!! ( I stopped at two but I really wanted three) Up next... Taco Tuesday anyone? :)I went to Koto Ramen for the first time recently, I got the pork ramen with pork base. Basically, it's just okay. 

The good - interior design is nice, looks kinda upscale-ish. Sleek, hip, cool. The staff is friendly. Nice, helpful, friendly. The food is alright. Noodles, vegetables, and broth are all tasty. 

The bad - the pork was really poor quality. Thin, tough, tasteless. The price was too high for the quality of the food. Overpriced, steep, $8 for a bowl of mediocre ramen?!

It's not that great. If you're on campus and in the mood for ramen, go for it, on a date with someone who wants ramen? Okay. Otherwise, avoid it.

But that's just my preference.My whole family loves coming to eat here. Best Mexican food in AZ. We're what you'd call "Mexican food snobs" as I grew up with my Nana making homemade Mexican food and my mother in law comes in twice a year from Mexico spoiling us with her food. This place is real authentic food. My go to is the carne en su jugo or the birria. Very tender and flavor meat. My husband loves the chilaquiles and the caldo de pollo and albondigas are very good. You really can't go wrong with whatever you order. My husband is from Mexico and he knows good Mexican food, this is only one of 3 places we will ever eat Mexican food, because we know we will be disappointed. While waiting for your food, take a look at the shops they have. They have a clothing store, an accessory\/toy store, barber shop, natural medicine store, and more. My husband can also send money to his family down south and get his meal in one spot. We love it here and the service is great. It also gets very packed so beware, but they do their best to keep up. You won't be disappointed.Some of the best tacos and margaritas in town. The nachos were delicious and the surf and turf taco was great. I loved the freshness of the ingredients. The muddled jalapeno margarita is definitely worth a try.This place is tremendous, an excellent option for a burger when stopping through this area of Charlotte. I had wanted to go here for a while before my roommate and I actually went. It was a Sunday, the night of the Golden Globes, though we were treated to 60 Minutes on our table-exclusive television. That was a nice touch. Not many people were in the restaurant, which was a good way to spend a quiet evening. The wait staff is very nice and helpful. I had a salad as a side, and it was very good. My roommate got National Bohemian beer to go with his burger, but I just got water. I had a Fender Bender, and it was positively enormous. It took a Herculean effort to finish, although not having eaten all day helped. I highly recommend going here if you get the chance. It is perhaps a little pricier than some of the other places around, like the Diamond, but when you see the portion, you understand why.First time at Lou's. We've been driving by for years and stopped in. Great food and service. We had breakfast and will definitely be back to try lunch!This is pretty much a worse version of chipotle.  I went here on taco Tuesday but was not super impressed with what the tacos looked liked so I got a burrito.  The burrito was okay I just thought it was bland.  I got the hot sauce on it and it wasn't very hot.  

The staff here were very polite and good with everyone.  They were friendly.  Even though it was crowded they didn't act irritated at all.

The cost here is okay.  It's kind of expensive but not too bad.  $2 taco Tuesday is a good deal but my $9 burrito wasn't worth it.Came here for lunch with a co-worker. Started with chips and 2 kinds of salsa. One was a traditional mild salsa, the other was blazing hot, which made me very happy. The beef enchilada was awesome. I ordered 1 a la carte, and it was plenty of food. My co-worker had beef flautas and loved them. We arrived just as they opened, and when we left, the place was packed. Obviously the locals know it's great authentic Mexican food.Had dinner on Thursday 8\/30\/12. Ordered a ground beef chimi and two taco plates. Jennifer, our server, gave us excellent service. Unfortunately the chimi was so so and the tacos were cold. We sent the tacos back and the next orders were warm with the first bite and also cold in the middle. Obviously management doesn't care when someone receives horrible food because no one came by to see if they could do anything or    If we wanted something else. We won't eat here again.After seeing a viral NYC sushi burrito video, I've been searching high & low everywhere to try it somewhere in the GTA but all options were either pop-up shops or food trucks (which I do not have time to follow & chase).

When we heard Corner By Spoon and Fork started serving this we immediately rushed there (from Markham) to check it out on a Friday night and we were not disappointed at all!

The decor was very modern and clean with a faux fireplace, think Starbucks style but much larger.

Ordering Process:
It was intimidating as first since there were so many options to choose from, but the chef was very helpful. There are 5-6 recommended combinations or you can create your own custom sushi burrito. For custom you can choose 1 protein + 1 green + 4 toppings + 1 sauce. I ended up building my own which consists of sashimi tuna + arugula + inari age (fried tofu skin) + avocado + tempura bits + julienne mango + spicy mayo. When the food arrived it was served with a soy sauce and wasabi packet. The total came out around $12-$15 which was a little expensive but expected as there are only a few places that serve sushi burrito.

Food:
The food was amazing, all the ingredients were very fresh and the nori was not too chewy or too soft, it was perfect for holding all of the ingredients together while still being able to snap apart as you bite into the burrito. I would definitely revisit to try more combinations of their sushi burrito.

I become such a fan that I made my own spreadsheet which includes all proteins\/greens\/toppings options to build my own sushi burrito combinations for my next visit!

Second Visit:
I came here a 2nd time hoping to try something else on the menu, the seared pork chops with fried rice. I am very disappointed in this dish, the fried rice was bland and the pork chops was dry. I would recommend sticking to sushi burrito if you visit Corner.Pleasantly surprised with this location. Planned on Sunday morning brunch and was ready to have to wait to be seated but that wasn't the case. Other IHOP locations I've been to in the past are a little too busy for me on a weekend morning but we had a nice experience. Our server was friendly and pretty attentive. Food was probably out within ten minutes of ordering. Will definitely be back again.Signora Gaga and Mama Mia are my favorite. Excellent and speedy service. They'll have your pizza ready in 5-10 minutes. Authentic Italian crust. Love, love, love it!This place is a great addition to the area. 
The food is great and the service is exceptional!

Definitely worth checking out!I really like this place. I have gone there several times with a colleague from Turkey and he vouches for it being genuine. The food is great and the service fast.The food is delicious! I went with a group of friends for dinner, we all started with the potato pancakes. They were fried to perfection and served with sour cream and apple sauce. I couldn't keep my hands away from then. For main course I had the New Yorker with potato salad. Being from NYC area, I been missing a lot of my hometown staples and this helped. Get ready to get messy its a big sandwich. Ended with some cheesecake which is heavenly, definitely a place I will be returning to. Interior is clean, staff is friendly and knowledge, and prices are decent.My daughter and I walked out pre order after wasting 20 minutes or moving in line.  They had about 15 workers with no leadership.The food is excellent and the wait staff is knowledgeable and helpful. There are a lot of restaurants in Indian Land, but my out-of-town guests always opt for this. Except for the Friday night fish fry, it is usually not crowded. However, reservations are suggested. It is very convenient to Waxhaw via Jim Wilson Road. 

Note that it is in the clubhouse of a public golf course in the middle of Sun City Carolina Lakes. There is a guardhouse at the entrance, but it is for information only, since the roads are now public.I gave this place a third try thinking it could get better since it serves similar food like Sunset's Oyster Bar. Note to self....NO WAY! First, the service was horrible. We never got out waters, bread, utensil until 20minutes of sitting. When we did get our waters, the waitress didn't seem to have a good day. At the end, she somewhat warmed up to us?

The food is nothing like the other Station casinos. Just pricier and less taste. The oysters were so small unlike Sunset (sorry, gotta compare). I will not go back to Tides. No! No! However, my fave is Sunset Oyster BarThis is a decent spot for your typical Chinese food fix. The interior is nicer than your average Chinese restaurant, and the food is pretty good as well. I've been here quite a few times now and I haven't had a really bad experience yet. The servers are speedy but they will forget to bring you what you ask for (small things like hot water, chili oil - I have asked for them multiple times during my meals and they never deliver my requests). 

Afternoon tea special is from 3:00pm to 5:00pm any day of the week. They have great deals if you come here for a late lunch or an early dinner! The red bean freeze with ice cream drink is delicious. 

Something to note: I noticed the food portions have decreased between my last two visits.This is a great bar and restaurant and such a fun place to go to watch a sporting event or hang with friends.   We like to go sit in the Mark Fine red room for UNLV rebel games.   I love the app and all the technology they've incorporated into the business and I think PKWY is awesome and the owner is a genius.Excellent food, quick and friendly service.  Margarita's are very tasty and well worth the price.This buffet was better than I expected! As a pescatarian we read reviews and thought this might be our best bet and I think it was. The buffet venue itself is beautiful. I loved the latkas and amazing salad selections. There were way more veggie options than the other buffets I have visited in Vegas. They did not have shrimp cocktail though and that is a highlight for me at the bellagio so I did miss that. Overall good selection, service, clean bathrooms. I would come back again when looking for a Vegas buffet.I have written to them multiple times they don't fix anything so maybe some constant public social shaming will do the trick, watch for my Foursquare, Facebook, Twitter, and Google reviews coming soon. This time I ordered a made to order the salad, with fries, I said LIGHT ranch, and add medium hot sauce in the comments. They gave me a small side of hot sauce in a cup not mixed in the salad. Like I said I ordered the salad with fries, left a comment please chop fries into the salad...Nope, COLD fries in a bag. Every time I go there it gets worse, and smells more and more like a garbage dumpster.I went to this restaurant, the food was priced expensive, $26-$48! I don't mind paying for that if the food is that great, this was not... The mashed potatoes were a ball with this dark brn stuff that had chunks (who serves burned gravy?!). I live in the neighborhood and was very disappointed, not returning...It's fun here yet it's our first time with my co-worker. Cool with the group. It's actually a good experience with my co nurses. Cocktail Drinks and finger foods was great. We enjoyed at the beginning singing and dancing. All i can say is a great and fun to go with.This Grimaldi's is A~OK if your in the area looking for good pizza.  I usually rave about one of the other Girmaldi locations to my friends and since we were in the area we thought, why not try this Grimaldi's.  After all it's a Girmaldi's and the Patsy Girmaldi's in DC Ranch taste a like the Girmaldi's in New York. 

We were a little concerned when we arrived since this place was very slow and it was during peak lunch time.  The service was ok not exceptional but good. I usually don't have to ask for a refill on my beverage at the other location, but here I did twice...  The decor of this Grimaldi's is very nice.  I found myself starring at the ceiling more than once thinking: "better not bring my bride here; she'll want me to do this to our ceiling in the den"! 

Lunch~ antipasto salad. The fresh mozzarella was very good, oven roasted sweet red peppers were too cold and not seasoned, the salami was sliced very thin and offered only four pieces (lacking), some olives and some fresh baked bread.  The mozzarella and bread were the stars of this dish ~ everything else let you wanting more or something different.  Personal pizza ~ white garlic with fresh tomatoes.  For the first time ever I had to add salt to my pizza, what the heck? The crust was full of the deliciousness goodness I'm used to at Grimaldi's, crispy and scrumptious but the white cheesy and garlicky toppings needed more seasoning...

The calzones my colleagues had were delish and they ate everything in sight including the left over sauce from their calzones.  I would come back again but for dinner not lunch.  The bar area seemed to be the place to be in this location. This is where you want to sit so you can watch the pizza dough flying before they load it into their brick oven, have some beer or wine but order a different kind of pizza!The Green Bay chili was awesome!!! Chips and salsa was really good.  The rest was not so great. Probably won't be back.  Waitress was very nice but my order was messed up, took way too long to get it fixed.Wow! Fairly new restaurant. We stopped in with family for Sunday morning breakfast and found it delicious, quick, great wait staff, no waiting for a table (we got here at 9 am). Portions are generous and tasty! We really enjoyed it. Outdoor seating available too.This IHOP is just like your typical one, and doesn't really make an exceedingly negative or positive impression. Of course the highlight of this restaurant is their extensive breakfast menu, which always includes fun, seasonal, and exceptionally sweet pancake options. If that's what you're looking for than this is the place to go. It's very casual, so would definitely be a spot that the kids would enjoy, especially with their dessert like breakfast options. It's never too crowded so wait time is usually not an issue.  A step up from a small town diner, but this it lacks that charm as it is a chain restaurant. If you want some place cute and quaint this doesn't really fit the bill,  but if you are in the mood for a cinnamon roll pancake then this is the place to be.Service was very prompt. I got the Lamb Burger (outstanding) wife got the Runnelstone burger. We ordered the Appetizer sampler (the cheese curds and mac and cheese wedges are incredible) they have a great selection of micro brews. And fairly priced as wellSorry Showmars.  I remember I used to visit occasionally long time ago as my neighbor like your place.  I stopped by to pick up some dinner after I landed at airport. I chose your fried steak with green and salad to go.  Sound healthy, right ?
Besides salad, I almost have to throw the rest away.  The fried steak was actually 2 pieces of heavy breaded minced meat (wondering if they were beef) with gravy, hardly feel there was meat.  the green was way over cooked like yellowish, mushy vegetables with heavy salt and oil that triggered my blood pressure.
Not to mention the price was about $8.  After four hours, my taste bud still feel that salt and oil in my throat.  I guess next time, I rather have a bad-rep MacDonald burger for a couple of dollar instead.This restaurant has pros and cons. The hostess was less than pleasant. We waited on a table at the bar, but we had to ask for it again about an hour and a half later. It appeared that we were bothering the hostess because we wanted a table and she was going to have to set it. She was less than appreciative of our patronage. Not something you would really like when your dropping $150 on dinner for two. The bar had poor service. The bar tender seemed depressed and was not attentive. Had it not been for the bar back up we prob would not have gotten our drinks and cheese plate. When we did get to our table the waiter was fantastic and turned things around. He exceeded our waiter expectations and made the large restaurant feel small. My husband had the duck. He thought it was ok- not anything memorable. I had the pork tenderloin. It was good. The plate had a nice presentation which I appreciated. The best thing by far was the dessert. It was a pistachio cheesecake with a bourbon glaze and candied cornflakes. The dessert had a lot going on, but it was so complimentary. It worked very well together. Hats off to the pastry chef!! I really wish I could rate this place higher, but the hostess really prevented that. I would like to return some time and see her not there-- hint hint!There is this tree just inside the women's washroom. One of the branches poked around the door as I was opening it and hit me right in the eye. Pretty idea, poor execution. I was here for a private party and the servers were severely overworked. Despite the little annoyances of eye pokes and slow service, the food wasn't bad. Overall, the okay food didn't save the evening but two stars for ambiance!We are in the middle of renovating our condo (and using our stove is impossible) so I had supper this evening at the Dog & Bear, which is in our 'hood.

I had the burger and beer special ... a Dog and Bear Burger (without cheese or onions) and fries and a pint of Mill Street Organic.  It was a great deal for $15!  The burger and fries were delicious and the beer was tasty.  I'd get it again.

Racheal was my server.  She was friendly and took good care of me.Wife and I came in tonght for a couple of Medium sized Blizzards. Fanasitc quick service! We are very please who awesome everyon was. Thanks!We came here for a quick lunch. I had the sixteen spice chicken salad, and it was a tiny portion. My bf had the pork sandwhich which was better, and we also tried a pumpkin soup. The salmon and tuna tartares were good. I don't think I walked away being a fan of tex mex food.One of the best places around.  Never disappoints and always open.  The late night menu is great and the bartenders are fun.  Great place to eat any time of day.Best Indian food I've had in the city. We ordered the butter chicken, tandoori chicken, naan and samosas. All excellent and tasty. The mango lassi is also very good.This is a great place to chill and grab sound good, easy food and drinks on an awesome patio.  The staff is nice and helpful, as well as easy going.  No stuffed shirts here!  

Their nachos are pretty great.  They make their own tortilla chips which makes them different than most.  Their food is comforting and simple.  Perfect for an easy weekend meal.This is one of the, nope, the best bbq joint ever. We had the outlaw burger which was sick, perfect blend of taste and crunch from the onions. No need to request medium rare as the burgers smoked to perfection. The biggin dads favorite had a mix of 3 meats that taste like they were bred in the same farm. I cant say how happy we are with the food and service. The hot sauce made my buddy tear up, tasty stuff. I feel like I can make a mess of myself,  wear a bib made of paper napkins and feel proud doing it. Free refills on the drinks and quality friendly staff make this place a obvious no 1 choice for bbq. Gordon ramsey abd his 20dollar burger can rot compared to a gem like this. one of the best burgers I ever tasted. The staff is so wholesome and authentically country with the way they carry themselves and the food, by mere presence they made me think they are co owners with the pride they have for their food. I didnt detect any of the fake kindness you often see at regular food joints. The owners should be proud of themselves and their staff.As I walked in my nose was greeted by an all to familiar smell....Trinidadian home cooking.....

As I looked up a warm smile greeted me. She said her name was Addy. "What can I get you"... this is happening 10 mins before the restaurant is suppose to close and she was so sweet most people would have given me the (stink face ) for walking in 10 mins before closing time!! 

Let's talk food..... I got the curry oxtail with rice & peas also a stewed chicken w\/ rice & peas... 

I'm, what people call an inspector! I inspect all of my take-out food before leaving any restaurant. 

The food looked and smelled amazing, just like my mom and grandma used to cook. 

The curry oxtail was moist and slid right off the bone. The rice & peas was soooo good. WoW!!! The rice wasn't clumpy each rice grain was fluffy and soft.  

The curry was just enough that it didn't take away from the oxtail also to my surprise there was potato in the curry. Which gave the curry a nice thickness. 

The stewed brown chicken was delicious. The meat is all dark meat so if you want white meat make sure you make that clear. The gravy was a smooth and silky. I was sure I was eating grandma's cooking again........

Two drinks: one drink called a Ting (grapefruit soda) one ginger beer (it's soda not beer) 

All in all this please is a hole in the wall but the food is amazing if you're ever in Glendale, check it out. 

Also shout out to the gentlemen who works with Addy. I'm not sure what is name is but he was so nice and spoke to me about Trinidad..... Okay now I need to book a ticket....I've never been inside, only through the drive thru but their coffee is great and they have so many flavors to choose from. I like the toasted marshmallow iced coffee. The owner and workers are very nice and will take your order even after they're closed if they're still there. Go visit! There's a drive through, you don't even need to wear pants!This is a cool place, with a fabulous house band. The food was good, but the pricing left us cold. Last week we split a full rack of ribs, and the server brought us beans and cole slaw instead of potatoes and corn because we're low carb dieters. We were charged the menu prices and were happy.

Last night we returned and did the same, plus the $3.95 house salad that comes with an entree. We were charged $5.95 for the house salad, because the server decided we wanted a larger salad, and $1.50 x 2 for changing the sides because the chef said no subs were allowed. We won't be back.My family and I went for Sunday brunch and the food was delicious. Meredith was our waitress and she was amazing. The atmosphere was nice. The only issue was some of the food was a little cold.Food is good, but the service is horrible.  Trying to order today, they were not busy, I was the only person in line and it took 10 minutes, largely due to the fact the counter person abruptly left and took several minutes to come back.  Did apologize, but the person that followed him out was obviously upset with a customer and stated so, loudly.  We've been there quite a few time, but to be honest, there are other delis just as good with service and employees who appreciate you coming in .We were here on Sarurday night, live music coverband no entrance fee. Recommend it for a laid back sing along to Eric Clapton leyla kind of night. We had a nice time and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves.The fall-off-the-bone ribs and tender, succulent brisket ranks as some of the best barbecue I have ever had. Include sausage, beans and a pile of fries for good luck, and you have yourself one heck of a fabulous meal. While I gorged unashamedly on my Q Platter, the family attacked big, juicy burgers flowing with melted cheese, chili, onion rings and a boatload of other fresh fixings. And the generous portion of bread pudding we shared for dessert was killer, too.

Part sports bar, part uptown nightspot, and part family eatery, the Q features something in their atmosphere that makes everyone feel welcome. The Q is King in my book.Thanks for the free baklava with check-in! YEE loves you!

Stephano's is a great for a quick lunch time bite. I recently had their shrimp kebab greek salad, and it was great. Lettuce, olives, tomatoes, onions, feta, and char grilled shrimp. Would have loved the addition of another veggie though and if the shrimp was warm. Came with warm wheat or white pita. Always a nice plus. Portion was huge. I couldn't finish it. 

We ate at the patio area, which was really pleasant with the good weather. The food was super prompt.

Just one note to the staff: please stock napkins by the condiments and utensils. Some of us are messy. =)Great sandwich for the price!  Ordered the footlong 'Wanna be a Reuben' and it was well worth it!  Served on a tasty parmesan roll and filled with pastrami and coleslaw.  It's a great place to go if you're looking for take out sandwiches\/food!This place is amazing.  Servings generous, food sumptuous.  Take for what it is:  a hole in the wall but if you want great food, you have to check this place out.  I ordered the grilled chicken and it would feed at least two people.  All for $10.50 including tax.  I can't believe the other review gave it a mediocre rating because it didn't have wifi.  Jesus Christ, if you want Wifi go to a godd@m Starbucks or Timmy's.  Can't anyone just sit down, relax and enjoy a good meal without having to check their phones every other f--king minute?  No wifi.  Give me a f--king break.I don't understand why people like this place because the food isn't great. Perhaps the drinks are cheaper than a lot of the places around so it might make the food potentially seem like it taste better because we're drunk. Regardless, it's a great place if ur looking to have fair prices on drinks, but not a place I would recommend for food.Horrible is a small word for this place. Service sucks big time. Wait times are crazy. 
We checked in at 9 on a Saturday night and they are out of fish, mutton. Seriously!!!!!!I have had other revolving sushi bars before.  This place was ok... it worked for a craving.  Other revolving sushi bars have been able to keep their product cold and fresh...Kiku lacked that aspect.  When we were trying dishes, many were room temp, and not the chilled cold you look for in raw sushi.  They are also very stingy with their wasabi, and not very attentive.  All in all, we will not be back again.  We will travel to Scottsdale to get our revolving sushi fix.Service was excellent! Our waitress, (I think her name was Holanda since that was the name on our receipt) was incredibly friendly and helpful. She provided great recommendations on the menu and made sure we were satisfied with everything. I also cannot say enough good things about the pizza! The pizza was light, refreshing and tasty. I had the Autunelle pizza which was amazing! Definitely recommend this pizza place!!Ordered online and made a note to not ring the doorbell because we have a sick family member sleeping. Paid with card online and was told it would take 40 minutes. An hour and 15 minutes later the delivery guy Randy rang the doorbell and asked for payment because there records showed it wasn't paid for, despite my verification email. Shortly after he left, he called me from his personal phone saying that we still didn't pay and that he would wait on hold while I checked my bank statement . I hung up and called the store to have it resolved and make payment if still necessary with a supervisor, just to find out that Randy was the supervisor and they "figured it out". 
Literally only gave this place these 2 stars because the pizza and breadsticks were delicious as usual. Probably won't order again though due to the lack of attention to detail, poor management, and failure to stand by their delivery times as stated.This little podunk diner at the resort is a sweet stop for breakfast or lunch. Their ultra thick french toast was the bomb dot com and then some. The service was awesome and very caring. The cooks were super cool and fast. The decorations around the joint gave a very old fashioned 60s feel that made the atmosphere more relaxed. It is definitely a great breakfast and lunch place.Don't stay here unless you like to be charged for ice. I even stayed in the spa suite. Any other hotel ice would be complimentary.Went here on the spur of the moment on a Thursday night. Promptly greeted very nicely by the hostess and told it would be about 15 minutes. No big deal. Looked for a seat at the bar and the server working the bar area pointed out an empty table we hadn't seen. So our 15 minutes turned out to be 5. So far so good. 

The good:
1. Service was good. The server promptly greeted us and gave out table a little extra wiping. Drink orders taken quickly and brought to the table quickly. 
2. The menu is ok. After all, it is a burger place but there are several selections available if you don't want a burger. 
3. Ordered my burger medium and it was actually medium. That seems to be hard to find anymore. The burger was very tasty and really just the right size. 

The not so good ( don't want to say bad because it wasn't. Just eh)
1. $3.50 for a side of tots or fries with my burger? They don't come with? I saw that on the menu and assumed it meant if I wanted a side order of them not pay or you don't get them. Both the tots and my wife's fries were nothing I couldn't get an entire bag of at Giant Eagle for the same price. 
2. The TV's showing what I assuming was the Wahlburg's reality show was a bit weird. It was on at least 2 TV's with no sound. Not that I wanted to hear it but I think having shows that require you to listen on in a bar is stupid. 

Overall I think this place is, meh. Nothing special and nothing to make me want to return. I think the best description is; it's not a place that you plan to go to but rather somewhere you end up at.This restaurant was just not good. We split two rolls, tempura king crab and a side of corn. The rice was beyond sticky on the roll and had turned into a paste. I've had better at chain restaurants. The corn was way overpriced for what it is about a half cup of corn.The service need some improvement be more friendly the sushi are alright I give a 3 star overalFood here is delicious. The service was great. The atmosphere is casual and relaxed. I had steak fajitas and recommend them. I will be back for more! :)What an overall disappointing experience.  We sat and waited forever for the teppanyaki experience to begin.  It was mediocre at best.  We won't be back.  The food quality is not very good.Went there with two friends last night our first time eating korean and it exceeded our expectations.... delicious! We got the vegetable balls and toppokki (delicious btw) and for the main courses short rib galbi, chicken bugolgi, and pork bibimbop, wonderful! i have no idea what all these negative reviews are about, and this place is much better than the ratings its given.3.5 stars for complete lack of service but the food was really good. 
The wait is really long!!!!!! PREPARE YOURSELF! Waited about 2 hours. I hope it's good and worth it. The host kept telling our group another 20 mins... then another 30 mins... gradually extending the time until finally 2 hours has passed...
At this point it's nearly 940-945 that we are seated.  We ask the host of its possible to get the $18 price for 10pm since we've been waiting sooooo long and he says no.. by the way his name is Scott. They also ran out of the skirt steak. Bummed yet again. 
I'm in customer service and I make damn sure to make the person happy. So it hits me hard when I rate a restaurant. And he's doing the opposite of this. We do get our food and I'm really happy with it. Is it the best I've had? Probably not but it was really good (maybe because we were starving for 2 hours). Ok I'll talk about some positives - lots of variety of meats (like green tea pork belly), other things besides meats for AYCE (Korean fried chicken, sushi - but the orders are small! We had to order multiple for us). I do wish they had more ban chan. We had to ask several times for refills...
When dessert comes around (which is cool because it's included in the AYCE) we are tired and have been there for 4 hours and just want to go home. I ask Scott if there are to go containers that he can put the ice cream in and yet again he says no. Cmon Scott. 
So just to warn everyone! Food is great, service is not. I guess that's just how your typical Asian restaurants roll. I should have expected this.Ok I see this place is busy but must be because of out of towners because the food is meh!! The food is mediocre. I have never been to a dim sum restaurant that does not have any hao cao. Every time the carts come by, I would ask " u have ha cao?" The answer was " it 's coming."  We were there 2 hours and it never came. Heard the wait staff tell a Chinese customer there is no ha cao. What the heck? How can u call yourself a dim sum restaurant and not serve ha cao? That's like going to a Mexican restaurant that doesn't serve enchiladas or tacos.  I was totally disappointed. The dishes were not hot- a no no for Asian restaurant. Will never go again- only went because the hubby loved it.  There are way better dim sum places on spring mountain road- Chinatown\/vietnatown of Las Vegas.I have lived in the area way too long to not have ever been to this restaurant.  Met up with friends for Saturday dinner to rectify that.  Adovada tamales were, of course, spicy but also quite flavorful.  Some of the best chips and salsa I have ever had and I can verify that the Kick-Ass Margarita is aptly named.  Great food, great service, great experience.Amazing! Great atmosphere really good food and even better beer. Try the hatch chili beer; light refreshing with a little kick to it. Do not leave without trying the key lime pie, this homemade delicacy will be worth it!Great atmosphere! Extremely entertaining casino! The bartenders and the dealers had great attitudes and were there to make sure you had a good time as well. Definitely recommend one of those margarita blenders. :) If you're a parrot head then definitely make a stop at the Margaritaville casino!!I had a great experience here during my first night in Vegas. My friend and I shared the pretzels to start and then I got the chopped salad without ham. Everything I ate was delicious! The pretzels and dips were to die for and the salad was perfectly balanced in flavor and felt like a relatively healthy option compared to some of the other things on the menu. My friend really enjoyed her pesto chicken sandwich and fries as well. 
The portions were huge so I felt like you weren't ripped off by any stretch considering it was a meal on the strip. Our server was AWESOME too, I wish I had gotten his name. Super friendly and on point, even gave me a refill of my soda in a to go cup which I thought was such a nice touch. 
I only knocked one star off because the entrees took SO long to come out considering the place was less than half full....if they figured that out I think the restaurant would definitely deserve a 5* review.Got their asada (steak) burrito for $6.40 and medium horchata for $1.85. They give free chips\/salsa for orders over $5.My lousiana fried chickn was quite good. Tho mashed potato and gravy was little bland. I like spicy food & probably expected it to be spicy. Mushroom gravy poutine was really good. Hubby had double burger and I liked that BBQ flavor. The portion sizes are huge. 2 big eaters couldn't finish everything and left very full & satisfied. My carnivore husband wants to go back for my lousiana chickn sandwich. Curb appeal needed a little work. Windy day brought trash right in front of their main entrance.Tasty meals for 5$! This concept is not necessarily new in Montreal but it was well executed here. I had the pasta with smoked salmon and was surprised by how flavorful it was. The portions are smaller but still filling enough. I recommend getting two dishes if you're very hungry. I didn't have a cocktail and I was disappointed to see that my simple lemonade cost 5$... Still, overall it's a lovely place to grab drinks and some cheap eats.There are many celebrity chefs flooding the Vegas market. Emeril has been here for awhile so I think his standard fair at his restaurants are tested and true recipes with service that has been honed over time. When going to an Emeril restaurant you are most likely going to have a good meal with good service.

My mother and I ate here for lunch on their Restaurant Week 2014 menu. My one and only dining experience for this season's RW, unfortunately. We arrived shortly after they opened and were seated in the empty front dining area. Our server was prompt and courteous, continually checking on us throughout the meal and our drinks were topped off consistently.

My mother and I both started off with the Boston Salad that came with big, leafy greens, giant tomatoes, big chunks of bacon, and buttermilk ranch dressing with fresh cracked black pepper. Phenomenal! I could have this salad just as an entree and be fine. The quality of the lettuce was exceptional and each bite was crisp and enjoyable.

Next, my mother chose the peach roasted chicken and I wish I had gotten it too! It was flavorful, tender, and juicy, with a crispy skin, and spiced perfectly. It came with a savory bread pudding and grilled mushrooms. 

I opted for the lobster ravioli which was disappointing. While the raviolis themselves were well cooked and stuffed nicely with lobster the tomato butter it was served in was terribly off-putting for me and I really disliked the Cajun flavor to it (I know, Emeril's cooking style IS Cajun!), but still just not great in my opinion and very lackluster. It came topped with cuts of asparagus and not even they could pick the dish up.

Lastly, dessert was delish. I had the Chocolate Mousse Cake, which was so so decadent, but fluffy and sinfully sweet. My mother opted for the very famous banana cream pie (which I have had before), and she said it was exquisite. 

Overall the disappointment in my main entree was balanced by the good service, salad, and dessert. I am sure this miss with the entree is an exception, not a consistency.There's the good and the bad. The good is the top notch food & coffee. The Spanish hash was amazing & my wife lived her steak & eggs. 

The downside is the service & very long wait for the food. It was Friday brunch when we were there so fairly busy, but the service is very slow & from seating to food arrival was at least 45 mins. We're used to efficient service at brunch joints.

Took the shine off the excellent food.Gargantuan portions!  Chicken and waffles are to die for. Pair that with their bloody marys and I'm over the moon.  The only time I haven't waited to sit at a table was arriving at 7 AM after an epic night out which made the giant portions of food even tastier as you can imagine.First and foremost I have to really praise this place and the housekeeping staff. I had left my bag in my room when i checked out and did not realize it until i got home to california. I had very expensive things in that bag including perfumes, hair starightner and curler etc.... When i called and spoke to the front desk she got in contact with housekeeping and they located the bag. I thought to myself "oh great they located it but is everything going to still be in it when i receive it in the mail"? I received my bag about 3 or 4 days after calling and guess what EVERYTHING was in there exactly like it was when i left. I was so Happy!!!!! I like the rooms also. They are pretty spacious and big with a nice big window and view. The only complaint i have is there really disgusting gross cafe!!!! Ewww sooooooo gross. My family has tried it twice and both times we were so disgusted. I even got my money back for my husband hamburger. He asked for well done and i swear the middle was raw and cold. My bacon even looked undercooked and i asked her to have them make it crispy. Those strips were sooooo flimsey. YUCK!!!!! DO NOT EAT AT THE CAFE... THE SERVICE ALSO SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Une cuisine audacieuse qui saura vous fera lécher vos doigts!
Cuisine incroyable!
Très carnivore mais même en tant que végétarienne je pouvais voir la qualité de la viande (et secondé par ma mère)

---

Audacious cuisine that will make you lick your fingers!
Great presentation!
Very carnivorous, but even as a vegan woman, I was able to see that the meat seemed good (an seconded by my mother)Hands down the best BBQ Ribs I've every had, and you add in the price this can't be beat!  You also can get huge $2 draft beers along with a full meal for cheap with your players card and a coupon.  The meat comes completely off the bone and the BBQ sauce is great!  A small place and it can get busy, but if you want a great meal for cheap and great BBQ, YOU NEED TO GO TO ELLIS ISLAND!!!So I haven't updated this review in a while, and thought I should mention that they have resolved my one gripe, location.  I used to have to drive clear across town to get my Broadway fix, but last year, they opened a location at Sahara and Cimmaron (right down the street from me).

Same food, different place.  Many of the people there are splitting shifts from the other location, so many of the same faces.  I am almost reticent to tell anyone about this location, because it isn't nearly as busy and location #1 yet.  But if it's kept secret, they won't be able to afford to keep it open, and that would be worse, I guess.

Oh, and I think the mural is almost done too, looks good so far.

One last thing worth mentioning:  In my early travels to Broadway, I found myself having a hard time choosing between their Rolls (a rolled up pizza of sorts) and the Chicken Fingers (spicy!).  So rather than choosing, I came up with my own creation:  The Spicy Chicken and Pepperoni Roll.  It's the best of both worlds.  It's pizza with chicken fingers in it.  As if either wasn't bad enough for you.  If you like both things, try it.  Yummy for my tummy.  

I see Yelp is doing photos now, so next time I am over there, I will upload a photo of this masterpiece.  Oh, and the other great part is that it is pretty frickin huge, which means I always take half of it home.  Nowadays that's part of why I get it, because I have half for later.  Can you say Fourthmeal?  After an evening of WoW, I'm cravin me some spicy chicken and pepperoni roll.

Man, I'm ready for some lunch.Great food! Everything is very fresh and tasty. Service is a bit disorganized at times. But food makes it worth it!This place is awesome!! From young to old! This place has it all. it's hard to believe this is because of one dedicated man!! if you see him running around with his headlamp on say hi and tell him what a great job he does.  they've got old pinball clear through the decades to the newest machines available. huge row of old arcade machines as well. My fav is the dome hockey! Flash back to the 80s. love this place .. Come here often. A must see in Vegas if ur a pinball fan or arcade gamer!!! Long live the pinball hall of fame!!Some girlfriends and I got on the guestlist for Encore Beach Club, and I have to say we were all pretty curious about it. Pools, swimsuit-clad partiers, alcohol, and great music... what's not to like? It's somewhere you gotta try at least once in Vegas.Restaurant review
In my quest to find good BBQ in Champaign outside of BlackDog which I still have not had a chance to eat at due to the long lines, I ended up at Bobo's with carry out. First the food takes a bit of time to prepare even though I was only 1 of 2 customers. I took heed to avoid the mac and cheese as it was reported to be similar to box mac and cheese. My sides were fries which are skin on potato fries, good not very crunchy but tasty and the potato salad which tasted like run of the mill potato salad. The corn bread was crumbly and dry so not so good. And on to the meats, pulled pork and beef brisket. There was not really any strong smoky flavor. The portion size was ridiculously small. For 13 dollars you can see how much food I got in the container. The only redeeming value was the delicious BBQ sauce. The chiptole peach and mild sauce were amazing BBQ sauce with a delicate balance of spiciness and sweetness. The only downside is you get only 2 small containers for the sauce. If you want any more you have to pay extra.

Pros: Amazing selection of BBQ sauce

Cons: Small portion size, expensive, not really good smoky flavors

Hidden deals:
Lunch specials Monday to Friday with main entree, side, and drinks for some ranging from 7-8 dollarsHad lunch at this place, disappointed, ordered fish and chip combo , chip over cooked, fish is dry and bitter.... waste time and appetiteI feel this place needs some serious managing lets start with the disgusting dirty men's room nothing like fresh urine on the toilet seat and the complete lack of supplies. The lack of cleanliness follows to the seating area it was not very busy but none of the tables had been cleaned er I mean cleared the table washing takes on a whole new meaning of disgust I do not like my table to be wiped with a reisty rag after wiping shart laden seats yea the meal arrives Caesar salad child's portion but who cares who wants wilted old salad other dish had a complete lack of Alfredo sauce on the cold pasta and onto the char broiled chicken ptarmigan well done on the charring enter the pimple laden manager appointee who was not told not to argue with the customer and defend the poor quality of food with a I'm sure it was done right if you want an episode of disgust hurry to Via Cibo and I hope you are not disapointed if the place is clean and food resembles something edibleI've eaten here before and had the steak which is really good. This visit, I had the prime rib since I was trying for something different and the server said it was what they were known for. The prime rib was really good and so was the grilled veggies and baked potato it came with. The food here is pretty good and consistent but I gave it 3 stars because, well, it's a steakhouse and there isn't anything here you can't get at other similar steakhouses. Would I dine here again? Yes, but I like to try new things so it wouldn't necessarily be a first choice.Stopped in here a few weeks ago with visiting family for lunch. Had an awesome California chopped salad ! Service was great , everyone was happy! I've been back twice, nice to find a local spot you can depend on.Great food and great service!! Really good value. Shared the platter for two. Recvomend the brussels sprouts!Tried this place again and was fairly satisfied. Had the ribs, very good, and half a chicken good also.Most of their stuff is dry rubbed so you shouldn't need a sauce but they offer a mustard and red sauce for some of the other stuff. I wasn't a fan of either one but not a game changer. The coleslaw was a big disappointment. Chopped cabbage but no "creamy " sauce at all. Just the cabbage. The neighbor hood is giving them a hard time about noise and smoke smell but It doesn't seem to be a big issue to most of the area. I hope they survive. We need a place like this on Williamson Street.Who doesn't know about Panda Express?  I have to admit: I first patronized this place because of the cute panda mascot.  Now, I find myself searching for PE when I want a quick Asian-style hit.  It is what it is and sometimes the food could be fresher.  BUT, if you know what you're getting and not expecting 5* authentic Chinese cuisine, then you'll probably be happy.When a company has 4 stars and I can order delivery through Yelp, I don't hesitate.  I should have.  It took over 2 hours to receive my order... :(.  It was a special night ... We were treating family.  After one hour I called the restaurant and was told he had just left with our order.  Thirty minutes later, still no food.  Called again and was informed he had 3 orders to deliver.  I was assured he had special bags and my food would be warm.  Another 30 (total time over 2 hours) he arrives!  I politely ask if my calamari will be soggy he replies smiling "yes, yes" clearly he has no idea what I said.  Sure enough the food is cold, soggy, and gross.  Not enjoyable at all!!!  $100 wasted.  I'll never order from here again.  

We got, calamari, pot stickers, sweet sour chicken(not bad... If it was hot), duck curry ( not good ), and pad Thai (I've had much better).

Ok the bright side, kids were so starving they ate the soggy calamari!Not bad for a vegetarian restaurant. The food is fresh, creative, and inspiring. It's not easy to replicate sushi or duck\/pork using soy, but they pull it off in a fresh and tasty way.We ate at Brasa on Friday night with a Groupon. I had been wanting to try Brasa for awhile. I expected a much more impressive presentation for the price. The salad bar has a decent selection, but nothing special. Besides the salad bar you can opt to get meet delivered to your plate by waiters walking around with meat on a stick that they cut right onto your plate. There are sixteen different types of meat to choose from. Not all of the meat was cooked properly however. Some seemed overcooked and some were definitely undercooked. My wife is a picky eater and it definitely isn't a place for the picky. The servers don't offer much of a description of each meat and they don't stop coming if you have your coater flipped over indicating you'd like meat. Our main waiter had a serious attitude and made a very mean comment about the hostess after she say us. Even with the groupon we felt like we got taken for a ride.We were here last Saturday for AZ Restaurant Week. We had a 6pm reservation and noticed the parking lot was FULL. They told our friends behind us that valet was full\/closed, until they mentioned they had a dinner reservation, and then space miraculously opened. Note that street parking is by permit only, so valet is your only option.

Little Cleo's was pretty small and, disappointingly, didn't have any patio seating. It also appears to appeal more to an older crowd (or maybe we just ate at "older crowd" eating time!). But it was cool inside, a bit retro.

We started with shrimp and oysters. All amazing. Hubby had the best frog legs we've ever eaten, with a Thai chili sauce. I had the grilled octopus, which I would pass on. Hubby had fish and chips, saying the fish was really good. I had the mussels and squid ink pasta (again, just ok). For dessert hubby got the beignets, which were fluffy little pillows from heaven. They were amazing. I had the buttermilk tart, which needed a tad more fruit but was yummy.

So why the five stars if my food was only good? Well, first, I had three impeccable cocktails, at just $8 each. Second, our server was AMAZING. I mean, really, really good. She coursed the meal perfectly, checked in when appropriate, we wanted for nothing... She really made the experience perfect. It was a great atmosphere and a tremendous value, so they get 5 stars from me!My favorite thing to order here is the orange chicken combo. The chicken is cooked to perfection . And the food service is wonder full. Workers ask me if everything is okay and if I need anything else. They have various types of drinks and you can add boba to any drink on the list. I really do recommend this place.Looking for a casual spot to have a great glass of wine and a terrific meal?  Then look no further than Bar North.

Oh sure- you can go to the fancier North restaurant next door, but why?  The menus are the same, you have the same great choices of wine and the stellar service abounds.  So with our group the other night- we took over the bar side of this restaurant in Kierland Commons and they took great care of us!

Chris, our server, was outstanding!  My glass was never empty- he took the time to make us feel so welcome and he was quick with a quip (which I love!)  And imagine my surprise when I found out he had only been with Bar North for about two months . . .I would have thought, given his comfort with his role, that he had been there much longer!  But who cares?:  He really took our night from just another night out to a great night out and for that he deserves a shout out!

We started with some chacuterie and bread along with some type of stacked sandwiches.  For our entrees we had a couple of their thin crust pizzas as well as two of their signature pasta dishes.  All were quite good.  And for dessert? Tiramasu which almost had us licking the jar it came in.

Bar North is located in the Kierland Commons mall so parking is plentiful.  I also liked that it opens onto to a common patio which would be great for people watching on a warmer day (it was cold when we were there).  And the decor is contemporary and understated with candles twinkling in the windows only to be matched by the crystals dangling from the exposed bulbs in the center of the room.

All in all a really great choice for a fun dinner out!- Mac & Cheese was what you expect from a Fast Food restaurant. 
- The ground beef in the Dirty Rice was a little burned.  There was  too much salt or too many spices, I couldn't finish it.  
- The same was true with the 2Pc meal I ordered.  I had to remove the skin (cooking oil dripping from it) to get pass the salt or spices.  
- But the Mountain Dew was great ;-)IGreat place to hang out have a beer and a delicious hot dog not to mention tater tots.the hotdog was everything I expected. 

It was there going to delicious toasted Hawaiian buns with bacon red peppers caramelized onions question me to jalapenos topped with Mayo ketchup and mustard. 

The meat was cooked to perfection and presentation was amazing. We both had a nice cold beer what are hot dogs. Friendly customer service even when our cashier left for the day she made sure to call and let him know you didn't give us happy hour. Which got us two more beers.
The AC was broken and it was pretty warm but non the less we loved this place and will return soon for some yummy grub!Great Location! Quick lunch! Love the slaw burger with cheddar fries. Looking to change it up order the pulled pork with parmesan chips. Great selection of beers. 
Everything is SO full of flavor. Staff is very friendly and happy to serve you a burger and beer! Favorite lunch spot! Craving a burger stop in and try it.Came here for after dinner drinks on Saturday evening of the Labour Day weekend. We were just walking along St. Paul when we happened upon a sign directing us to the best view of Old Montreal. A series of signs led us to a back door of Taverne Gaspar and through to the lobby of the Auberge du Vieux Port. A short elevator ride later and we found ourselves on the rooftop terrasse, where we were treated to a stunning panoramic view of Old Montreal and the St. Lawrence while we sipped on our (predictably overpriced) drinks. Price-aside though, the drinks (we ordered several of the sangrias) were excellent. My favourite was the bubbly sangria  (mousseux, Pineau des Charentes, white cranberry juice), which was unique, strong, and beautifully presented.

Bottom line: An awesome place to spend a evening with friends.Had donuts and croissants from here for my daughters bridal shower. Excellent in tast, texture and price. ThanksThe best place for pho in Cleveland - and I have tried all of them. The awards on the wall seem to agree with me. It tastes better and is also slightly cheaper than Number 1 Pho nearby, which I don't quite understand. Since I come here only when I have the craving for pho, I haven't ordered anything else besides the appetizers and banh mi sandwiches despite coming here for years.

There is a generous amount of beef, and the broth is clear and tasty without being overly salty. There is no post-MSG-consumption headache here, which I really appreciate. You are given a large plate of possible condiments including basil, chili pepper, bean sprouts, and lime. I generally add in all of the bean sprouts (it gives me the warm fuzzy feeling that I am actually having a healthy meal), as well as the basil and chili pepper. I do not use the sweet plum sauce nor the sriracha, but if you want to, it is probably best to squeeze it out onto the plate and dip the meat into it. I have seen some people put it into the soup directly, but that seems like it would distort the taste of the broth.

This place is actually pretty busy during peak hours, but I have never actually had to wait for a seat. The pho comes out almost immediately after you order it (in fact the appetizer usually takes longer), and you pay at the counter up front prior to leaving. Service is efficient and polite. The décor is quite plain and unassuming, but this is definitely one of those places where you're paying for the food, and personally I tend not to notice when I am too busy inhaling the noodles.Cheap price to begin with and the kids were STILL discounted! Nothing to complain about. There is an acceptable variety of items for a reasonable price. The staff was friendly and kept up our table and drinks exceptionally well.The food is awesome the service not so great.  The Greek salads with pita and grilled chicken are above par as is the gyros.  Great baklava too.We brought our cousin that was visiting from US. We ordered the sweet chili fries, fries chaat and trio of chicken as apps. Hubby and cousin loved the chicken and fries were enjoyed by all. Suggest to serve onions with the chicken.
For dinner I had a gf dairy free spinach quesadilla. Spicy and kind of dry but I did not want a heavier meal.
Cousin and hubby shared the palak paneer, lamb and plain naan and garlic naan. They loved the food but found the naan dry. The server said they use a tandoor but maybe they need to add more butter.
For dessert they had the paan kulfi and loved it. I suggest they make it with coconut milk as they make it in house.....then I could have it next timeStaff were friendly and helpful.


We were at the Streetsville Christmas market and Amantra had some food set up outside that could be purchased. A meal of 2 items and rice was $9.99. I ordered the channa masala and dal makhani to go as it was starting to rain. By the time I got to the car, the dal had come out of the container into the bag. At home I transferred it to a plate and warmed it up in the microwave. It was on the spicy side but was not bad.
We had eaten in the restaurant in the past and that was a better experience. My kids and I love their fusion fries (chaat fries and sweet chili fries). We all thought their main dishes (butter chicken and channa, were just average.
The staff are very nice and informative and I hope they do well in this location.....they just need to make their main dishes as good as their apps.We had supper here before a performance at the Phoenix Theatre. We enjoyed a happy hour drink of the day before moving to the dining room. 

The server was very helpful helping us choose items from the tapas menu. In addition we ordered two entrees. 

The restaurant was clean and inviting. The staff was friendly and courteous. Since the theatre does not usually have dining options in the evening, this is a great choice!After school was over my friends and I came here and the food was amazing. The employees were very generous and had offered us specials for us the next time we see them. Definitely eating here again.First time trying this restaurant. I thought the spaghetti and meatballs was pretty good. We stopped in to order takeout and the service was fast and courteous. Looking forward to trying more from their menu.Just called for a pick up order, the young lady who answered the phone informed me everything I wanted to order from the menu doesn't actually exist. SMH I didn't order anythingThis place is for dudes.  
In the nicest way, I am not into cars, bikes, wings, or sports as much as the rest of you are, and that's just fine by me.  
Every time I have visited Quaker Steak and Lube, the men in my life find this place exciting; the memorabilia, the menu, the WINGS, the beer, the sauce list....  So if you're looking to take your boyfriend or hubby out for somewhere he'll like, then take him here.
I've been for lunch, dinner, and bike night (Wednesday).  There's guys in jeans, dress pants, leather chaps and they all get into this place like no girl will.
Wings, boneless wings, breaded wings, grilled boneless wings, saucy wings, tangy wings, thai spicy wings, bbq sweet wings, buckets of wings and wingy wings.  We had an amazing burger, something southwestern sounding with jalapeno's, slaw, black beans, cheddar cheese and sour cream.  The waiter said it was his favorite and my hubby agrees he'll be back for another one. 

Outside patio is nice but the smokers catch me off guard every time.

Bike night is an interesting event, good live bands, lots of chrome, leather, and excellent people watching.  Don't expect to be seated or get your food right away if you're there in the midst of the event.  We waited for over 45 minutes for our food.  Hang out, drink a beer and take it all in.Food:  3.5\/5

On the several occasions I've been at Eggspectation, I haven't been able to try a variety of their breakfast foods for this reason: their Southwest omelette has been so good that I order it every time I visit!

With fresh ripe avocado and salsa on top of my well cooked omelette, I am eager for my next bite even before I finished the one in my mouth. The hash potatoes that accompany the omelette are very addicting, and I end up finishing all of them even though I'm very full from my omelette.

My husband usually goes for their benedicts, and the smoked salmon is one of his favourites. Served on whole wheat toast, it's definitely going to fill you up for the rest of your day. We find that the portions are quite huge and sort of difficult to finish; we end up almost always leaving the fruit untouched, or barely touched that is because we are so full.

The rest of the drinks are alright - they always have condiments and other things always fully stocked and they are quick to get you anything that you need if not present. The coffee and tea that we always order in the morning are average but will give you the kick of caffeine that you need in the morning. As for the service, we've had good and average service when we've been; Eggspectation has always been really full of customers and so very busy! They really need to hire more servers during the busy morning hours...

Anyway, if you're new in town, Eggspectation should be tried at least once! It's a great place to start your day whether you're here for business or for leisure, or even if you live in the city! The restaurant is located all around eastern Canada and USA, so find your closest location on their website and try the Southwest omelette!This is one of my favorite restaurants!  Everything on the menu is great.  My favorites include the baguette and baked goat cheese to start, the french onion burger, and pork chile verde.  

The ambiance is second to none.  Modern landscaping invites you in.  There's an inside\/outside bar with seats on the inside on one side and on the other side on the outside patio.  The patio wraps around and provides an intimate, relaxed dining experience.  The inside is more vibrant, with loud music playing (but not so loud that you can't have a conversation).  I also hear they have a great Sunday brunch with a jazz trio for entertainment.  It's a great spot if you're in Central Phoenix.My Mother and I went for breakfast on Sunday Morning.  The wait was a little long, but we were understanding because of the timing.  Then we were seated 20 mins after and arrival, and the waitress seemed very disinterested. Despite this we were hopeful, because we've been here before, but then we waited 1 hour for our food. We asked the waitress why the food was taking so long, and were response nasty and disrespectful. The manager came by (still have not received any food) who also didn't have reason as to why our food took an hour.  He came back to our table 5 mins later with our food, and the tickets from the kitchen of other tables who had to wait 45 mins for food.(Just to clarify these are the tickets given to the cooks to keep track of orders). I then let the manager know the food he brought us was incorrect, and the manager said "What more do you want now", and accused me of lying about the food being incorrect. At this point I was fed up, but he went back into the kitchen to make sure I wasn't lying to him. It was one of the restaurant experiences ever, and we left hungry with no food.I must say not very impressive first impression. To sum up the experience, 40-min wait to get seated , 40-min wait for the food arrival, 15-min to finish the food. I guess we waited so long and we devoured the meal like beasts!!! Weird part was the place wasn't packed when we were there for a Sunday brunch; but I don't think the kitchen could keep up with the orders. There were empty tables inside but they were just not taking ppl in. Beastwich was good but very heavy, made us wanna be on salad for the rest of the day; French toast with duck was just so so, very little duck for my taste. 

With all being said, it is still a neat place to check out. Will I return again? Sure after I fully digested the beastwich and if the line isn't too bad.I can't say enough great things about this place! No matter what you order you will not be disappointed. They have the best falafel in the whole valley and the hummus is to die for! The staff is very friendly and they let you know you are appreciated for your patronage. When you're on Mill Avenue it is a must have experience!Great food, every time we've gone whether it's breakfast, lunch or dinner it's been great. The Belgian waffle is the best ever! And the salmon dinner is perfect.Food ;
I came here a few weeks ago with my boyfriend, and we ordered a Teriyaki Burger with Extra Teriyaki Sauce on the side, ( thanks to my aunts recommendation ) it was like Heaven In a burger, It was so great! The Onions were well cooked and The bun was very toasty. We both Loved it!

Service: 
ALRIGHT the service was PRETTY GREAT, me and my boyfriend wasn't able to get his name but he was Employee Number 5, He was Super nice! great customer service too! 

i Highly recommend eating here when you go to galleria mall, it's super great and fulfilling.Wish I would have consulted Yelp before dining here... 

I'm new to the area, and drive past this place quite often, and thought I'd give their Sunday brunch a try. Big mistake. The food was awful. With the exception of the salad bar and fresh fruit, everything tasted and looked like it had been previously frozen or canned. 

Simply put - I've had continental breakfasts at the Holiday Inn that were better.

Our waiter was a nice guy. Very pleasant. Too bad the food wasn't.Wow if I could give this place a big fat 0 I would. HORRIBLE. They were out of some of the bread for their sandwiches. Imagine a bakery that is out of bread. We also ordered their featured seasonal soup. Guess what? They were out of it.  Food not worth the price. Don't go.Excellent food jam is awesome! Our server alissa  was great! We will be back. place is clean!Melt is the place that I take anyone who comes into the Cleveland area who I think will like something that is just really off the wall and comforting all at the same time.  The food is fantastic - I have never had anything bad here.  If it is on the menu, you will eat it and enjoy it....  

(place comment about wait for seats here) - While it was not the owners fault that he created a great restaurant, this is a problem.  I would not mind the wait so much if not for one thing - if you are hanging out after you finish your meal, and you see that about 40 parties are waiting to eat, get the f up from the table and go somewhere else to have a drink after you eat.  Melt has a bar area to drink at - drink there....

Okay, now that I got that off my chest, to summarize the review.  Yeah. Good place....Try to get there early.  If you eat there, respect the fact that other people want to eat too.Absolutely disgusted that your chandler location thought that serving this is ok. I called back up there and spoke with the manager and he asked me verbatim "what do you want me to do?" He didn't even apologize. I can't believe this is going on! Your cooks need to be checking the temperature of the food before serving this!Strangest hot and sour soup I have ever had anywhere in the World. Sent it back. Pho broth tasted like.Chinese 5 spice. Never have figured out the use for this spice but it ain't for Pho. Vietnamese egg rolls terrible 
 Too bad they prey on old people's lack of taste buds.This place cost $10 for dinner and they have the same beef steak as The Buffet. They don't have everything like the king crab legs and desserts but it pretty good for the price. Lots of Canadian French in the summer. Margarita taste pretty good. Get free comp when you gamble. Pasta is ok. I tasted it once with shrimp and never tasted it again. Soups are good. Salad bar is good too.While visiting a friend in Phoenix during Thanksgiving week, my dining companion and I sought out Over Easy.  I love me my breakfasts and I've heard they are exceptionally good.  Note:  This was on a Tuesday.

I had the Chicken Fried Steak.  The breading was crispy and flavorful ... it tasted just like the well-seasoned breading on a piece of fried chicken.  On top of it was a dollop of white gravy.  I liked that it was not smothered in gravy as you see on so many chicken fried steaks you might get elsewhere.  And on top of that were my over-easy eggs, accompanied by the home fries on the side.

My dining companion had the Brioche French Toast with caramelized bananas.  It was good, but when he tasted my Chicken Fried steak, he ordered one for himself and we shared the remaining French Toast between us.

Now, this is where things get weird.  I was so enamored with the Chicken Fried Steak, we went back the next day (a Wednesday) and brought our host, a Phoenix resident, with us.  I ordered the Chicken Fried Steak again as did our host.  My companion tried the Fried Chicken & Waffles.

To my surprise and disappointment, this time the breading was not crisp at all.  It was kind of mushy.  And the flavor?  There was none.  It was bland and lacked seasoning.  It was like day and night.

However, in both instances, the service was friendly and prompt.  

I'm still giving this place 4 stars based on my first experience.  I'm hoping that they just had a bad day on Wednesday.I love the VIG!  Situated in a part of town where you wouldn't necessarily think a cool, hip little bar would be found, but sure enough it's there.

They have a decent selection of beers, both bottles and on tap.  They have Stella so they automatically win me over in the beer department.  Other drinks I have had have been very drinkable.

Their food is not half bad either.  On the last trip I had the spinach-artichoke dip.  Wasn't too bad, but not impressive either.  Prior to that I had the carne asada on top of a potato latka.  Wow!  It was good.  i was mad at the Vig for a little because they got rid of the pork nachos, but have since forgiven them.

The atmosphere either inside or out on the patio is always great.  It can get loud, but its not church, right?  They have a suitable amount of heaters and fires going for colder nights and almost always enough seating.  I had never played bocce ball before coming here and had a blast playing slightly (read: VERY) flavored.  I also enjoy the Trivial Pursuit questions on the tables.  It allows me to actually use all of the useless information stored in my head.

Overall a cool place where it doesn't matter what you're wearing or who you are seen with.I love Bobby Q. I have officially been to all three locations here in the valley. I'll have to say both the biltmore and north Phoenix locations are my favorite. I feel like the Mesa location is not up to par like the others. I always split the full rack of baby back ribs. They are delicious and fall right off the bone! I also love their Mac and cheese!Please Close this hotlel down !!! BioHazard Dirty towel inside
 I got their room from prIceline for name ur price for 45 dollar for 3 Star hotel though i got  a deal, OMG i was wrong they only charge u 24 the night. got there at 1pm they told me the room has not been clean yet and told me tcomatose back in 2 hr. got back there at 330pm and then told me the check in time star at 5pm..... came back at 5 and then told only smoking left argued for 1\/2 hour and got upgrade. Boy was that a fun day at Las Vages. The hall way smell like dead fish. got to the room the towel have hair on it. called the front desk ask for a new set of towel, no one come , I have to walk back and front desk to get new towel and it wasted half an hour. I don't even have time to have dinner and need to go watch KA in MGM. Come back no parking space and need park at their satellite parking space located 20 minutes walk from the hotel. I'm they ruined whole day felt angry complained and no use them don't give, and want me to leave !!! wow Please Please don't come to this Bioharzard hotelStill our favorite italian for 8 years running.  Owners make the experience over the top as we feel like family.  Great value and food is hands down better than any italian in the vegas area.  Favorites are garlic cheesy knots, Sicilian pizza, BBQ chicken pizza, pinwheels, stromboli, and chicken parmesean.[2nd time take-out]

Have spaghetti curry chicken, same burger curry, satay chicken skewers, and roti.

The spaghetti was a bit.. gooey \/ burned.. the curry sauce was too liquid that bottom of the dish looks almost like soup-base. Given it's "fusion" thai-version spaghetti, fine.. But the herbs\/leave\/whatever-dark-green-black-looking thing mixed in the spaghetti, not only it tasted awful (i think it's rotten, they just didn't pick it out), the flavor was overwhelming.. Overall, the dish tasted neither spaghetti nor curry :((

The burger curry.. sigh.. the patty just tested weird.. perhaps expired. I don't know what meat or source it is from. But.. it taste like a frozen patty that has been sitting in my freezer for 3 years, now I finally remember to cook it.

On the upside, roti was good as expected :)

Satay chicken tasted the same as last time, I really like their peanut sauce.I really thoroughly loved their Caesar. It came with each flavoured Doritos and little gherkins on a toothpick\/mini skewer. The rim did not make me want to ditch the straw but the contents were delish. I chugged each one up to prevent melting ice to ruin the flavour. This drink will be all I return for though. My daughter was disappointed with their Federal Eggs (their interpretation of eggs Benny) and I was disappointed by their cobb salad and side of Rosti potatoes. The salad was bland and undressed or the dressing was super bland. The portion of greens to everything else left u with too much greens to enjoy it as a cobb salad should be enjoyed. The Rosti potatoes were saved by the delicious ketchup (made in house it seems) and awesome hit sauce. Will be back for drinks but bit worth the wait for brunch.I was really disappointed in the food selection and quality here. I decided to check this place out with high hopes that FINALLY there would be a decent Mexican restaurant in the area.. well I was certainly let down. The menu is tiny with very generic selections and the tacos are nothing to write home about. You pay PER taco (some of them are as much as $7 each) and they are bland and extremely lacking. I have made better tacos for a quarter of the price in my own kitchen. I would avoid coming here, buy some ground beef or chicken and some taco seasoning and make your own tacos. I guarantee they will be better than the ones they serve here. 
Also, their chips and queso was gross. The tortilla chips were soaked with oil and the queso tasted like the kind you buy in a jar at Target.Gets better every time! The service is always so genuine and we are always impressed! I highly recommend trying the top sirloin, the garlic filet, and the lamb chop (with the mint jelly). My only reason for not giving a 5 star is the hostesses could be more engaging upon arrival and when exiting....we will be back!Was really excited to finally give this club a try but was extremely disappointed! First of all, it didn't seem like they were enforcing the dress code... some of the outfits that people were wearing were not something that I thought they would allow in. Second, it was really really crowded. The dance floor itself is quite small, but I kind of expected that. Third (& most importantly), the Dj sucked ! We came here on 11\/9\/17 & the Dj was all over the place with his music choices. He would play something good (for about 30 secs) and then switch it up to something completely different, it was so annoying! The music is what really ruined the experience for us. Definitely will not be returning or recommending this club.Excellent location overlooking the lake! Beautifully decorated. Staff was very attentive, but not annoying. I had the apple salad which was truly delicious. The bread basket was generous with crusty French bread. I also had the salmon which was done to perfection. Great flavor, nice sized portion. Finished off with coconut sorbet, housemade and delicious. The Malbec wine was a great compliment as well.  Highly recommend!!Great food and great service. Will definitely come here on a regular basis.Excellent beef with pepper and onions. Waiter made a good wine choice. Fastest food delivery, less than 5 minutes, honest. Both meals less than $30, in and out in 45 minutes.First time there.   It was a holiday and I needed a quick bite and they were the only place open.  So I tried the chopped salad with grilled chicken.  It was "A"wful   The chicken was cubed cold and old. I was hungry so I ate it.  It didn't take long for my stomach to tie up in knots.   I'm sill sick ... Just stay away.Let me start by saying, I love Panera Bread. I enjoy the food. The customer service is generally some of the best in fast food service. The new delivery service makes it super convenient to get my fix at work. All that being said, this location makes me not want to eat there ever again. Every single delivery order we have placed with them has been incorrect. You can't call them 11a-2p. So, when they screw the order up you then have to drive there to correct it. They also don't bother to follow special instructions. Now, their ordering website is down "for maintenance." Instead of accommodating their customers by taking lunch orders via phone until the site is back online, their manager's answer is to tell people they can't take orders via phone and to wait "about an hour" for the website to be operational again. That is an atrocious answer and terrible customer service. Not to mention, that is going to cause a huge amount of orders to be placed at one time and the delivery times to skyrocket. So, we won't be able to place orders until almost noon and eat until 1pm or later. No, just no. This is a very busy location and its clear they aren't able to handle the volume. They need to get their sh*t together. I called the next closest location and placed my order via phone with no issues.Fiddler's Green is a nice place with uncomfortable furniture and great food with huge portions.  One of my companions got the chicken pot pie and a side of mac & cheese.  Despite the waiter's warnings, he persisted on ordering a disgusting quantity of food.  It tasted so good, that he finished it all.

Fiddler's Green has a good drink selection with friendly servers who are not afraid to tell you what they think about your drink order.  You may get teased if you are a man who orders the "Dr. Pepper".

In addition to the good food and service, there is some interesting scenery.  Our table was adjacent to an alley where we saw an old woman with a can of Budweiser urinating behind a couch.  Very entertaining!After looking for a nice, quaint little coffee shop to hang out and reading the great reviews, I decided to give this place a try. I am proud to say I am now an owner of their loyalty punch card program because I have become a loyal customer. The place has great coffee, but equally as important, they have owners that appreciate their customers. I love supporting small, local business and this place is worthy of its praise!Appetizers are great, amazing caesar salad & shrimp cocktail, drinks are great, but we had a 20 person dinner with a variety of main dishes orders and it was all mediocre at bestTypically we'd rate Yutaka as a solid 4 in food and a 5 in service but tonight we noticed how things are changing not for the better. Sushi was fine but the grilled saba and karage were disappointing, in particular the karage which was dry. Service was slow and not very attentive  - it was obvious there was more effort in clearing the tables so they could get out earlier. And little details are starting to show..things like a very loose door handle to the mens washroom.  Also its probably time to refresh the menu...daily specials aren't special if they're always on, and if you're no longer offering things on the regular menu, then it should be removed (eg daikon salad). Hope we're wrong and it was just an off night and as regulars hope they sort things out.I have tried this take out on different occasion under new ownership and still does not come up to my standard of fish and chips , the main problem with to me as well is the cleanliness , of the place I know its been there for à long time but still nothing to do with keeping the place clean ,has for the food i find there is too much batter not enough fish , and there chips too soggyI haven't gone to Carmines for over a year but it use to be one if my favorite Italian places.  Loved the shrimp on the stone and the chicken Marsala.  The shrimp pizza, caesar salad, and many other dishes there were also great.  Their kitchen opens 24\/7The service was okay along with the food. We'll take that drive to Scottsdale for the quality of the meats at Fogo De Chao.J'y suis, j'y reviens! Chouette caffé pas loin du parc La Fontaine. Ambiance cozy, il y fait bon, la musique est calme, bref tout ce que j'aime. Le service est nickel et la nourriture est vraiment bonne. Je ne suis pas déçue :DOn an evening where basically every other restaurant was packed full (aka Valentine's Day), Customshop was one of basically no restaurants with reservations left.  Me, being semi-anal about having actual reservations before going anywhere that is going to be packed, plucked the last available spot on OpenTable.  

The restaurant itself is conveniently located in Elizabeth (close enough to Uptown) along a street with many other popular restaurants such as Carpe Diem and Passion8.  The lighting is pretty dim, but it matches the atmosphere of the restaurant, which isn't too loud or too quiet, but just right... maybe because the entire restaurant was of couples? We were seated closely to another table, but didn't have to listen to their conversation the whole night.  Our server, Zoe, was an absolutely delight and was super friendly to us the whole evening.  The drinks took a little long to arrive, but it may have been because it was a full house... so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.

As for food, we chose to order a bunch of small plates and one main entree:
- Tuna crudo - slightly different texture than what I'm used to, but the flavor was okay.  Could have been a bit more tangy
- Beef carpaccio - holy moly this was the motherlode of all beef carpaccios.  It's a LOT for two people.  
- Razor clams - best flavor of the night, but some of them were a little overcooked and very chewy
- Pork belly - could have been a little more melt-in-your-mouth and was rather bland
- BBQ octopus - I was a little apprehensive about ordering BBQ anything, but this actually turned out to be the best dish of the evening.  I liked that it had a little kick to it and was more flavorful than the other dishes
- Smoked duck - cooked just right... loved the crispy skin.

Overall, the food was a bit lackluster in that many of the dishes simply were not flavorful, salty enough, or just quite bland.

BUT... for dessert, I ordered the brownie souffle with coffee ice cream and that solved all my issues for the night. The souffle was the perfect amount of chocolate - not too rich, and just melty enough.  The cold ice cream and the melty goodness of the souffle complemented each other so well. I ate the entire thing by myself, thanks to my dinner companion that evening, and have zero regrets!

Excellent service and atmosphere, blandish food, but amazing dessert.  Prices were reasonable.Nice sports bar to hang out at. They have a huge selection of beers, and the food is tasty, with some trendy unconventional options. Some of the booths have personal tvs, so you can switch it to whatever game or fight you're interested in.  They have pool tables,  a little bowling alley,  cornhole, and a giant jenga to play with too.Very mediocre BBQ served here. Service was fast and friendly though. But if you're looking for "finger-lickin'-good" BBQ in Charlotte this is not the place. I still gave 3 stars as again, the service staff here was very friendly.Very nice place to have dinner when you are in North Scottsdale. Service and people are great in the food is outstanding. Try when you're in the areaI've been to the sweet poke at the centennial hills location and really enjoy their bowls. The sweet Maryland location I feel is even better. They give you a student discount, and is more generous with the toppings.

I try to be healthy so I always get my bowl with half tofu half spinach. The combo is delicious because the poke sauce coats it and it feels so much lighter than eating rice. The sauce combo I do is the spicy mayo, sesame shoyu, and spicy garlic ponzu. I like the sweet and spicy balance. 

The workers there are nice and are generous with the toppings. I load mine with tons of veggies including avocado, cucumbers, bell peppers and seaweed salad. Also try adding fried onion or garlic chips to your bowl. Adds great flavor and texture!  They also have a bonus reward program. If you buy 10 bowls or burritos you get one free!Inexperienced service, slow, unorganized. The food comes out in odd orders and it may be a spread of 45 minutes before all of your food gets to you. They always say they are working on getting parking compped for the garage but that has been the case ever since they've opened.  There's no team work in their service and our servers hardly ever comes around. 

If you're like me and fell in love with this restaurant in Vegas, you'll be disappointed by your experience here in Tempe.With prices slightly higher than the average AYCE sushi restaurant, I expected the quality to be higher as well. That very well was not the case. 

We were seated near the door and all night, a gust of cold wind would interrupt our dinner, so I put my jacket back on. 

Some of the things that stood out from their menu: scallop sashimi (diced to small pieces) and steamed egg. The sashimi, especially the salmon, was sliced in such chunky pieces I felt like I was eating a raw piece of salmon filet instead of sashimi. 

The sushi pieces were soggy and warm, not to mention they also fell apart easily. It didn't matter what we ordered, the presentation and size of the sushi was just so unappetizing. 

I enjoyed the steam egg and their beef ribs are quite good, however, we had to eat through conversations between the servers in Mandarin about how this one table is still ordering and complained about them openly. When half your customers are Asian, I really don't suggest this type of behaviour.. 

Either way, I don't  know if I'll be back here.Holy Korean bbq!!! This place is great for eats, drinks, and grilling. Different style of buffet...Great pho, great place, great service. Definitely recommend this play. The other places on Eastern aren't bad but this is my fav so far.Got food poisoning from here. Won't happen again.

I got a quick and concerning response from Hussong's shortly after I posted this. They are looking into the situation and will be contacting me. First time a company doesn't try and brush it under the table. That makes things a little better.

Everyone else in my party enjoyed their meal, so I guess I'll change my rating.Let's start with what I am not fond of - those hush puppies - hard and no taste. Otherwise, the bbq is very tender and tasty. Ribs were done but not falling apart. Fries are good. I have tried both red and white slaw and like both. Mac & cheese is decent.Great stay at the hotel. The rooms we're awesome value, the pool was awesome, and the staff was great. Bug casino perfect for hanging out. Was actually very disappointed I couldn't smoke my cigar inside the casino or bar. Super lame. They didn't treat cigarette smokers like that. Altogether great spot, decent internet access, great Mexican food restaurant the cantina was very tasty. Easy access to the strip.  Can't wait to come back.It's a good spot for some after bar eats. I thought the soju cocktails were a bit overpriced, but I guess that's how it goes. The chicken was amazing (we got the spicy one, boneless, mix) and some rice cakes and pickled daikon. It's a little different (not authentic Korean though), delicious, and fun to eat.I absolutely love this place.. there is a small amount of AYCE in town that never disappoint and this is definitely one of them. I started coming here few years back, and it wasn't busy and now they are always packed,but still the wait is never too long and customer service is great. The food is absolutely amazing, always fresh and comes out fairly fast. I highly recommend this place.This place is wonderful, the food is fresh and made from scratch, the owner is kind and friendly and the staff is always making sure each guest is having a positive welcoming experience- often they treat their guests with surprise free samples!  ;)Again, another overpriced place, the second they label their business as a healthy store\/restaurant, they think it makes it soooo okay for them to bump up their prices, I got a simple chicken bowl, with veggies and chicken for $12.80!!! Everything is extremely overpriced and they don't give you enough food for the price you pay.This place was just okay. I was hoping for so much more when I saw all the positive reviews online. I had higher hopes when I showed up and saw a line out the door into the parking lot.  I figured it had to be amazing for people to be waiting 15-20 mins that night.

I get in and the flavors were a bit unusual. Normally I do like weird and different but none of the flavors sounded good. I went with the most boring flavor I could find in the end.

For the price I can't say it was mind blowing. Not worth it in my eyes. I'd never go back on my own or suggest it to friends. However, it's not so terrible that I'd refuse to return if my friends wanted to go.  Customer service was friendly and fast. It just wasn't for me as far as flavors go.I went back for lunch and really enjoyed Villa Peru.

It was two of us, and we each ordered an entree ($11 each).  A few dollars more than I'd typically spend for lunch but I was hungry and the entrees just looked tasty.  They also have some panini\/sandwiches which are in my normal lunch price range.

I ordered the Bistec a la Pobre.  The food was really good, from the bread with dipping sauce they start you with to the meal itself.  The portions were good-sized, as I'd expect with an entree.

The waitress was very friendly -- attentive without being pushy.  Our food came out timely.

I'll go again...I'm interested in seeing if I like their sandwiches as much as their entrees.Horrible service. My boyfriend and I seated ourselves and two waiters came to take our drink order. When we began to order out appetizer, the waiter walked away. No one payed attention to us for the most part, despite the fact that it wasn't busy, and we had different waiters and waitresses the entire time. The sushi was good but the yakisoba lacked any taste. Spices don't mesh well with my stomach, so it was either make it bland, or end up throwing up later on. This place needs to step up their service and their food. Will not be back again.Steaks are excellent, had exquisite wine pairings with our 3 course meal.  We thought everything was up to snuff.  The only drawback is the cost but for a once in a while romantic splurging special occasion (and you do only have that amazing anniversary that one time but that creative 29th birthday is over & over & over!!!!!)  
The location is in the Sunset Station Hotel which is ok but if you overindulge you can always do the affordable local special or for out of towners, stay frugally during the week Sun-Thursday.I just tried this ramen place for the first time tonight, and I'm very impressed. The decor is amazing, and I love the fact that this spot is very spacious unlike most ramen places. You don't have to worry about your private conversations as this place gives you plenty of room away from the next table.

I tried the char siu ramen, and it was so good. The base for the soup is amazing and has a great amount of flavor without being too much. What I love most bough is the ramen itself; I love the texture of it and it taste fantastic as well. I added fried tofu to my ramen and it made it even more memorable.

I'm so glad this place is near my house and that I no longer have to drive far whenever I have the craving for ramen. I will definitely recommend this place.Stopped in for lunch to get my fix of dumplings. It is a great sign when you walk in and find a glass wall around the kitchen where they are and assembling dumplings. There are towers of bamboo steamers waiting to be filled with various dumplings and cooked.  We tried several and none of them disappointed. We had the pork and shrimp dumplings, pork soup dumplings and wontons in chili sauce.  I would order each of them again, but preferred the wontons in chili sauce.  I will be creating these. We also tried the green onion pancakes and sticky rice rolls. Everything was great and I would go back.$5 large pizzas at night, who doesn't love that.  And they aren't bad.  But they deliver and are way better than Vocelli's.  I have mostly good experiences when I go.  But once I was there waiting for a take out pizza alone, and some drunk Pitt students were harassing like everyone in the place.  To summarize, good pizza and cheap.Spanish food to me has to be fresh with flavor. I went to Moreno's by chance one day with a group of friends\/family. I ordered 2 small tamales and found myself wanting more so I ordered 2 more tamales and was impressed by the flavors colliding inside my mouth. I've been to their Mesa restaurant and had the same experience when I ordered their chicken tacos and was blown away. Their food is delish and their price very reasonable. Love the atmosphere and their employees are clean and professional. Two thumbs up!Great place! Food is delicious and super cheap - you get great options and it's healthier than most places. What's not to like?! The inside isn't very nice, so I always get it as take-out.Went here for dinner and drinks before attending a show downtown. We arrived about 7ish and ended up staying until 930p. Not for fun mind you - but simply because our service was terrible and we couldn't find anyone to give us our check so we could leave. This is definitely a place to sit at the bar and get service - otherwise best of luck on your server noticing you. We ordered 2 margaritas (not bad but tasted like sweet & sour mix was used), fish & chips, and the flank steak. The food was pretty good, fries were perfect. The sauce that came w\/ the steak was a bit sugary but still a delicious dish. The atmosphere was stylish, dark, divey, and worked well together. The service was very slow. We requested our check three times and didn't get anything until late (very tempted to just walk out). We attempted to order more drinks but the server would disappear and no one else helped us. Later (~20mins) the server returned and told us she had a big table and they had difficult picky orders (which why servers complain about other customers TO customers I don't understand). Food was good, drinks were okay, service was bad.Worst customer service! Server was in a "loud voice" talking to us (feels like she's yelling) We ordered Large soup, grilled pork with rice & a veggie rolls but The server asked us to order more since we were 4 in a table. Eventhough my husband doesn't want to eat! Server still insisted us to order one more. Lastly an insect is roaming around our table while we were eating!! I don't recommend this! Will never come back hereNettes Hotel ca. 10 Min vom Flughafen entfernt. Es gibt einen großen Lobby Bereich mit schönen Sitzmöglichkeiten und Restaurants. Die Zimmer sind schön. 
Leider kostet das Internet, wie in den meisten Hotels dieser Kette, pro 24h Nutzung 10 USD, was ich völlig überflüssig finde. Bei Zimmerpreisen von über 150 USD halte ich das für unangemessen.
Die Lage ist etwas abseits mit wenig Möglichkeiten um das Hotel herum. 
Insgesamt ist der Eindruck aber ok, das Personal ist nett und hilfsbereit.Contracted food poisoning from vegetarian soup. I've never been so sick. Never again!!!!Breathtaking view, dinner was great! Great waiters and staff. Would definitely come again. Only downside is you have to wait an hour for a window seat and you can't reserve in advance.The best BBQ in Madison. Beef brisket is flavorful and ribs are just fantastic. They sell out quick so I just putting in your order early. I hope they get enough business to start making more if everything! Sweet tea is refreshing too :)I have never written a review for yelp, although I use yelp all the time. I had to write in because I eat sushi at least once a week throughout the valley and this a favorite of ours. We demand fresh and it always is. The tuna on wasabi crackers are something I crave in the middle of the night, seriously. It makes me sad that diners haven't enjoyed their experience here because we always do. Friendly, attentive servers each time and I wonder if the people that wrote in with negative comments may just be unfriendly or difficult to please. Always enjoy the 808 roll, sea bass, garlic chicken and short ribs, as well.Okay... YES it's typicially very busy here with a long wait BUT arrived about 5 on Friday & got right in. Arrived Thursday night abt 7 with a 30 min wait BUT found a place at the bar. Service at the bar was prompt & attentive. Friendly bartender. Service at the table admittedly was slow and not nearly as attentive especially during a slower time. 
However, I LOVE the apps here ~ the Sashimi Won-Tacos, Fondue Dippers, and Asian Chicken Wraps are DELICIOUS and perfectly portioned for those who like Ahi & asian inspired foods and unusual apps (fondue dipper). We visited twice just for these dishes. LOVE the ambiance, location, & people watching too.Terrible service at Mandy's DDO today. Lattes took forever to be made. Waited more than 20 minutes. Asked for a refund but the cashier said "it would take me longer to refund you and it is being made" while rolling her eyes. Waited another 5 minutes for the food. Terrible attitude towards customer. Two lattes were brought out in cups and instead of mugs. Macha powder was not mixed at all. Brought the lattes back to the cash and it did take forever to get the refund. ‍Will not go back again for the worst experience ever and the salads are not worth the hype or the price.I was craving some spaghetti and meatballs last night so we decided to try out Brothers italian Bistro delivery and omg it was amazing! We had never been there so we weren't sure the food sizing so we ordered breadsticks and the Mac and cheese bites too. The Mac and cheese bites were delicious!! And the breadsticks were 2.99 for 12 big breadsticks!! Definitely worth the price and will for sure be ordering with them again!!Terrible service from Scott H, super slow for food and drink orders.  Try the bar next time.I said I wanted mild, this is making me sweat. Inedibly salty. Terrible.  Yelp keeps telling me that my message is too short, so I'm going to babble about how much I am not impressed with this place. I won't be going back. I really wanted to keep this short....WOW. I catered a company lunch with B.Good today, and cannot speak highly enough of the entire experience. The customer service that I received (especially from Sean and Karen F.) was stellar, the presentation of the food was beautiful, and the quality and taste was absolutely excellent. From meticulously caring for specific allergy restrictions to bringing along attractive food labels to describe each dish to guests, they did a great job. Coming from someone who has worked in the food industry and now frequently coordinates the catering for company meals, B.Good is definitely on a higher level of quality than most. I also love that they make good quality, healthy food look and taste so delicious. 
We ordered the burger and chicken sliders, which were accompanied with smashed avocado, BBQ sauce, sauteed mushrooms and other typical condiments. The whole wheat buns were fresh, the meat cooked very nicely, and the size quite large for sliders. The kale power salad was also totally delicious. Great job all around! I look forward to dropping by the store for lunch some time soon.I'm basically a regular now. Well, when I can afford to spend any money (college student here). 

Anyways, I have a sensitive stomach. So greasy and heavy foods are basically poison. I'll eat them but I can't eat for several hours afterwords because it feels like a rock in my stomach. This place leaves me feeling full, but fresh. Love it. It's clear all of their foods are made with fresh ingredients. Little to no grease from what I order (pomegranate chicken gyro platter and hummus appetizer). Their salads are awesome, portions are good. And I cannot get pomegranate chicken anywhere else lol. I'm slightly addicted. 
The service is ALWAYS friendly btw. I have been there numerous times in different times of the day and they are always very nice and attentive to me. Their ice tea tastes so fresh too! Pretty sure it's brewed. Too good to come from syrup. 
I also work in fast food and I'm constantly trying to spot anything dirty (force of habit), but this place is always clean. 
I would definitely recommend this place. 
And for the specialized dieters, they have vegetarian, vegan, and gluten free options as well!!!!!Needs real meatballs on the pizza but other than that this is a solid pie! get it well doneI've had this placed bookmarked after a few visits to Vegas.  I finally decided to check it out.  I had ordered the (Carne Asada) Nachos which were pretty good but my wife had ordered the Shrimp Ceviche and tostada.  I seriously don't recall when the last time I had a Ceviche this good.  I miss this place already and it's only been 3 days since my visit.  I can't wait to go back and try out the Carnitas.Pizza was bomb, but JoJo made our experience memorable! We'll be back to see her and throw down some ZA..Nothing particularly special about the food but we are partial to Wahlburgers because of our Boston roots! Prices are what you'd expect for a strip place. Service is good!Kawaii Sushi and Asian Cuisine is the best in the Valley for authentic gourmet Chinese food! My mother is Chinese & I have experienced gourmet chinese food all over the United States and California in particular. Kawaii exceeded & surpassed my expectations by far. I was tremendously pleased with all of the chinese appetizers, soups, & dishes. If I had to choose my favorite it would be the cashew chicken. The fried rice is the best I've had in Arizona & probably the world hands down. I would drive to Kawaii just for the fried rice & I live in Scottsdale. If that doesn't tell you how good it is then I don't know what else to say. I particularly like the vegetable fried rice, it is the best I have ever had. Kelly the Owner\/Manager is a terrific host and is very knowledgeable about the food as well as the wines. She is always updating the menu with new items, drink specials, and has made some great recommendations. The staff is always friendly and attentive. I don't like egg in my rice and customize my orders, they never mind, and have never gotten them wrong. One time I forgot to mention that in my order and it came my way, they remembered I liked it that way, I was blown away, talk about customer service! The sushi bar has a nice vibe and they have a modern, very stylish, decor thats goes along with some asian style artwork on the walls and it really blends well. The restaurant is extraordinarily clean. I noticed it had a A rating and a award from CBS news for being 5 star clean. It has a nice little patio outside for extra outdoor seating. And, there are some nice TV's inside. They play some cool music in there too I noticed, adding to the hip ambiance & environment inside. I tried some of the sushi rolls, edamame, & the miso soup, it was super too! I just have a hard time not choosing the chinese dishes there because they remind me of California & have that true Chinese taste yet maintaining a twist to their own Kawaii inspired fusion of traditional chinese flavors. Overall, I am just impressed from top to bottom with this place. It just has a trendy, fresh, classy environment inside and the food has been terrific every time. With the atmosphere, service, drinks, and quality of the food it is like fine dining at a fraction of the price. They seem to be getting busier as I see more customers each time I go. Give this place a try and I promise you will be a repeat customer. This is one of the few 5 star reviews I have given on yelp.Horrible.  They switched egg beaters for eggs.  Then, made us pay because we ate it unknowingly.  It was awful but we were hungry and figured this was how they prepared aged.  The manager was rude.  Made us pay for half because we ate it.  I wish I could give no stars.
Don't blame the server.  How would a diner know with certainty that egg beaters were switched for eggs.  We only knew that when we got the bill.  Terrible customer service, even now.Went there about 4 cars in line to pay. Sat in the drive thru to pace an order for about 15min. No response after yelling hello. Drove up to the windows and watched a "lady" putting juice away by the window for about 5 min. Waited patiently for her to finish when she was done she got up and started stocking more stuff. Finally some guy came over and I asked if the drive thru was broken? He replied with a puzzling look and said ugh ya. So I said ok can I have 2 large frys and a large mocha. He then said oh we also only take cash. With that I left and will be driving a mile down the road to another McDonald's that actively has their sh$% together.  I guess after over paying these stellar employees they couldn't pay for the credit card companies fees or afford to buy and pen and paper to post a sign on the drive thru.  Have fun at that disaster of a place.Great poke place.  Fish was fresh as well as all the other ingredients.  I will definitely be frequenting this place.Frite Alors was a solid choice for a casual family meal with kids in tow. The atmosphere has a food-court vibe that doesn't encourage you to linger, but the food was good and the server helpful. It was a good way for our group to try poutine during our trip, and my pulled duck grilled cheese was excellent. Would recommend for a quick meal with a group if you happen to be in the area.My husband and I were on a sushi kick for a while and since our recent visit to the disappointing new Zen location in Markham, we thought we'd give Aoyama a try. 

We had a reservation and sat down in a packed dining room full of patrons enjoying dinner.  We ordered a sushi and sashimi omakase to try out the chef's offering for the day.  

The fish were fresh, well, mostly...with the exception of uni which had a bit of funk.  When it comes to eating sashimi, no amount of funk should ever be present.  Minus 2 stars.  

The service was very efficient as we were in and out of the restaurant in about an hour which is pretty impressive for any omakase meal.  

We may go back to try out their a la carte menu next time.Fresh fast Mexican! Maricris is really sweet at the counter. Margaritas for $4.95? Can you say YES???!!! Beer is on ice. My $6.99 chicken taco salad is HUGE and came w sour cream and guacamole! My honey's combos plate (taco, tostada) is crisp and tasty w rice and beans. The mild salsa has great flavor and the spicy salsa actually has a bite and is making my nose run. Wish we had a place like this back in Oregon! The only tip I have to offer is that they put a picture of a margarita in their window and on the menu bcuz we wouldn't have ordered one if Maricris hadn't mentioned it. :)What a pleasant surprise during my recent 6-day trip to Giants Spring Training!!  I went twice this trip--the first time for dinner and another time for lunch before a game.  For dinner, I was in a large group of 8 and the restaurant couldn't have been more accomodating.  We were greeted warmly and seated on time.  Food and drink service was equally friendly and efficient.  Nothing like a few margaritas and table-side guac-to-order to put one in the mood.  Ole!!  My lunch started with a wonderful mojito and some taco sliders.  Much better than ballpark food!  [fyi food at Scottsdale Stadium is MUCH better than Salt River!!  The Rockies, however, are looking good.]

The Mission is such a find and worth repeating...hopefully, just like our Giants!!

ps...I felt a little underdressed at dinner in my flip-flops.  Thankfully, the room is dimly lit.  The Mission is definitely a place to impress a date!Have always been a fan. My go-to whenever I go to eat dinner with a family member or friend, and now my go-to whenever I come back to visit. I like the one by Hilldale Mall a lot better than the one on the Capitol Square because there's a lot more space. 

Comfort food is what you'll find here...and comfort in general - you'll get more comfortable with the more beers you try. :)

My favorite dishes are the meat loaf and the smothered and covered chicken. (both fairly salty by the way - but the good salty...the kind of salty that makes sense). And if I'm feeling ambitious, the beer sampler. Sometimes it's a hit or miss with the meat loaf - most of the times I've ordered it it's been perfect and juicy. A few times it was a little dry, but just let them know and they fix it for you - how they fix it I do not know....I met a few friends for lunch here during the week and it was pretty busy.  They had a decent lunch drink special which is always a plus!  We shared the mongolian beef flat bread.  It was delicious.  I was tempted to order another one to take home but didn't.  You can order a lunch special during the week for $7.95.  My friend and I shared the Kung POW Beef.  It was just enough for the two of us, but probably because we are busy talking to each other instead of eating.  The service was ok...we waited a really long time to get our tab.  Otherwise, I would definitely go back.If you know what pho is supposed to taste like, this ain't it. Broth is watery and portions are small even when you order a large, it's like getting a regular. For a place that's supposed to specialize in pho, they sure aren't meeting in standards. Go to Nams Noodles instead!!!!!!Very good and interesting rolls.  Shaking beef is good as well.  Had hamachi kana (not pictured), it was ok.
Service was wonderful.
It's a beautiful place.Naked City Pizza on Paradise.. Sheesh.. Where do I start?! So I have been meaning to try this place out for quite sometime now and finally had the chance to do so when some friends came into town. Now this location is pretty much walking distance from the Hyatt Place hotel which was where my friends were staying. 

The night that we decided to give this place a shot there was pretty much no service whatsoever and what I mean by that is exactly what it sounds like.. No customer service... We called no lie about 4 times with no answer to the phone for a to-go order and finally maybe after the 5th attempt a woman answers the phone just to only place us BACK on hold.. If it wasn't for my friend being so adamant about wanting to have pizza from here I would've said screw it and went to one of the MANY pizza places in the area. The woman who came back on the phone was rather short and a bit rude because we had many questions about the menu. Oh and speaking of the menu the menu that they usually offer online wasn't able to be viewed because the website was down. SO yeah we of course would expect for some patience while we are trying to order food and give this business our money. 

One of the most rudest things a business can do is treat a potential customer with disrespect when trying to spend money at their establishment. Fast forward we ended up ordering the pizza, quoted the price as well as 30 minutes until the order would be ready. After arriving close to the time of what was told, while entering there was nobody at the front counter. A dim.. quiet place and after some minutes somebody finally came to the front who was the woman I assume was taking the orders. Told her my name and was then told the pizza still wasn't ready?.. How? It's a ghost town in here and furthermore you guys weren't doing anything but chatting back there..

Bottom Line.. Pizza was delicious but the customer service definitely left a bad taste in my mouth. Rule of thumb for me is I don't care how good the food is, if I'm not treated or welcomed warmly then I will never spend another DIME at your place of business. Period.Outlets under the bar.  Not just one, all around the bar. So helpful! Good atmosphere, music isn't too loud, seats are comfortable.  To top it off the service has been great.  The server was readily available, apparently my food came out incorrectly the first time but I didn't even notice because I got the food quickly.  Fries were great, spicy and sweet my fav. Manager and chef came by; I almost forgot I was in the airport! Thx Phoenix!Had dinner with my four sisters from out of town, on 4\/27\/14. Entrees included the Meatloaf, Chicken Alfredo, Chicken Skillet, Guacamole Chicken Salad, and a Corned Beef Reuben. All the meals came luke warm, closer to cold. Food was lacking in flavor. I have not heard one positive thing from my sisters about that meal. So I guess you could say it was a night to forget. Definitely do not recommend this place for anyone with a discerning palate. Also, the food came fast, like it was already plated and then barely warmed up. The waiter then more or less disappeared, had no knowledge of what he was trying to sell us. Acted more or less, like he could care less about our dining experience. This was my call since I am the local. So it is my fault for not researching further.I was super excited to try this place I've seen videos of their shakes\/burgers at their NY location and was happy to see it coming here! When I arrived I waited about five minutes when a hostess came up and offered a countertop type seating which was fine bc it's across the sports book so we could at least watch the game while eating. We ordered queso dip to start, and each our own burgers. 20\/25 minutes later our burgers came but no appetizer, we informed our server and she said they've been having kitchen mess-ups so she would check on it. We decided we would cancel I.T since our meal was pretty filling, I.T came out as soon as we informed her but they gave I.T to us and took I.T off our bill. All in all, burger was good, good amount of fries I.T totaled out to $46 (including one iced tea, we got special sauce for fries $1 charge for each) cool atmosphere but I can't justify the price when you can get the same quality burgers at five guys for a cheaper price! Nonetheless great place for a casual date night!This place needs to decide what it is.  Is it a sports bar?  Is it a dance club?  Is it a grill?  

Came in Saturday for food since everywhere else was closed and we wanted to try something that wasn't hickory tavern(again).

So very very loud.  Can't even hear myself think.  Seems like a serious distraction if you are trying to watch sports.  Acoustics are awful,  never thought I'd hear so many songs I love and hate hearing them.  Like ice picks in my ears.  DJ is terribad.  In no world does Turn Down For What seague into Sweet Home Alabama.  Just....no.

Brussels sprouts appetizer was drowning in sauce and not very good.   Union burger was delish, had the bacon added and it was on point.  Waffle fries probably the best I've ever had but I cannot see ever coming back unless it's for takeout.Have been here twice before and always enjoyed the food and service.  Today was a different story however by a long shot.  Having a late lunch I called in advance to find out what time they served until.  Being glad to find out they serve until 3, my guest and I got there at 2:10.  Our order was taken promptly enough, but then the wait began  Almost 15 minutes to get the salad I ordered and the lunch entrees were not served until 2:40.  This and the place was empty!  The long wait was only made worse by the horrible, and I mean horrible and way too loud background music.Very Problematic
I'm gay, I'm not ashamed to say it, but I felt ashamed of it inside the Valley Bar. We got sidewards glances from the staff nonstop, I was referred to as "boy" (b\/c I'm black, godforbid) & I was double charged, probably as a passive-aggressive FU. If you're looking for a place of tolerance & inclusion, DON'T COME TO THE VALLEY BAR! As a gay black man I have never felt more unwelcome, & I advise you to avoid this place too if you're looking for a place to chill.What a joke...ordered through Postmates and not only did we not receive one pizza, the other was burnt. Called the restaurant to be put on hold for five minutes to talk to a "Manager" who was rude and not helpful whatsoever. Don't waste your money on this overpriced garbage.Just wanted to get on here and thank Ki Pollo for the Braised Greens. Have had many bad orders of Greens in the Pittsburgh area. But yours were delicious. Great flavor, especially considering that they are completely vegetarian.Came here for their grand opening. It was really busy, but the staff was friendly and patient  The burgers and fries combo was great. Definitely coming back for more! I want to try other items on their menu.Went with my family to try out cheeburger cheeburger. The only good thing at this place is the hamburger meat itself. We ordered burgers and loaded fries. The burger came but it wasn't the right burger. They got our order wrong and the burger was cold. The loaded fries was ordered twice and it arrived after we finished our burgers. The first order of loaded fries had horseradish on it and we didn't order horseradish. The second order of fries which came after we finished came with the chili on the fries when we ordered it on the side. We also ordered crispy fries and it was not crispy at all. The shakes were okay and we were just wondering to ourselves because there was only two waitresses, would we still be waiting 30 minutes or a hour ? We wanted to try it, and came out unhappy.My fiancé and I decided to have a day of relaxation. Rather than stay at home we went to the Royal Palms Resort to have lunch and take advantage of the spa.  I have to tell you we had the best experience with everyone we encountered from the staff.   From the moment we got out of our car and was greeted by Thomas, to our server Brian who we enjoyed conversing with.  Then we spent the day at the spa.  I had the stone massage given by Dawn who was absolutely the best.  My fiancé had her Mani\/Pedi by Geri who was outstanding.  We then ventured down to the pool.  Both Anthony and Steven were awesome to deal with, making sure we had everything we needed.  After the poolside bar closed we were still a little hungry so we jumped on the poolside phone and had a wonderful burger by Jerry at poolside.   

We have had such a memorable time today we are already looking forward to our next visit.The food here is out of this world!  My wife and I shared 4 different tapas and each was so flavorful with healthy ingredients. The grilled octopus and the house gyozas were my personal favorites but even the side of roasted vegetables was incredible. Received top notch service from our waiter Tim and the decor and ambience gave a good vibe as well.Late night Las Vegas dining at its finest.  The wait staff is amazing. They will pretty much make any dish you want by combining home made pastas and home made sauces.

I had spaghetti and meatballs and it was amazing. My hubs had pappardelle mimmo, a seafood, sage, and butter dish. He loved it. Cory had gnocchi and pesto and liked it also.

Atmosphere is old world Vegas. You can imagine Sinatra at the piano.

Wine list is extensive and the wait staff, especially Miko, has a vast knowledge and requisite skill for pairing dishes with wines. 

We were all extremely happy with out visit to Ferraro's.The lover loves breweries and really wanted to try this place out so we came by one lovely evening. 

We came during the week in the evening so there was no wait and we got seated right away. I absolutely loved everything about this place. The food is good, they have a very big menu, the beer is good, good customer service and a big patio that is dog friendly. I ordered the Mac and cheese and it was absolutely delicious. Super cheesy, just the way it should be. 

I love that they are dog friendly because that means we can bring our little brat. Our waiter was new, but he was extremely knowledgable and attentive. We'll definitely be back!!We loved this place!  Shared the 32oz bone-in Rib-eye, Perfect.  Our waiter was Todd, wonderful service!  Takes dining on Fremont Street to a new level!Great customer services. They have the best wings ever. Amazing customer service. Everyone is so nice as soon as you walk in. I will be back soon. You won't be disappointed.Melt is.. awesome!  I was honestly not really expecting a whole lot from the online menu due to the high prices for a grilled cheese place, but I'm very glad to have given it a shot.

The prices are indeed high, but the portions are huge.  I had been going to Winking Lizard quite a bit due to its closeness, but Melt is a much better value.  A dollar or 2 more for nearly twice as much food.  I could barely finish, but I wanted to so badly because everything tasted amazing.

I had the veggie burger, which is served on bread like a sandwich, with smoked gouda.  The burger itself was thick and perfectly cooked with a mild sweetness that you don't usually find in a veggie burger... but it worked.  The fries were very well done... not those greasy stringy fries you find at a lot of pubs.  They went perfectly with sriracha mixed with some ketchup.  The coleslaw was also way better than I thought that it would be.  I'm not normally a huge fan of vinegar based slaw, but this stuff was some of the best I've ever had.  I don't know what they put in the stuff, but it probably involves crack considering how impossible it is to stop eating.  The beer selection is also quite good with pretty fair prices even durning non happy hour.

I will absolutely be back, and when I eventually move from Cleveland after school I have a feeling that this place will be missed the most.  The only downside is that parking can be a bit of a challenge, but that seems pretty common around this area.Beautiful restaurant with amazing views. I ordered off the happy hour menu and food was great! The dinner menu is well rounded with something for everyone, but on the pricey side but from what I observed the dishes are exquisitely presented and portion size plentiful. Atmosphere is classy and a great end to a long day of work. A great place for a special celebration or impressive date night. I am a business traveler so I ate alone but enjoyed my evening watching the sunset over the city.I really like this place, it's got great wine, and the food was just right. I wish it was closer to my house.Great menu. The food and service were excellent . This is a nice spot to take a break and eat some good foodNasty chilakilles one of the worst i had 
Went I got home uoss to late..

Clean place 
I was there b4 for a burrito and was kindda ok ...

May come back to that location ...Giving this one star bc the people that work there are some of the most rude ive ever met in my life. Pizza is good but it isnt a very inviting place to goThe restaurant looks really nice and the service is great as well. I had the Huevos Rancheros which was really tasty. Portions are big though. In general, great place for brunch.So.  Good.

Would eat here every single day if able.  I split a margherita with my two young kids - size was just right.

... try to avoid facing the door near sunset.  Liiiittle bright.Awesomeness between a brioche bun!

I was totally excited to try this place...with so many awesome reviews and pictures I was just knew I was going to fall in love! And this place did not disappoint!

We went on a Saturday afternoon, they had a small wait but offered immediate seating on the heated patio. We opted to sit out on the patio, and it was really nice! Very comfortable and warm, which was a pleasant surprise!

Our waitress greeted us immedietly, and gave us our menus. Those menus are ridicilous! I had no idea where to start....but when in doubt...start with a cold glass of beer! I selected the Purple Haze-which was light bodied with a hint of raspberry. It was very refreshing and delicious! 

Now back to that awesome menu...I decided to try one of the amazing burgers. I chose the The Jalapeño Popper Show-Stopper- cool name right?? Well it's an even better burger! 

This burger came loaded with jalapeño-infused cream cheese, jalapeño bacon and fried jalapeños. Served on a brioche bun with jalapeño citrus aioli, lettuce, tomato and fresh sliced jalapeños. 

WOWsers!!! I chose to sub the beef patty with a veggie burger and that was an awesome desision! It was packed with several different beans, cranberries and delicious veggies! That jalepeno cream cheese was heavenly...and fried and fresh jalepenos together was a wonderful combination for the burger. It has a nice kick with each bite!  If you love a little bit of spicy this burger is for you! 

There are TONS of sushi options and other burgers that I'm looking forward to trying...so I'm sure to be back very soon!2013 HALO-HALO CHALLENGE - Contender #10

Our Halo-Halo Challenge stops at 10 locations, with Goldilocks as our last contender.  We decided early that Goldilocks would be last because they have been around for quite some time with 21 locations in the US, it was recommended by others, and we remember that their Halo-Halo was pretty good.  In other words, we wanted to save the best for last.  What we found was some inconsistencies to how I remember Goldilocks' Halo-Halo to be.  Cost for their Halo-Halo is $4.99. Ingredients included kaong, pinipig, nata de coco, macapuno, red beans, ube ice cream, lanka, condensed milk, and shave ice all mixed together.  Missing was real ube and flan.  Halo-Halo means "Mix-Mix" and that's what you do to eat this treat.  You start with this pretty dessert and you mix it.  But what I found at Goldilocks is that they tend to mix mix what they put in their Halo-Halo.  I've had Halo-Halo from Goldilocks from locations ranging from their Philippines, NorCal, SoCal, and now Vegas.  I swear flan and even legit ube was in their "Mix-Mix". I guess all locations are different, which left me disappointed when I didn't get what I wanted in their Halo-Halo. Overall, I still finished my Halo-Halo but would not consider theirs as my favorite.  Sorry Goldilocks, but you need flan and ube in your Halo-Halo to make me happy. 

Like some of the other Halo-Halo contenders, food was also taste tested.  I wanted their chicken BBQ on a stick because the pictures on the menu looked so delicious. But they were out and this wasn't the first time this happened to me.  I ended up with their half chicken BBQ with garlic fried rice.  Just a note, folks...rice is not included with their meals.  You have to order rice separate. So, don't assume you're getting it and they don't ask you either. My meal still hit the spot. My Halo-Halo was just okay, but at last their chicken BBQ was good.  

PS:  We committed to ending this challenge at 10 locations. We know there's more out there (ie, Nanay Gloria's, Red Ribbon, DT's, etc).  Maybe part 2 of this challenge is in the future, maybe not.  One things for sure, we're both ready to get back to eating clean and training mean.  This Halo-Halo Challenge was a great way for me to decompress from all that damn grilled chicken breast.

Contender #9 (Ito'y Sariling Atin):  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/itoy-sariling-atin-las-vegas#hrid:X3FQeLTQycMELQ66wgpvIQWasn't  sure about this steakhouse based on the inconsistency of the reviews; however, the food and service was absolutely SUPERB! While extremely pricey, it exceeded my expectations. Ribeye extremely  tender, scallops melted in my mouth. Asparagus seasoned well. Other guests enjoyed lobster, filet, rack of lamb and chicken. 

Great view of strip although it is an off strip hotel. Waiters tended to every need. 

Dessert was top of the line as well.
