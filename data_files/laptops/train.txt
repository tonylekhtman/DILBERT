I O
charge O
it O
at O
night O
and O
skip O
taking O
the O
cord B-AS
with O
me O
because O
of O
the O
good O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
. O

I O
bought O
a O
HP O
Pavilion O
DV4 O
- O
1222nr O
laptop O
and O
have O
had O
so O
many O
problems O
with O
the O
computer O
. O

The O
tech B-AS
guy I-AS
then O
said O
the O
service B-AS
center I-AS
does O
not O
do O
1-to-1 O
exchange O
and O
I O
have O
to O
direct O
my O
concern O
to O
the O
" B-AS
sales I-AS
" I-AS
team I-AS
, O
which O
is O
the O
retail O
shop O
which O
I O
bought O
my O
netbook O
from O
. O

I O
investigated O
netbooks O
and O
saw O
the O
Toshiba O
NB305-N410BL O
. O

The O
other O
day O
I O
had O
a O
presentation O
to O
do O
for O
a O
seminar O
at O
a O
large O
conference O
in O
town O
lots O
of O
people O
, O
little O
time O
to O
prep O
and O
have O
to O
set O
up O
a O
computer O
to O
a O
projector O
, O
etc O
. O

it O
is O
of O
high O
quality B-AS
, O
has O
a O
killer O
GUI B-AS
, O
is O
extremely O
stable O
, O
is O
highly O
expandable O
, O
is O
bundled O
with O
lots O
of O
very O
good O
applications B-AS
, O
is O
easy O
to O
use B-AS
, O
and O
is O
absolutely O
gorgeous O
. O

Easy O
to O
start B-AS
up I-AS
and O
does O
not O
overheat O
as O
much O
as O
other O
laptops O
. O

Sad O
very O
SAD O
. O

I O
even O
got O
my O
teenage O
son O
one O
, O
because O
of O
the O
features B-AS
that O
it O
offers O
, O
like O
, O
iChat B-AS
, O
Photobooth B-AS
, O
garage B-AS
band I-AS
and O
more O
! O

Needless O
to O
say O
a O
PC O
that O
ca O
n't O
support O
a O
cell O
phone O
is O
less O
than O
useless O
! O

Great O
laptop O
that O
offers O
many O
great O
features B-AS
! O

they O
have O
done O
absolutely O
nothing O
to O
fix O
the O
computer O
problem O
. O

One O
night O
I O
turned O
the O
freaking O
thing O
off O
after O
using O
it O
, O
the O
next O
day O
I O
turn O
it O
on O
, O
no O
GUI B-AS
, O
screen B-AS
all O
dark O
, O
power B-AS
light I-AS
steady O
, O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
light I-AS
steady O
and O
not O
flashing O
as O
it O
usually O
does O
. O

Still O
pretty O
pricey O
, O
but O
I O
' O
ve O
been O
putting O
off O
money O
for O
a O
while O
as O
a O
little O
Macbook O
Fund O
, O
and O
finally O
got O
to O
use O
it O
. O

I O
took O
it O
back O
for O
an O
Asus O
and O
same O
thing O
blue O
screen O
which O
required O
me O
to O
remove O
the O
battery B-AS
to O
reset O
. O

In O
the O
shop O
, O
these O
MacBooks O
are O
encased O
in O
a O
soft O
rubber B-AS
enclosure I-AS
, O
so O
you O
will O
never O
know O
about O
the O
razor O
edge B-AS
until O
you O
buy O
it O
, O
get O
it O
home O
, O
break O
the O
seal O
and O
use O
it O
very O
clever O
con O
. O

However O
, O
the O
multi B-AS
- I-AS
touch I-AS
gestures I-AS
and O
large O
tracking B-AS
area I-AS
make O
having O
an O
external B-AS
mouse I-AS
unnecessary O
unless O
you O
're O
gaming B-AS
. O

Plus O
it O
is O
small O
and O
reasonably O
light O
so O
I O
can O
take O
it O
with O
me O
to O
and O
from O
work O
. O

I O
HATE O
this O
one O
. O

They O
were O
totally O
unconcerned O
that O
the O
computer O
was O
not O
correctly O
repaired O
in O
the O
first O
place O
. O

Toshiba O
does O
not O
send O
any O
one O
out O
unless O
you O
have O
paid O
extra O
to O
have O
the O
on O
site O
repair O
done O
. O

Oh O
, O
boy O
! O

But O
while O
this O
is O
one O
big O
advantage O
as O
you O
may O
know O
from O
the O
company O
s O
recent O
commercials O
there O
are O
other O
things O
to O
consider O
before O
going O
with O
Apple O
. O

I O
love O
the O
way O
the O
entire O
suite B-AS
of I-AS
software I-AS
works O
together O
. O

The O
speed B-AS
is O
incredible O
and O
I O
am O
more O
than O
satisfied O
. O

on O
the O
bright O
side O
at O
least O
I O
was O
n't O
without O
my O
laptop O
for O
long O
this O
time O
! O

This O
laptop O
meets O
every O
expectation O
and O
Windows B-AS
7 I-AS
is O
great O
! O

That O
's O
how O
frustrating O
it O
was O
. O

I O
can O
barely O
use O
any O
usb B-AS
devices I-AS
because O
they O
will O
not O
stay O
connected O
properly O
. O

The O
one O
down O
side O
to O
it O
is O
that O
when O
I O
play O
a O
certin O
game O
on O
here O
, O
it O
tends O
to O
freeze O
up O
sometimes O
, O
but O
that O
s O
the O
only O
bad O
thing O
about O
this O
computer O
. O

-No O
backlit O
keyboard O
, O
but O
not O
an O
issue O
for O
me O
. O

When O
I O
finally O
had O
everything O
running O
with O
all O
my O
software B-AS
installed O
I O
plugged O
in O
my O
droid O
to O
recharge O
and O
the O
system B-AS
crashed O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
even O
turn O
it O
off O
. O

One O
suggestion O
I O
do O
have O
, O
is O
to O
not O
bother O
getting O
Microsoft B-AS
office I-AS
for I-AS
the I-AS
mac I-AS
expecting O
it O
will O
work O
just O
like O
you O
knew O
it O
to O
on O
a O
PC O
. O

Pairing O
it O
with O
an O
iPhone O
is O
a O
pure O
pleasure O
, O
talk O
about O
painless O
syncing B-AS
, O
used O
to O
take O
me O
forever O
, O
now O
it O
's O
a O
snap O
. O

I O
shopped O
around O
before O
buying O
. O

I O
also O
got O
the O
added O
bonus O
of O
a O
30 B-AS
" I-AS
HD I-AS
Monitor I-AS
, O
which O
really O
helps O
to O
extend O
my O
screen B-AS
and O
keep O
my O
eyes O
fresh O
! O

Would O
do O
business O
again O
. O

The O
machine O
is O
slow O
to O
boot B-AS
up I-AS
and O
occasionally O
crashes O
completely O
. O

After O
paying O
several O
hundred O
dollars O
for O
this O
service B-AS
, O
it O
is O
frustrating O
that O
you O
can O
not O
get O
help O
after O
hours O
. O

I O
have O
had O
the O
luxury O
sarcasm O
of O
owning O
2 O
of O
these O
laptops O
. O

What O
a O
waste O
. O

It O
was O
a O
total O
Dhell O
experience O
that O
I O
will O
never O
repeat O
. O

There O
are O
a O
few O
flaws O
as O
well O
that O
I O
noticed O
. O

Completely O
worth O
every O
single O
penny O
dime O
and O
nickel O
. O

I O
tried O
to O
upgrade O
it O
to O
a O
newer O
version O
a O
couple O
of O
months O
ago O
and O
I O
still O
have O
the O
same O
problem O
. O

I O
did O
have O
to O
replace O
the O
battery O
once O
, O
but O
that O
was O
only O
a O
couple O
months O
ago O
and O
it O
's O
been O
working O
perfect O
ever O
since O
. O

, O
In O
the O
past O
four O
years O
I O
' O
ve O
had O
it O
I O
have O
never O
once O
gotten O
a O
virus O
. O

I O
love O
the O
operating B-AS
system I-AS
and O
the O
preloaded B-AS
software I-AS
. O

They O
were O
great O
in O
handling O
this O
problem O
, O
and O
I O
' O
m O
looking O
forward O
in O
purchasing O
additonal O
products O
from O
them O
in O
the O
future O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
tried O
going O
back O
to O
XL O
but O
there O
still O
problems O
. O

The O
best O
thing O
about O
this O
laptop O
is O
the O
price B-AS
along O
with O
some O
of O
the O
newer O
features B-AS
. O

After O
numerous O
attempts O
of O
trying O
including O
setting O
the O
clock B-AS
in I-AS
BIOS I-AS
setup I-AS
directly O
, O
I O
gave O
upI O
am O
a O
techie O
. O

YOU O
WILL O
NOT O
BE O
ABLE O
TO O
TALK O
TO O
AN O
AMERICAN O
WARRANTY B-AS
SERVICE I-AS
IS O
OUT O
OF O
COUNTRY O
. O

But O
it O
may O
be O
potentially O
hundreds O
or O
thousands O
in O
the O
near O
future O
. O

Has O
met O
or O
exceeded O
my O
needs O
for O
a O
compact O
travel O
device O
. O

but O
now O
i O
have O
realized O
its O
a O
problem O
with O
this O
brand B-AS
. O

It O
can O
not O
save O
the O
correct O
date O
and O
time O
I O
set O
. O

I O
sent O
it O
back O
to O
Toshiba O
twice O
they O
covered O
it O
under O
the O
warranty B-AS
. O

And O
this O
is O
n't O
just O
my O
one O
experine O
. O

They O
sent O
me O
a O
replacement O
part O
and O
without O
informing O
me O
are O
requiring O
that O
I O
return O
it O
within O
15 O
days O
or O
contact O
them O
and O
let O
them O
know O
the O
broken O
part O
will O
be O
returned O
later O
. O

I O
was O
looking O
for O
a O
mac O
which O
is O
portable O
and O
has O
all O
the O
features B-AS
that O
I O
was O
looking O
for O
. O

I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
this O
one O
to O
my O
friends O

I O
honestly O
love O
my O
mac O
, O
that O
s O
why O
I O
am O
a O
self O
proclaimed O
mac O
addict O
. O

And O
these O
are O
some O
reasons O
you O
should O
get O
a O
macbook O
pro O
. O

Also O
kinda O
loud O
when O
the O
fan B-AS
was O
running O
. O

In O
desparation O
, O
I O
called O
their O
Customer B-AS
Service I-AS
number I-AS
and O
was O
told O
that O
my O
warranty B-AS
had O
expired O
2 O
days O
old O
and O
that O
the O
priviledge O
of O
talking B-AS
to I-AS
a I-AS
technician I-AS
would O
cost O
me O
have O
your O
credit O
card O
ready O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
laptop O
while O
on O
a O
business O
trip O
to O
keep O
up O
with O
my O
email O
. O

There O
also O
seemed O
to O
be O
a O
problem O
with O
the O
hard B-AS
disc I-AS
as O
certain O
times O
windows B-AS
loads O
but O
claims O
to O
not O
be O
able O
to O
find O
any O
drivers B-AS
or O
files O
. O

Drivers B-AS
updated O
ok O
but O
the O
BIOS B-AS
update I-AS
froze O
the O
system B-AS
up O
and O
the O
computer O
shut O
down O
. O

-they O
lost O
my O
laptop O
for O
a O
month O

Spent O
2 O
hours O
on O
phone O
with O
HP B-AS
Technical I-AS
Support I-AS
. O

This O
is O
my O
second O
laptop O
, O
and O
it O
is O
head O
and O
shoulders O
above O
my O
first O
. O

at O
first O
! O

Speaking O
of O
the O
browser B-AS
, O
it O
too O
has O
problems O
. O

I O
think O
just O
going O
from O
PC O
to O
Mac O
has O
gotten O
me O
totally O
spoiled O
and O
I O
ca O
n't O
imagine O
ever O
going O
back O
. O

The O
keyboard B-AS
is O
too O
slick O
. O

Nightly O
my O
computer O
defrags O
itself O
and O
runs O
a O
virus B-AS
scan I-AS
. O

It O
's O
like O
9 B-AS
punds I-AS
, O
but O
if O
you O
can O
look O
past O
it O
, O
it O
's O
GREAT O
! O

It O
's O
just O
as O
fast O
with O
one O
program B-AS
open O
as O
it O
is O
with O
sixteen O
open O
. O

Still O
under O
warrenty B-AS
so O
called O
Toshiba O
, O
no O
help O
at O
all O
. O

I O
was O
happy O
with O
My O
purchase O
of O
a O
Toshiba O
Satellite O
L305D O
- O
S5934 O
laptop O
until O
it O
came O
time O
to O
have O
it O
repaired O
under O
the O
Toshiba B-AS
Warranty I-AS
. O

I O
LOVE O
IT O
! O

Amazing O
Quality B-AS
! O

The O
fact O
that O
you O
can O
spend O
over O
$ O
100 O
on O
just O
a O
webcam B-AS
underscores O
the O
value B-AS
of O
this O
machine O
. O

I O
mainly O
use O
it O
for O
email O
, O
internet B-AS
, O
and O
managing B-AS
personal I-AS
files I-AS
pics O
, O
vids O
, O
etc O
. O

A O
month O
or O
so O
ago O
, O
the O
freaking O
motherboard B-AS
just O
died O
. O

The O
system B-AS
it O
comes O
with O
does O
not O
work O
properly O
, O
so O
when O
trying O
to O
fix O
the O
problems O
with O
it O
it O
started O
not O
working O
at O
all O
. O

Then O
after O
4 O
or O
so O
months O
the O
charger B-AS
stopped O
working O
so O
I O
was O
forced O
to O
go O
out O
and O
buy O
new O
hardware B-AS
just O
to O
keep O
this O
computer O
running O
. O

I O
took O
it O
back O
to O
Best O
Buy O
where O
they O
were O
so O
helpful O
and O
immediately O
gave O
me O
a O
new O
one O
. O

If O
you O
had O
PC O
for O
four O
years O
I O
can O
almost O
gaurentee O
that O
something O
would O
of O
gone O
wrong O
by O
now O
, O
maybe O
even O
forcing O
you O
to O
replace O
your O
entire O
computer O
. O

* O
2 O
weeks O
after O
giving O
the O
computer O
for O
repair*-Called O
headquarters O
, O
they O
report O
that O
they O
have O
not O
looked O
at O
it O
yet O
but O
it O
is O
on O
the O
top O
of O
the O
stack O
. O

This O
machine O
delivers O
. O

Then O
2 O
of O
my O
nephews O
were O
going O
into O
music O
and O
both O
fell O
in O
love O
with O
the O
MacBook O
Pro O
. O

I O
complain O
again O
. O

This O
laptop O
is O
insane O
! O
! O
! O

If O
a O
website O
ever O
freezes O
which O
is O
rare O
, O
its O
really O
easy O
to O
force B-AS
quit I-AS
. O

It O
does O
run O
a O
little O
warm O
but O
that O
is O
a O
negligible O
concern O
. O

It O
rarely O
works B-AS
and O
when O
it O
does O
it O
's O
incredibly O
slow O
. O

I O
also O
enjoy O
the O
fact O
that O
my O
MacBook O
Pro O
laptop O
allows O
me O
to O
run O
Windows B-AS
7 I-AS
on O
it O
by O
using O
the O
VMWare B-AS
program I-AS
. O

It O
's O
so O
much O
easier O
to O
navigate B-AS
through O
the O
operating B-AS
system I-AS
, O
to O
find B-AS
files I-AS
, O
and O
it O
runs B-AS
a O
lot O
faster O
! O

Purchased O
a O
Toshiba O
Lap O
top O
it O
worked O
good O
until O
just O
after O
the O
warrenty B-AS
went O
out O
. O

I O
always O
swore O
by O
PCs O
and O
would O
never O
consider O
a O
MAC O
. O

what O
an O
elegant O
, O
wonderful O
machine O
. O

This O
is O
now O
my O
3rd O
MacBook O
Pro O
and O
I O
really O
honestly O
love O
it O
! O

for O
2 O
months O
. O

I O
wanted O
to O
purchase O
the O
extended B-AS
warranty I-AS
and O
they O
refused O
, O
because O
they O
knew O
it O
was O
trouble O
. O

Do O
you O
ever O
think O
HP O
would O
do O
that O
? O
NEVER O
! O

We O
upgraded O
the O
memory B-AS
to O
four O
gigabytes O
in O
order O
to O
take O
advantage O
of O
the O
performace B-AS
increase O
in O
speed B-AS
. O

It O
's O
not O
like O
I O
have O
used O
for O
half O
a O
year O
and O
then O
complained O
about O
it O
. O

Still O
trying O
to O
learn O
how O
to O
use O
it O
. O

The O
reality O
was O
, O
it O
heated O
up O
very O
quickly O
, O
and O
took O
way O
too O
long O
to O
do O
simple O
things O
, O
like O
opening B-AS
my I-AS
Documents I-AS
folder I-AS
. O

I O
bought O
the O
netbook O
because O
it O
was O
smaller O
and O
lighter O
for O
me O
to O
carry O
around O
. O

The O
Genius O
at O
the O
Apple O
store O
advised O
me O
that O
there O
was O
nothing O
about O
my O
use O
of O
the O
computer O
that O
caused O
this O
failure O
. O

We O
'll O
save O
our O
money O
to O
replace O
it O
with O
a O
Mac O
again O
! O

Thank O
you O
for O
your O
great O
product O
! O

this O
company O
truely O
does O
make O
horrible O
products O
and O
does O
nt O
seem O
to O
because O
they O
are O
certain O
things O
like O
this O
never O
happen O
. O

I O
had O
always O
used O
PCs O
and O
been O
constantly O
frustrated O
by O
the O
crashing O
and O
the O
poorly O
designed O
operating B-AS
systems I-AS
that O
were O
never O
very O
intuitive O
. O

Sorry O
Toshiba O
, O
but O
1st O
impressions O
do O
count O
for O
something O
. O

Then O
, O
within O
5 O
months O
, O
the O
charger B-AS
crapped O
out O
on O
me O
. O

And O
if O
you O
have O
a O
iphone O
or O
ipod O
touch O
you O
can O
connect O
and O
download O
songs O
to O
it O
at O
high O
speed B-AS
. O

Overall O
this O
laptop O
is O
great O
. O

I O
love O
the O
glass B-AS
touchpad I-AS
. O

I O
continued O
to O
take O
the O
computer O
in O
AGAIN O
and O
they O
replaced O
the O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
and O
mother B-AS
board I-AS
yet O
again O
. O

I O
am O
using O
the O
external B-AS
speaker I-AS
sound I-AS
is O
good O
. O

The O
Apple O
MC371LL O
/ O
A O
24Ghz O
154-inch O
MacBook O
Pro O
Notebook O
is O
a O
horrible O
waste O
of O
money O
. O

Ok O
, O
this O
is O
probably O
the O
best O
laptop O
series O
ever O
devised O
by O
Apple O
. O

As O
of O
a O
couple O
weeks O
ago O
the O
middle O
portion O
of O
the O
laptop O
from O
top O
to O
bottom O
, O
, O
, O
about O
4 O
inches O
across O
is O
hardly O
visible O
. O

still O
testing O
the O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
as O
i O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
better O
, O
but O
am O
very O
happy O
with O
the O
upgrade O
. O

Then O
HP O
sends O
it O
back O
to O
me O
with O
the O
hardware B-AS
screwed O
up O
, O
not O
able O
to O
connect O
. O

I O
just O
hope O
the O
reputation O
that O
Toshiba O
has O
is O
true O
and O
I O
wo O
n't O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
a O
crash O
. O

Oh O
yeah O
, O
do O
n't O
forget O
the O
expensive O
shipping B-AS
to O
and O
from O
HP O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
anyone O
to O
buy O
from O
pcconnection O
express O
. O

Good O
luck O
. O

Everything O
is O
so O
easy O
to O
use B-AS
, O
Mac B-AS
software I-AS
is O
just O
so O
much O
simpler O
than O
Microsoft B-AS
software I-AS
. O

My O
favorite O
by O
far O
, O
although O
the O
most O
expensive O
, O
was O
my O
Sony O
. O

And O
if O
you O
do O
a O
lot O
of O
writing O
, O
editing B-AS
is O
a O
problem O
since O
there O
is O
no O
forward O
delete B-AS
key I-AS
. O

Also O
I O
typed O
faster O
then O
then O
letters O
would O
show O
and O
it O
got O
to O
be O
realy O
annoying O
. O

As O
an O
owner O
of O
a O
Toshiba O
Satalite O
laptop O
computer O
things O
you O
should O
know O
before O
you O
buy O
. O

Its O
ease O
of O
use B-AS
and O
the O
top O
service B-AS
from O
Apple O
be O
it O
their O
phone B-AS
assistance I-AS
or O
bellying O
up O
to O
the O
genius B-AS
bar I-AS
can O
not O
be O
beat O
. O

It O
has O
a O
10 O
hour O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
when O
you O
're O
doing O
web B-AS
browsing I-AS
and O
word B-AS
editing I-AS
, O
making O
it O
perfect O
for O
the O
classroom O
or O
office O
, O
and O
in O
terms O
of O
gaming B-AS
and O
movie B-AS
playing I-AS
it O
'll O
have O
a O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
of O
just O
over O
5 O
hours O
. O

I O
shipped O
out O
on O
Saturday O
, O
July O
17 O
. O

I O
bought O
it O
for O
really O
cheap O
also O
and O
it O
's O
AMAZING O
. O

Acer O
has O
set O
me O
up O
with O
FREE O
recovery B-AS
discs I-AS
, O
when O
they O
are O
available O
since O
I O
asked O
. O

I O
also O
purchased O
Office B-AS
Max I-AS
's I-AS
" I-AS
Max I-AS
Assurance I-AS
" I-AS
with O
the O
no O
lemon O
clause O

If O
you O
find O
yourself O
in O
the O
market O
for O
a O
new O
laptop O
and O
have O
the O
money O
do O
n't O
exclude O
looking O
at O
the O
MBPs O
. O

I O
eventually O
did O
the O
migration O
from O
my O
iMac B-AS
backup I-AS
disc I-AS
which O
uses O
USB B-AS
. O

Those O
things O
are O
very O
important O
, O
vital O
even O
! O

-They O
say O
it O
will O
take O
up O
to O
two O
weeks O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
like O
one O
thing O
about O
it O
. O

The O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
seems O
to O
be O
very O
good O
, O
and O
have O
had O
no O
issues O
with O
it O
. O

Enabling O
the O
battery B-AS
timer I-AS
is O
useless O
. O

Temperatures B-AS
on O
the O
outside O
were O
alright O
but O
i O
did O
not O
track O
in O
Core B-AS
Processing I-AS
Unit I-AS

. O

Yeah O
, O
to O
you O
. O

I O
got O
a O
mac O
as O
my O
HS O
graduation O
gift O
. O

I O
have O
now O
had O
it O
for O
15 O
months O
and O
love O
it O
. O

It O
turned O
out O
it O
's O
not O
really O
a O
problem O
to O
have O
a O
Mac O
. O

Page O
just O
disapeared O
after O
you O
got O
yahoo O
or O
downloaded O
something O
. O

Images O
can O
be O
multi O
- O
selected O
and O
viewed O
swiftly O
or O
in O
slideshow O
mode O
. O

Going O
to O
bring O
it O
to O
service B-AS
today O
. O

There O
is O
no O
need O
to O
purchase O
virus B-AS
protection I-AS
for I-AS
Mac I-AS
, O
which O
saves O
me O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
and O
money O
. O

But O
we O
had O
paid O
for O
bluetooth B-AS
, O
and O
there O
was O
none O
. O

So O
, O
I O
paid O
a O
visit O
to O
LG B-AS
notebook I-AS
service I-AS
center I-AS
at O
Alexandra O
Road O
, O
hoping O
they O
can O
make O
the O
hinge B-AS
tighter O
. O

My O
daughter O
uses O
it O
for O
games B-AS
, O
email O
, O
facebook O
, O
pictures O
and O
music O
. O

Laptop O
is O
to O
be O
used O
like O
a O
Netbook O
. O

It O
is O
always O
reliable O
, O
never O
bugged O
and O
responds B-AS
well O
. O

After O
about O
a O
week O
I O
finally O
got O
it O
back O
and O
was O
told O
that O
the O
motherboard B-AS
had O
failed O
and O
so O
they O
installed O
a O
new O
motherboard B-AS
. O

Trying O
to O
balance O
all O
of O
my O
roles O
leaves O
very O
little O
time O
for O
me O
to O
do O
anything O
, O
so O
I O
want O
to O
manage O
my O
time O
I O
do O
have O
to O
be O
the O
most O
efficient O
. O

It O
was O
slow O
, O
locked O
up O
, O
and O
also O
had O
hardware B-AS
replaced O
after O
only O
2 O
months O
! O

they O
had O
to O
replace O
the O
motherboard B-AS
in O
April O

Yes O
, O
the O
computer O
was O
light O
weight O
, O
less O
expensive O
than O
the O
average O
laptop O
, O
and O
was O
pretty O
self O
explantory O
in O
use B-AS
. O

Also O
, O
if O
you O
need O
to O
talk O
to O
a O
representive B-AS
at I-AS
Microsoft I-AS
, O
there O
is O
a O
charge O
, O
which O
I O
believe O
is O
robbery O
, O
since O
you O
are O
charged O
enormous O
amounts O
for O
a O
very O
badly O
designed O
system B-AS
, O
which O
most O
people O
would O
have O
went O
with O
XP B-AS
if O
they O
could O
. O

There O
is O
a O
little O
indent O
to O
help O
open O
it O
, O
but O
good O
luck O
with O
that O
. O

I O
love O
WIndows B-AS
7 I-AS
which O
is O
a O
vast O
improvment O
over O
Vista B-AS
. O

Also O
, O
I O
have O
alot O
of O
trouble O
with O
it O
getting O
very O
hot O
, O
and O
not O
even O
sitting O
on O
anything O
to O
make O
it O
hot O
. O

It O
Was O
a O
great O
deal O
after O
all O
. O

This O
mac O
is O
great O
! O

Keyboard B-AS
is O
great O
, O
very O
quiet O
for O
all O
the O
typing O
that O
I O
do O
. O

I O
grew O
up O
in O
a O
design O
family O
so O
it O
only O
made O
sense O
. O

Gave O
phonenumber O
. O

It O
would O
take O
up O
too O
much O
time O
to O
do O
reaearch O
for O
my O
papers O
and O
I O
would O
be O
up O
hours O
- O
just O
because O
the O
computer O
was O
too O
slow O
. O

Oh O
my O
goodness O
- O
I O
am O
not O
a O
happy O
camper O
. O

Dell B-AS
's I-AS

is O
an O
insult O
to O
it O
's O
customers O
who O
pay O
good O
money O
for O
shoddy O
products O
. O

I O
'd O
recommend O
this O
laptop O
to O
anyone O
! O

Yet O
, O
HP O
wo O
n't O
do O
anything O
about O
the O
problem O
. O

i O
' O
m O
returning O
mine O

It O
had O
a O
cooling B-AS
system I-AS
malfunction O
after O
10 O
minutes O
of O
general O
use B-AS
, O
and O
would O
not O
move O
past O
this O
error O
. O

I O
can O
render O
AVCHD O
movies O
with O
little O
effort O
, O
which O
was O
a O
problem O
for O
most O
pc O
's O
unless O
you O
had O
a O
quad B-AS
core I-AS
I7 I-AS
. O

It O
's O
a O
bummer O
and O
one O
out O
of O
five O
is O
being O
kind O
. O

This O
is O
what O
they O
told O
me O
, O
It O
heats O
up O
, O
and O
that O
is O
the O
reason O
we O
no O
longer O
call O
them O
laptops O
, O
and O
simply O
categorize O
them O
as O
portables O
. O

After O
talking O
it O
over O
with O
the O
very O
knowledgeable O
sales B-AS
associate I-AS
, O
I O
chose O
the O
MacBook O
Pro O
over O
the O
white O
MacBook O
. O

If O
you O
really O
want O
a O
bang O
- O
up O
system B-AS
and O
do O
n't O
need O
to O
run O
Windows B-AS
applications I-AS
, O
go O
with O
an O
Apple O
; O

You O
wo O
n't O
have O
to O
spend O
gobs O
of O
money O
on O
some O
inefficient O
virus B-AS
program I-AS
that O
needs O
to O
be O
updated O
every O
month O
and O
that O
constantly O
drains O
your O
wallet O
. O

This O
laptop O
is O
fast O
and O
you O
will O
literally O
learn O
all O
you O
can O
do O
with O
this O
dynamo O
by O
just O
watching O
the O
online O
tutorials O
. O

One O
of O
them O
seems O
to O
have O
worked O
. O

Which O
I O
still O
use O
and O
have O
hooked O
up O
to O
my O
TV O
. O

The O
problem O
I O
had O
with O
this O
unit O
was O
unresolvable O
. O

It O
weighed B-AS
like O
seven B-AS
pounds I-AS
or O
something O
like O
that O
. O

2 O
months O
later O
, O
the O
battery B-AS
went O
. O

You O
may O
need O
to O
special O
order O
a O
bag B-AS
. O

It O
's O
color B-AS
is O
even O
cool O
. O

and O
it O
has O
blue O
screen O
crashed O
on O
me O
twice O
. O

Another O
two O
weeks O
later O
and O
it O
was O
back O
in O
my O
possession O
. O

keys B-AS
are O
all O
in O
weird O
places O
and O
is O
way O
too O
large O
for O
the O
way O
it O
is O
designed B-AS
. O

I O
' O
ve O
owned O
every O
Pro O
model O
Apple O
laptop O
for O
the O
last O
8 O
years O
, O
this O
is O
BY O
FAR O
the O
WORST O
one O
I O
' O
ve O
ever O
had O
. O

We O
purchase O
the O
Dell O
XPS O
several O
years O
ago O
for O
my O
home O
business O
. O

Have O
purchased O
many O
products O
over O
the O
years O
from O
MacConnection O
and O
this O
transaction O
, O
like O
all O
the O
others O
, O
we O
smoothly O
with O
no O
problems O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
anyone O
to O
buy O
from O

. O

Yes O
, O
a O
Mac O
is O
much O
more O
money O
than O
the O
average O
laptop O
out O
there O
, O
but O
there O
is O
no O
comparison O
in O
style B-AS
, O
speed B-AS
and O
just O
cool O
factor O
. O

He O
gave O
me O
this O
PC O
about O
3 O
years O
ago O
and O
up O
to O
this O
point O
i O
m O
still O
sitting O
here O
using O
it O

I O
' O
m O
pleased O
. O

The O
keyboard B-AS
feels O
good O
and O
I O
type O
just O
fine O
on O
it O
. O

With O
a O
healthy O
pessimism O
, O
I O
took O
the O
machine O
home O
and O
tried O
to O
find O
a O
flaw O
. O

Shiny O
This O
Laptop O
is O
the O
Best O
of O
the O
best O
! O

I O
thought O
the O
white O
Mac O

looked O
dirty O
too O
quicly O
where O
you O
use O
the O
mousepad B-AS
and O
where O
you O
place O
your O
hands O
when O
typing O
. O

And O
not O
to O
mention O
after O
using O
it O
for O
a O
few O
months O
or O
so O
, O
the O
battery B-AS
will O
slowly O
less O
and O
less O
hold O
a O
charge O
until O
you O
ca O
n't O
leave O
it O
unplugged O
for O
more O
than O
5 O
minutes O
without O
the O
thing O
dying O
. O

Do O
n't O
waste O
their O
money O
, O
save O
it O
and O
but O
a O
mac O
. O

Money O
and O
time O
well O
spent O
! O

Gradually O
the O
freezing O
screen O
evolved O
into O
a O
screen O
that O
froze O
in O
weird O
shapes O

I O

I O

I O
have O
this O
model O
Toshiba O

no O
complaints O
with O
their O

and O
maybe O
because O
it O
just O
sits O
on O
your O
desktop O

and O
you O
do O
n't O
carry O
it O
around O

which O
could O
jar O
the O
hard B-AS

or O
the O

Yes O
, O
they O
cost O
more O

they O
more O
than O
make O
up O
for O
it O
in O

and O

Since O
I O
keyboard B-AS
over O
100 O
wpm O
, O
I O
look O
for O
a O
unit O
that O
has O
a O

no O

I O
also O
tried O
the O
touch B-AS
pad I-AS
and O
compared O
it O
to O
other O
netbooks O
in O
the O
store O
. O

It O
absolutely O
is O
more O
expensive O
than O
most O
PC O

, O
but O
the O
ease O
of O
use B-AS
, O
security B-AS
, O
and O
minimal O
problems O
that O
have O
arisen O
make O
it O
well O
worth O
the O

It O
gets O
stuck O
all O
of O
the O
time O
you O
use B-AS
it O

you O

! O

Have O
returned O
that O
laptop O
unused O
. O

Will O
probably O
never O
buy O
a O
HP O
again O
. O

I O
got O
tired O
of O
buying O
laptops O
and O
having O
them O
stop O
working O
after O
a O
year O
. O

I O
should O
have O
been O
more O
observant O
. O

I O
wish O
it O
had O
a O
webcam B-AS
though O
, O
then O
it O
would O
be O
perfect O
! O

My O
favorite O
part O
of O
this O
computer O
is O
that O
it O
has O
a O
vga B-AS
port I-AS
so O
I O
can O
connect O
it O
to O
a O
bigger O
screen B-AS
. O

Another O
thing O
I O
might O
add O
is O
the O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
is O
excellent O
. O

One O
drawback O
, O
I O
wish O
the O
keys B-AS
were O
backlit O
. O

When O
the O
buyer O
returned O
it O
Wal O
Mart O
just O
boxed O
it O
, O
taped O
it O
shut O
resold O
it O
as O
new O
. O

What O
a O
great O
little O
laptop O
. O

Acer O
was O
no O
help O
and O
Garmin O
could O
not O
determine O
the O
problemafter O
spending O
about O
2 O
hours O
with O
me O
, O
so O
I O
returned O
it O
and O
purchased O
a O
Toshiba O
R700 O
that O
seems O
even O
nicer O
and O
I O
was O
able O
to O
load O
all O
of O
my O
software B-AS
with O
no O
problem O
. O

I O
wish O
the O
volume B-AS
could O
be O
louder O
and O
the O
mouse B-AS
did O
n't O
break O
after O
only O
a O
month O
. O

I O
play O
a O
lot O
of O
casual O
games O
online O
, O
and O
the O
touchpad B-AS
is O
very O
responsive O
. O

Granted O
, O
it O
's O
still O
a O
very O
new O
laptop O
but O
in O
comparison O
to O
my O
previous O
laptops O
and O
desktops O
, O
my O
Mac O
boots B-AS
up I-AS
noticeably O
quicker O
. O

It O
caught O
a O
virus O
that O
completely O
wiped O
out O
my O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
in O
a O
matter O
of O
hours O
. O

WOULD O
PAY O
MORE O
FOR O
IT O
IF O
I O
HAD O
TOO O
! O

Could O
n't O
keep O
a O
page O
up O
you O
were O
working O
on O
! O

It O
is O
everything O
I O
'd O
hoped O
it O
would O
be O
from O
a O
look B-AS
and I-AS
feel I-AS
standpoint I-AS
, O
but O
somehow O
a O
bit O
more O
sturdy O
. O

the O
only O
fact O
i O
do O
n't O
like O
about O
apples O
is O
they O
generally O
use O
safari B-AS
and O
i O
do O
n't O
use O
safari B-AS
but O
after O
i O
install O
Mozzilla B-AS
firfox I-AS
i O
love O
every O
single O
bit O
about O
it O
. O

The O
Bluetooth B-AS
was O
not O
there O
at O
all O
, O
and O
the O
fingerprint B-AS
reader I-AS
driver I-AS
would O
be O
there O
, O
but O
the O
software B-AS
would O
hang O
after O
installation O
was O
1/2 O
way O
done O
. O

Great O
battery B-AS
, O
speed B-AS
, O
display B-AS
. O

I O
would O
not O
recommend O
this O
product O
to O
anyone O
. O

I O
like O
to O
use O
it O
at O
the O
race O
track O
to O
handiecap O
the O
horse O
races O
. O

I O
was O
given O
a O
Mac O
as O
a O
birthday O
present O
and O
could O
n't O
be O
happier O
with O
it O
3 O
years O
later O
. O

The O
delivery B-AS
was O
fast O
, O
and O
I O
would O
not O
hesitate O
to O
purchase O
this O
laptop O
again O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
been O
impressed O
with O
the O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
and O
the O
performance B-AS
for O
such O
a O
small O
amount O
of O
memory B-AS
. O

do O
a O
quick O
search O
on O
the O
internet O
see O
if O
i O
m O
the O
only O
one O
. O

I O
' O
m O
extremely O
happy O
with O
my O
purchase O
as O
I O
now O
have O
the O
portable O
power O
I O
have O
been O
looking O
for O
. O

It O
's O
applications B-AS
are O
terrific O
, O
including O
the O
replacements O
for O
Microsoft B-AS
office I-AS
. O

they O
improved O
nothing O
else O
such O
as O
Resolution B-AS
, O
appearance B-AS
, O
cooling B-AS
system I-AS
, O
graphics B-AS
card I-AS
, O
etc O
. O

I O
got O
it O
back O
and O
my O
built B-AS
- I-AS
in I-AS
webcam I-AS
and O
built B-AS
- I-AS
in I-AS
mic I-AS
were O
shorting O
out O
anytime O
I O
touched O
the O
lid O
, O
mind O
you O
this O
was O
my O
means O
of O
communication O
with O
my O
fiance O
who O
was O
deployed O
but O
I O
suffered O
thru O
it O
and O
would O
constandly O
have O
to O
reset O
the O
computer O
to O
be O
able O
to O
use O
my O
cam B-AS
and O
mic B-AS
anytime O
they O
went O
out O
. O

Is O
this O
partially O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
is O
running O
Windows B-AS
Vista I-AS
? O

You O
might O
think O
, O
I O
am O
new O
in O
this O
game O
, O
but O
I O
am O
a O
gadget O
lover O
, O
and O
have O
had O
more O
than O
2 O
dozens O
laptops O
in O
the O
past O
15 O
years O
, O
and O
none O
gets O
this O
hot O
, O
that O
fast O
. O

I O
was O
informed O
that O
I O
need O
to O
call O
some O
0900 O
number O
first O
. O

I O
really O
wanted O
a O
Mac O
over O
a O
pc O
because O
I O
used O
a O
Mac O
in O
high O
school O
. O

1 O
Payed O
$ O
2200 O
for O
a O
premium O
laptop O

I O
BOUGHT O
THEM O
FOR O
MY O
COLLEGE O
AGE O
GRANDCHILDREN O
AND O
THESE O
MACS O
ARE O
TOTALLY O
RELIABLE O
AND O
SUPPORT O
THEIR O
CLASS O
WORK O
100 O
% O
OF O
THE O
TIME O
. O

The O
board B-AS
has O
a O
bad O
connector B-AS
with O
the O
power B-AS
supply I-AS
and O
shortly O
after O
warrenty B-AS
expires O
the O
power B-AS
supply I-AS
will O
start O
having O
issues O
. O

Do O
not O
purchase O
this O
laptop O
. O

My O
dad O
has O
one O
of O
the O
very O
first O
Toshibas O
ever O
made O
, O
yes O
its O
abit O
slow O
now O
but O
still O
works B-AS
well O
and O
i O
hooked O
to O
my O
ethernet B-AS
! O

Mostly O
I O
love O
the O
drag B-AS
and I-AS
drop I-AS
feature I-AS
. O

oh O
yeah O
, O
and O
if O
the O
fancy O
webcam B-AS
breaks O
guess O
who O
you O
have O
to O
send O
it O
to O
to O
get O
it O
fixed O
? O

She O
brought O
out O
2 O
other O
identical O
netbooks O
and O
still O
insist O
that O
It O
is O
like O
that O
one O
. O

I O
ordered O
through O
MacMall O
, O
which O
saved O
me O
the O
sales B-AS
tax I-AS
I O
would O
have O
incurred O
buying O
locally O
. O

Very O
fast O
and O
efficient O
! O

Of O
course O
, O
I O
also O
have O
several O
great O
software B-AS
packages I-AS
that O
came O
for O
free O
including O
iWork B-AS
, O
GarageBand B-AS
, O
and O
iMovie B-AS
. O

Being O
virus O
- O
resistant O
is O
a O
huge O
plus O
. O

The O
screen B-AS
is O
very O
large O
and O
crystal O
clear O
with O
amazing O
colors B-AS
and O
resolution B-AS
. O

After O
a O
little O
more O
than O
a O
year O
of O
owning O
my O
MacBook O
Pro O
, O
the O
monitor B-AS
has O
completely O
died O
. O

In O
my O
house O
, O
HP O
is O
a O
nasty O
word O
. O

The O
brand O
of O
iTunes B-AS
has O
just O
become O
ingrained O
in O
our O
lexicon O
now O
, O
but O
keep O
in O
mind O
that O
Apple O
started O
it O
all O
. O

By O
the O
way O
teachers O
, O
they O
offer O
a O
discount O
which O
helps O
! O

now O
he O
mows O
yards O
so O
he O
can O
earn O
the O
money O
for O
the O
wireless O
internet O
. O

I O
still O
see O
the O
benefits O
of O
a O
PC O
when O
I O
do O
not O
know O
how O
to O
do O
something O
on O
my O
mac O
. O

Size B-AS
, O
I O
know O
13 O
is O
small O
especially O
for O
a O
desktop O
replacement O
but O
with O
an O
external B-AS
monitor I-AS
, O
who O
cares O
. O

Additional O
caveat O
, O
the O
base B-AS
installation I-AS
comes O
with O
some O
Toshiba O
- O
specific O
software B-AS
that O
may O
or O
may O
not O
be O
to O
a O
user O
's O
liking O
. O

It O
is O
held O
in O
place O
magnetically O
. O

Taking O
it O
back O
to O
Best O
Buy O
I O
found O
that O
a O
tiny O
plastic O
piece O
inside O
had O
broken O
manuf B-AS
issue O
. O

It O
has O
no O
camera O
but O
, O
I O
can O
always O
buy O
and O
install O
one O
easy O
. O

The O
display B-AS
is O
incredibly O
bright O
, O
much O
brighter O
than O
my O
PowerBook O
and O
very O
crisp O
. O

We O
were O
PC O
users O
. O

The O
AMD B-AS
Turin I-AS
processor I-AS
seems O
to O
always O
perform O
so O
much O
better O
than O
Intel B-AS
. O

After O
that O
the O
said O
it O
was O
under O
warranty B-AS
. O

The O
start B-AS
menu I-AS
is O
not O
the O
easiest O
thing O
to O
navigate B-AS
due O
to O
the O
stacking O
. O

Only O
thing O
I O
would O
want O
to O
add O
to O
this O
is O
an O
internal O
bluray B-AS
read I-AS
/ I-AS
write I-AS
drive I-AS
. O

This O
computer O
was O
awful O
, O
I O
would O
never O
recomend O
it O
to O
another O
person O
. O

The O
service B-AS
tech I-AS
said O
he O
had O
tried O
to O
duplicate O
the O
damage O
and O
was O
n't O
able O
to O
recreate O
it O
therefore O
it O
had O
to O
be O
their O
defect O
. O

The O
tech B-AS
store I-AS
I O
purchased O
this O
from O
sent O
it O
back O
, O
, O
, O
, O
, O
eventually O
I O
got O
a O
new O
or O
repaired O
machine O
approximately O
3 O
weeks O
later O
. O

I O
loved O
it O
then O
, O
but O
unfortunately O
it O
was O
before O
the O
days O
of O
wireless O
internet O
. O

Really O
like O
the O
textured O
surface B-AS
which O
shows O
no O
fingerprints O
. O

I O
WILL O
NEVER O
AGAIN O
buy O
another O
Acer O
, O
not O
will O
I O
buy O
Gateway O
, O
or O
eMachine O
as O
they O
are O
all O
from O
the O
same O
company O
. O

The O
screen B-AS
is O
bright O
and O
the O
keyboard B-AS
is O
nice O
; O

I O
look O
forward O
to O
years O
of O
use O
, O
it O
has O
held O
up O
well O
over O
the O
years O
and O
it O
fits O
my O
needs O
very O
well O
. O

I O
m O
very O
happy O
with O
this O
computer O
! O

But O
the O
machine O
is O
awesome O
and O
iLife B-AS
is O
great O
and O
I O
love O
Snow B-AS
Leopard I-AS
X I-AS
. O

High O
price B-AS
tag I-AS
, O
however O
. O

I O
thought O
learning O
the O
Mac B-AS
OS I-AS
would O
be O
hard O
, O
but O
it O
is O
easily O
picked O
up O
if O
you O
are O
familiar O
with O
a O
PC O
. O

My O
kids O
have O
to O
take O
their O
PCs O
in O
once O
a O
year O
to O
have O
them O
de O
- O
bugged O
. O

I O
had O
static O
in O
the O
output O
, O
and O
I O
had O
to O
reduce O
the O
sound B-AS
output I-AS
quality I-AS
to O
FM O
as O
opposed O
to O
the O
default O
CD O
. O

It O
was O
a O
laugh O
too O
! O

Since O
I O
purchased O
my O
Toshiba O
netbook O
, O
I O
have O
been O
very O
pleased O
with O
it O
, O
I O
have O
a O
laptob O
and O
a O
desktop O
. O

I O
bought O
my O
macbook O
a O
few O
months O
ago O
and O
it O
has O
been O
my O
baby O
ever O
since O
. O

That O
is O
how O
it O
is O
able O
to O
function O
better O
than O
any O
other O
PC O
. O

I O
custom O
ordered O
the O
machine O
from O
HP O
and O
could O
NOT O
understand O
the O
techie B-AS
due O
to O
his O
accent O
. O

It O
is O
easy O
to O
use B-AS
and O
lightweight O
. O

I O
went O
to O
Toshiba B-AS
online I-AS
help I-AS
and O
found O
some O
suggestions O
to O
fix O
it O
. O

It O
is O
a O
bit O
heavy O
. O

after O
trying O
to O
get O
some O
help O
he O
disconnected O
on O
me O
. O

They O
also O
have O
a O
longer O
service B-AS
life I-AS
than O
other O
computers O
I O
have O
several O
friends O
who O
still O
use O
the O
older O
Apple O
PowerBooks O
. O

If O
you O
check O
you O
will O
find O
the O
same O
notebook O
with O
the O
above O
missing O
ports B-AS
and O
a O
dual O
core O
AMD O
or O
Intel O
processor B-AS
. O

This O
laptop O
is O
a O
great O
price B-AS
and O
has O
a O
sleek O
look B-AS
. O

I O
especially O
like O
the O
keyboard B-AS
which O
has O
chiclet O
type O
keys B-AS
. O

Small O
screen O
somewhat O
limiting O
but O
great O
for O
travel O
. O

One O
of O
the O
primary O
reasons O
why O
I O
purchased O
an O
IPad O
was O
to O
store O
photographs O
so O
that O
I O
could O
show O
to O
my O
customers O
. O

Runs O
Hot O
I O
thought O
we O
were O
paying O
for O
quality B-AS
in O
our O
decision O
to O
buy O
an O
Apple O
product O
. O

For O
the O
not O
so O
good O
, O
I O
got O
the O
stock B-AS
screen I-AS
, O
which O
is O
VERY O
glossy O
. O

The O
gray B-AS
color I-AS
was O
a O
good O
choice O
. O

This O
was O
the O
second O
computer O
and O
brand O
bought O
that O
day O
. O

Buy O
this O
. O

VERY O
disappointing O
, O

I O
love O
this O
product O
because O
it O
is O
Toshiba O
and O
its O
156 O
. O

I O
would O
like O
to O
have O
volume B-AS
buttons I-AS
rather O
than O
the O
adjustment O
that O
is O
on O
the O
front O
. O

This O
is O
my O
first O
computer O
purchase O

People O
know O
what O
they O
are O
talking O
about O
and O
they O
have O
pride O
in O
the O
product O
that O
they O
are O
selling O
. O

The O
processor B-AS
a O
AMD O
Semprom O
at O
21 O
ghz O
is O
a O
bummer O
it O
does O
not O
have O
the O
power O
for O
HD O
or O
heavy O
computing B-AS
. O

Would O
HIGHLY O
recommend O
this O
netbook O
though O
. O

I O
have O
had O
several O
machines O
over O
the O
years O
, O
both O
for O
personal O
and O
business O
use O
. O

I O
bought O
a O
protector B-AS
for O
my O
key B-AS
pad I-AS
and O
it O
works O
great O
, O

The O
magnetic B-AS
plug I-AS
- I-AS
in I-AS
power I-AS
charging I-AS
power I-AS
cord I-AS
is O
great O
I O
even O
put O
it O
to O
the O
test O
by O
accident O
excellent O
innovation O
! O

Well O
i O
got O
this O
computer O
from O
Best O
Buy O
and O
I O
have O
had O
nothing O
but O
problems O
I O
bought O
the O
computer O
with O
a O
virus O
. O

It O
seems O
they O
could O
have O
updated O
XP B-AS
and O
done O
without O
creating O
Vista B-AS
. O

It O
is O
easy O
to O
use B-AS
, O
fast O
and O
has O
great O
graphics B-AS
for O
the O
money O
. O

I O
decided O
I O
wanted O
a O
laptop O
so O
I O
went O
into O
the O
BBY O
store O
. O

I O
like O
how O
the O
Mac B-AS
OS I-AS
is O
so O
simple O
and O
easy O
to O
use B-AS
. O

While O
Apple O
's O
saving O
grace O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
they O
at O
least O
stand O
behind O
their O
products O
, O
and O
their O
support B-AS
is O
great O
, O
it O
would O
be O
nice O
if O
their O
products O
were O
more O
reliable O
to O
justify O
the O
premium O
. O

In O
the O
three O
years O
I O
' O
ve O
had O
my O
MacBook O
Pro O
, O
I O
have O
never O
had O
a O
virus O
on O
my O
computer O
, O
and O
I O
do O
a O
lot O
of O
work O
on O
the O
internet O
. O

I O
was O
ready O
to O
take O
it O
back O
for O
a O
refund O
, O
but O
the O
Geek B-AS
Squad I-AS
camed O
through O
and O
pointed O
me O
in O
the O
right O
direction O
to O
get O
it O
fixed O
. O

I O
have O
had O
laptops O
in O
the O
past O
and O
I O
thought O
why O
not O
give O
these O
small O
netbooks O
a O
try O
. O

It O
ca O
n't O
get O
any O
better O
. O

All O
the O
problems O
I O
have O
had O
with O
PC O
's O
are O
solved O
with O
a O
Mac O
, O
the O
issue O
of O
overheating O
- O
my O
Dell O
was O
always O
overheating O
and O
not O
working O
properly O
or O
simply O
shutting O
off O
, O
and O
the O
issue O
of O
viruses O
and O
contaminants O
- O
my O
HP O
completely O
quit O
working O
within2 O
years O
of O
purchasing O
it O
, O
with O
no O
inexpensive O
way O
of O
fixing O
it O
. O

only O
good O
thing O
is O
the O
graphics B-AS
quality I-AS
. O

The O
other O
lock O
- O
up O
problems O
are O
from O
a O
myriad O
of O
causes O
, O
the O
most O
common O
being O
a O
corrupted O
version O
of O
Appleworks B-AS
which O
can O
render O
the O
browser B-AS
useless O
. O

In O
short O
I O
would O
never O
buy O
a O
Compaq O
again O
. O

I O
love O
the O
15 O
MacBook O
Pro O
. O

breaks O
easily O
. O

The O
paint B-AS
wears O
off O
easily O
due O
to O
the O
keyboard B-AS
being O
farther O
back O
than O
usual O
. O

That O
's O
right O
, O
no O
power O
, O
absolutely O
NOTHING O
. O

I O
had O
purchased O
it O
from O
a O
major O
electronics O
store O
and O
took O
it O
to O
their O
service B-AS
department I-AS
to O
find O
out O
what O
the O
problem O
was O
. O

The O
store O
honored O
their O
warrenty B-AS
and O
made O
the O
comment O
that O
they O
do O
n't O
even O
recommend O
the O
HP O
brand O
because O
of O
the O
problems O
with O
their O
warrenty B-AS
. O

But O
I O
was O
wrong O
. O

NO O
good O
. O

I O
always O
use O
a O
backup O
hard B-AS
disk I-AS
to O
store O
important O
files O
at O
all O
times O
. O

They O
sent O
out O
the O
box O
right O
away O
for O
me O
to O
send O
in O
my O
computer O
, O
they O
paid O
postage O
and O
whatnot O
, O
but O
when O
I O
got O
my O
computer O
back O
it O
still O
was O
n't O
running B-AS
right O
, O
and O
now O
my O
CD B-AS
drive I-AS
was O
n't O
reading O
anything O
! O

I O
bought O
this O
laptop O
Was O
the O
worst O
Laptop O
I O
' O
ve O
ever O
bought O
. O

But O
the O
screen B-AS
size I-AS
is O
not O
that O
bad O
for O
email O
and O
web B-AS
browsing I-AS
. O

Once O
I O
removed O
all O
the O
software B-AS
the O
laptop O
loads B-AS
in O
15 O
- O
20 O
seconds O
. O

On O
my O
PowerBook O
G4 O
I O
would O
never O
use O
the O
trackpad B-AS
I O
would O
use O
an O
external B-AS
mouse I-AS
because O
I O
did O
n't O
like O
the O
trackpad B-AS
. O

This O
computer O
does O
n't O
do O
that O
well O
with O
certain O
games B-AS
it O
ca O
n't O
play O
some O
and O
it O
becomes O
too O
hot O
while O
playing O
games B-AS
. O

Obviously O
one O
of O
the O
most O
important O
features B-AS
of O
any O
computer O
is O
the O
human B-AS
interface I-AS
. O

Yeah O
, O
of O
course O
smarty O
pants O
fix O
it O
nowASPECT1 O
, O
Compared O
to O
the O
early O
2011 O
edition O
I O
did O
see O
inbuilt B-AS
applications I-AS
crashing O
and O
it O
prompted O
me O
to O
send O
the O
report O
to O
Apple O
which O
I O
promptly O
did O
. O

The O
body B-AS
is O
a O
bit O
cheaply O
made O
so O
it O
will O
be O
interesting O
to O
see O
how O
long O
it O
holds O
up O
. O

The O
i5 B-AS
blows O
my O
desktop O
out O
of O
the O
water O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
rendering O
videos O
. O

With O
a O
mac O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
antivirus B-AS
software I-AS
or O
firewall B-AS
, O
it O
's O
so O
wonderful O
. O

For O
the O
use O
it O
was O
purchased O
for O
it O
is O
a O
good O
Laptop O
. O

Am O
very O
glad O
I O
bought O
it O
, O
great O
netbook O
, O
low O
price B-AS
. O

Obviously O
, O
this O
Macbook O
is O
P O
- O
E O
- O
R O
- O
F O
- O
E O
- O
C O
- O
T O
for O
me O
because O
it O
does O
exactly O
what O
I O
need O
in O
an O
easy O
- O
to O
- O
function O
way O
. O

Worth O
the O
investment O
and O
truly O
a O
fine O
piece O
of O
equipment O
. O

The O
Apple B-AS
team I-AS
also O
assists O
you O
very O
nicely O
when O
choosing O
which O
computer O
is O
right O
for O
you O
, O

Summary O
, O
Do O
nt O
buy O
HP O
. O

I O
think O
part O
of O
the O
problem O
with O
this O
computer O
is O
Vista B-AS
, O
yet O
I O
know O
Vista B-AS
is O
n't O
the O
entire O
issue O
because O
my O
latest O
purchase O
was O
my O
Acer O
and O
it O
also O
has O
Vista B-AS
I O
should O
have O
waited O
the O
few O
months O
to O
get O
the O
next O
operating B-AS
system I-AS
. O

The O
video B-AS
chat I-AS
is O
the O
only O
thing O
that O
is O
iffy O
about O
it O
but O
i O
m O
sure O
once O
they O
unpdate O
the O
next O
version O
on O
the O
macbook O
book O
the O
quality O
of O
it O
will O
be O
better O
. O

You O
'll O
need O
to O
upgrade O
and O
pay O
a O
little O
more O
for O
them O
. O

it O
is O
hard O
to O
fix O
and O
makes O
it O
a O
hassle O
to O
own O
one O
. O

That O
whole O
experience O
was O
just O
ridiculous O
we O
sent O
it O
in O
and O
after O
they O
told O
us O
that O
we O
had O
to O
pay O
$ O
175 O
to O
fix O
it O
we O
were O
like O
we O
will O
just O
by O
a O
portable O
mouse B-AS
which O
would O
be O
way O
cheaper O
but O
they O
refused O
to O
send O
the O
laptop O
back O
until O
we O
paid O
the O
$ O
175 O
and O
it O
was O
fixed O
. O

Macs O
are O
designed O
for O
the O
frontal O
lobe O
challenged O
people O
out O
there O
. O

Fan B-AS
vents O
to O
the O
side O
, O
so O
no O
cooling B-AS
pad I-AS
needed O
, O
great O
feature B-AS
! O

i O
use O
my O
mac O
all O
the O
time O
, O
i O
love O
the O
software B-AS
, O
the O
way O
it O
takes O
a O
short O
time O
to O
load O
things O
, O
how O
easy O
it O
is O
to O
use O
and O
most O
of O
all O
how O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
viruses O
. O

Wasted O
me O
at O
least O
8 O
hours O
of O
installation B-AS
time I-AS
. O

It O
has O
far O
exceeded O
my O
expectations O
for O
power B-AS
, O
storage B-AS
, O
and O
abilitiy B-AS
. O

A O
great O
feature B-AS
is O
the O
spotlight B-AS
search I-AS
, O
one O
can O
search O
for O
documents O
by O
simply O
typing O
a O
keyword O
, O
rather O
than O
parsing O
tens O
of O
file O
folders O
for O
a O
document O
. O

My O
wireless B-AS
system I-AS
would O
not O
recognize O
Windows B-AS
7 I-AS
and O
I O
could O
n't O
get O
online O
to O
find O
out O
why O
. O

I O
am O
enjoying O
it O
and O
the O
quality B-AS
it O
provides O
is O
great O
! O

It O
is O
the O
worst O
laptop O
ever O

Suffice O
it O
to O
say O
, O
my O
MacBook O
Pro O
keeps O
me O
going O
with O
its O
long O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
and O
blazing O
speed B-AS
. O

I O
' O
m O
not O
going O
to O
lie O
, O
I O
' O
ve O
never O
really O
liked O
the O
Acer O
brand O
in O
general O
. O

The O
OS B-AS
is O
also O
very O
user O
friendly O
, O
even O
for O
those O
that O
switch O
from O
a O
PC O
, O
with O
a O
little O
practice O
you O
can O
take O
full O
advantage O
of O
this O
OS B-AS
! O

iTunes B-AS
is O
a O
handy O
music O
- O
management O
program B-AS
, O
and O
it O
is O
essential O
for O
anyone O
with O
an O
iPod O
. O

-I O
give O
up O
on O
my O
data O
, O
I O
just O
want O
a O
computer O
reasonably O
fast O
. O

Would O
buy O
100 O
more O
of O
these O
if O
I O
could O
. O

while O
it O
was O
barely O
a O
bargin O
in O
the O
begining O
, O
i O
would O
never O
purchase O
another O
dell O
and O
would O
not O
recomend O
the O
dell O
brand O
to O
others O
. O

it O
was O
shooting O
sparks O
! O

Great O
product O
. O

Mac O
is O
not O
made O
for O
gaming B-AS
. O

Well O
I O
spilled O
something O
on O
it O
and O
they O
replaced O
it O
with O
this O
model O
, O
which O
gets O
hot O
and O
the O
battery B-AS
does O
n't O
make O
it O
through O
1 O
DVD O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
had O
to O
call O
Apple B-AS
support I-AS
to O
set O
up O
my O
new O
printer O
and O
have O
had O
wonderful O
experiences O
with O
helpful O
, O
english O
speaking O
from O
Vancouver O
techs B-AS
that O
walked O
me O
through O
the O
processes O
to O
help O
me O
. O

But O
Sony O
said O
we O
could O
send O
it O
back O
and O
be O
charged O
for O
adding B-AS
the I-AS
bluetooth I-AS
an O
additional O
seventy O
something O
dollars O
. O

By O
this O
time O
I O
was O
regretting O
ever O
SEEING O
this O
machine O
on O
the O
shelf O
! O

Toshiba O
is O
a O
great O
brand O
, O
even O
though O
I O
have O
n't O
had O
it O
for O
a O
long O
time O
, O
I O
am O
very O
happy O
with O
it O
! O

I O
need O
graphic B-AS
power I-AS
to O
run O
my O
Adobe B-AS
Creative I-AS
apps I-AS
efficiently O
. O

the O
programs B-AS
are O
esay O
to O
use B-AS
and O
are O
quick O
to O
process O
this O
computer O
works O
like O
a O
charm O
. O

The O
materials B-AS
that O
came O
with O
the O
computer O
did O
not O
include O
the O
right O
# O
anywhere O
. O

So O
when O
you O
do O
call O
to O
complain O
about O
the O
hunk O
of O
metal O
you O
get O
the O
joy O
of O
speaking O
with O
a O
bunch O
of O
people O
you O
ca O
n't O
understand O
. O

That O
day O
! O

For O
one O
, O
I O
noticed O
that O
from O
turning O
on O
my O
mac O
to O
logging O
on O
only O
took O
about O
25 O
seconds O
. O

It O
does O
not O
even O
have O
the O
software B-AS
to O
play O
a O
dvd O
now O
. O

My O
brother O
is O
a O
computer O
wiz O
and O
would O
laugh O
at O
me O
because O
he O
used O
an O
Apple O
. O

Tech B-AS
support I-AS
tells O
me O
the O
latter O
problem O
is O
a O
power B-AS
supply I-AS
problem O
and O
have O
offered O
to O
fix O
it O
if O
it O
happens O
again O
. O

Since O
I O
never O
really O
got O
to O
use O
this O
, O
I O
ca O
n't O
comment O
on O
anything O
except O
what O
went O
wrong O
after O
trying O
2 O
of O
them O
. O

Buyers O
beware O
. O

HOW O
DOES O
THE O
POWER B-AS
SUPPLY I-AS
NOT O
WORK O
! O
! O
! O

Sells O
for O
the O
same O
as O
a O
netbook O
without O
sacrificing O
size B-AS
. O

I O
'll O
rather O
be O
out O
of O
date O
then O
spend O
more O
money O
on O
toshiba O
. O

upon O
giving O
them O
the O
serial O
number O
the O
first O
thing O
I O
was O
told O
, O
was O
that O
it O
was O
out O
of O
warranty B-AS
and O
I O
could O
pay O
to O
have O
it O
repaired O
. O

Windows B-AS
XP I-AS
SP2 I-AS
caused O
many O
problems O
on O
the O
computer O
, O
so O
I O
had O
to O
remove O
it O
. O

Love O
it O
. O

I O
reloaded O
with O
Windows B-AS
7 I-AS
Ultimate I-AS
, O
and O
the O
Bluetooth B-AS
and O
Fingerprint B-AS
reader I-AS
software I-AS
would O
not O
load O
. O

None O
of O
the O
techs B-AS
at I-AS
HP I-AS
knew O
what O
they O
were O
doing O
. O

Oh O
, O
it O
is O
such O
a O
great O
piece O
of O
equipment O
. O

this O
is O
my O
second O
one O
and O
the O
same O
problem O
, O
bad O
video B-AS
card I-AS
unreliable O
overall O
, O
this O
will O
be O
my O
second O
time O
returning O
this O
laptop O
back O
to O
best O
buy O
. O

I O
use O
that O
alot O
on O
my O
desktop O
, O
so O
I O
am O
adjusting O
to O
not O
having O
it O
. O

With O
awesome O
graphics B-AS
and O
assuring O
security B-AS
, O
it O
's O
perfect O
! O

Laptop O
was O
in O
new O
condition O
and O
operational O
, O
but O
for O
the O
audio B-AS
problem O
when O
1st O
sent O
for O
repair O
. O

I O
was O
disappointed O
when O
I O
realized O
that O
the O
keyboard B-AS
does O
n't O
light O
up O
on O
this O
model O
. O

This O
machine O
was O
a O
horrible O
experience O
. O

It O
runs B-AS
perfectly O
. O

Very O
dissappointed O
becase O
I O
have O
had O
toshibas O
for O
years O
, O
and O
never O
a O
issue O
. O

If O
you O
have O
any O
creativity O
in O
you O
do O
yourself O
a O
favor O
and O
get O
a O
mac O
! O

The O
laptop O
was O
very O
easy O
to O
set B-AS
up I-AS
. O

Congratulations O
Asus O
for O
creating O
one O
big O
piece O
of O
dump O
which O
is O
my O
laptop O
. O

Sometimes O
the O
screen B-AS
even O
goes O
black O
on O
this O
computer O
. O

I O
would O
definitely O
recommend O
checking O
out O
this O
laptop O
if O
you O
are O
in O
the O
market O
for O
one O
. O

I O
recommend O
for O
word B-AS
processing I-AS
and O
internet B-AS
users O
. O

Since O
I O
' O
ve O
had O
this O
computer O
I O
' O
ve O
only O
used O
the O
trackpad B-AS
because O
it O
is O
so O
nice O
and O
smooth O
. O

When O
the O
computer O
has O
been O
on O
for O
several O
minutes O
, O
it O
will O
occasionaly O
just O
go O
off O
by O
itself O
. O

A O
longer O
battery O
life O
would O
have O
been O
great O
, O
but O
it O
meets O
it O
's O
spec B-AS
quite O
easily O
. O

Who O
could O
n't O
love O
a O
DVD B-AS
burner I-AS
, O
80-gigabyte O
HD B-AS
, O
and O
fairly O
new O
graphics B-AS
chip I-AS
? O
As O
I O
soon O
discovered O
, O
though O
, O
there O
is O
a O
reason O
for O
which O
similarly O
- O
configured O
Sony O
and O
Toshiba O
machines O
cost O
more O
, O
they O
use O
higher O
- O
quality O
components B-AS
that O
are O
faster O
, O
better O
- O
configured O
, O
and O
end O
up O
lasting O
a O
lot O
longer O
. O

falls O
into O
the O
case O
. O

This O
is O
something O
i O
would O
deffinately O
reccomend O
to O
someone O
. O

Its O
fast O
and O
another O
thing O
I O
like O
is O
that O
it O
has O
three O
USB B-AS
ports I-AS
. O

Mac O
computers O
automatically O
defrag O
each O
time O
you O
start O
your O
computer O
. O

That O
is O
my O
only O
complaint O
! O

The O
salesman O
talked O
us O
into O
this O
computer O
away O
from O
another O
we O
were O
looking O
at O
and O
we O
have O
had O
nothing O
but O
problems O
with O
software B-AS
problems O
and O
just O
not O
happy O
with O
it O
. O

That O
system B-AS
is O
fixed O
. O

The O
computer O
itself O
was O
fast O
, O
ran B-AS
smoothly O
, O
and O
had O
no O
problems O
. O

One O
of O
the O
smartest O
thing O
I O
did O
was O
take O
my O
time O
to O
compare O
laptops O
before O
making O
my O
purchase O
. O

Like O
the O
price B-AS
and O
operation B-AS
. O

The O
brand B-AS
is O
tarnished O
in O
my O
heart O
. O

This O
is O
likely O
due O
to O
poor O
grounding O
and O
isolation O
between O
the O
components B-AS
, O
and O
I O
' O
m O
hoping O
that O
it O
can O
be O
fixed O
with O
a O
ground B-AS
loop I-AS
isolator I-AS
, O
but O
I O
still O
expected O
better O
product O
quality B-AS
for O
this O
price B-AS
range I-AS
. O

Honestly O
, O
this O
is O
absolutely O
wonderful O
. O

I O
have O
had O
it O
for O
about O
a O
1 O
1/2 O
and O
yes O
I O
have O
had O
an O
issue O
with O
it O
one O
month O
out O
of O
warranty B-AS
. O

I O
really O
wish O
I O
had O
done O
this O
years O
ago O
. O

Well O
, O
maybe O
I O
was O
just O
very O
unlucky O
. O

For O
example O
, O
when O
my O
husband O
turns O
the O
light O
out O
while O
I O
' O
m O
on O
the O
computer O
. O

Once O
open O
, O
the O
leading B-AS
edge I-AS
is O
razor O
sharp O
. O

Loaded O
with O
bloatware B-AS
. O

If O
you O
buy O
, O
pray O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
major O
prolems O
. O

Do O
n't O
get O
me O
wrong O
, O
I O
am O
no O
Microsoft O
hater O
, O
I O
' O
ve O
just O
managed O
to O
turn O
into O
a O
much O
bigger O
Apple O
fan O
because O
of O
this O
machine O
. O

HP O
refused O
to O
give O
me O
a O
new O
one O
and O
Wal O
Mart O
refused O
to O
take O
it O
back O
. O

Within O
3 O
weeks O
the O
same O
issues O
started O
happening O
AGAIN O
. O

Maximum B-AS
sound I-AS
is O
n't O
nearly O
as O
loud O
as O
it O
should O
be O
. O

Well O
, O
they O
do O
n't O
care O
a O
bunch O
. O

I O
loaded O
windows B-AS
7 I-AS
via O
Bootcamp B-AS
and O
it O
works O
flawlessly O
! O

I O
have O
never O
had O
to O
shut O
down O
the O
computer O
unexpectedly O
and O
the O
computer O
has O
never O
froze O
on O
me O
. O

Great O
Laptop O
for O
the O
price B-AS
, O
works B-AS
well O
with O
action B-AS
pack I-AS
games I-AS
. O

Although O
the O
price B-AS
is O
higher O
then O
Dell O
laptops O
, O
the O
Macbooks O
are O
worth O
the O
dough O
. O

Recommended O
to O
people O
as O
their O
first O
laptop O
. O

I O
would O
recomend O
this O
acer O
to O
parents O
and O
grandparents O
it O
can O
really O
help O
them O
in O
school O
. O

I O
would O
not O
recommend O
this O
to O
anyone O
wanting O
a O
notebook O
expecting O
the O
performance B-AS
of O
a O
Desktop O
it O
does O
not O
meet O
the O
expectations O
. O

The O
Macbook O
arrived O
in O
a O
nice O
twin B-AS
packing I-AS
and O
sealed O
in O
the O
box O
, O
all O
the O
functions B-AS
works O
great O
. O

So O
what O
if O
the O
laptops O
/ O
mobile O
phones O
look B-AS
chic O
and O
cool O
? O
The O
after B-AS
sales I-AS
support I-AS
is O
terrible O
. O

they O
have O
not O
sent O
a O
new O
one O
nor O
called O
. O

I O
would O
easly O
reccomend O
this O
laptop O
to O
a O
friend O
. O

I O
hate O
the O
display B-AS
screen I-AS
and O
I O
have O
done O
everything O
I O
could O
do O
the O
change O
it O
. O

I O
spent O
alot O
of O
money O
on O
this O
product O
and O
its O
been O
a O
nightmare O
. O

I O
also O
like O
the O
acer B-AS
arcade I-AS
but O
these O
were O
reallythe O
only O
two O
things O
I O
liked O
about O
this O
laptop O
. O

Have O
not O
yet O
needed O
any O
customer B-AS
support I-AS
with O
this O
yet O
so O
to O
me O
that O
is O
a O
great O
thing O
, O
which O
is O
leaps O
and O
bounds O
ahead O
of O
PC O
in O
my O
opinion O
. O

Thinking O
about O
returning O
it O

I O
gave O
it O
to O
my O
daughter O
because O
I O
just O
hated O
the O
screen B-AS
, O
hated O
that O
it O
had O
no O
cd B-AS
drive I-AS
to O
at O
least O
play O
cd O
's O
when O
I O
wanted O
to O
listen O
to O
music O
and O
do O
schoolwork O
. O

It O
runs B-AS
very O
quiet O
too O
which O
is O
a O
plus O
. O

but O
it O
has O
a O
major O
design B-AS
flaw O
. O

I O
took O
the O
laptop O
home O
and O
not O
even O
a O
month O
later O
, O
I O
began O
to O
have O
problems O
with O
it O
. O

It O
was O
heavy O
, O
bulky O
, O
and O
hard O
to O
carry O
because O
of O
the O
size B-AS
. O

That O
was O
my O
first O
Apple O
product O
and O
since O
then O
I O
have O
been O
incredibly O
happy O
with O
every O
product O
of O
theirs O
I O
have O
bought O
. O

i O
tried O
turning O
it O
done O
but O
it O
did O
nothing O
. O

It O
is O
super O
fast O
, O
and O
always O
loads O
. O

The O
games B-AS
included O
are O
very O
good O
games B-AS
. O

this O
computer O
will O
last O
you O
at O
least O
7 O
years O
, O
that O
s O
an O
amazing O
life B-AS
spanned O
an O
electronic O
. O

I O
bought O
mine O
from O
Apple O
Store O
the O
day O
it O
was O
released O
as O
Amazon O
did O
n't O
have O
it O
yet O
. O

I O
had O
something O
else O
go O
wrong O
and O
they O
said O
it O
had O
to O
be O
in O
good O
working O
order O
to O
be O
able O
to O
buy O
the O
warranty B-AS
. O

the O
whole O
experiece O
is O
horrible O
so O
save O
up O
and O
buy O
a O
better O
laptop O
. O

I O
just O
bought O
this O
laptop O
3 O
days O
ago O
. O

I O
am O
very O
pleased O
with O
my O
purchase O
! O

Sometimes O
you O
really O
have O
to O
tap O
the O
pad B-AS
to O
get O
it O
to O
worki O

It O
's O
super O
fast O
and O
a O
great O
value B-AS
for O
the O
price B-AS
! O

Three O
, O
the O
mac O
book O
has O
advantages O
over O
pcs O
with O
linux B-AS
based I-AS
os I-AS
there O
is O
very O
few O
problems O
with O
system B-AS
performance I-AS
when O
it O
comes O
to O
a O
mac O
. O

A O
mac O
is O
very O
easy O
to O
use B-AS
and O
it O
simply O
makes O
sense O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
eMachines O
can O
not O
be O
made O
entirely O
to O
blame O
for O
this O
computer O
's O
woes O
; O

however O
, O
I O
may O
have O
inadvertently O
thrown O
out O
one O
of O
the O
batteries B-AS
with O
the O
shipping B-AS
carton I-AS
. O

Love O
it O
so O
far O
. O

It O
is O
so O
much O
easier O
to O
use B-AS

There O
is O
no O
need O
to O
open O
a O
program B-AS
first O
and O
the O
cliick O
open O
or O
import O
. O

In O
short O
, O
you O
could O
say O
your O
mac O
could O
become O
your O
best O
friend O
no O
intention O
of O
replacing O
Rover O
your O
dog O
. O

It O
was O
a O
bad O
experience O
but O
i O
played O
down O
its O
importance O
. O

Meets O
my O
needs O
perfectly O
and O
is O
light O
enough O
for O
this O
senior O
to O
carry O
without O
affecting O
my O
arthritis O
. O

It O
is O
so O
nice O
not O
to O
worry O
about O
that O
and O
the O
extra O
expense O
that O
comes O
along O
with O
the O
necessary O
virus B-AS
protection I-AS
on O
PC O
's O
. O

The O
Notebook O
PC O
, O
Toshiba O
Qosmio O
is O
the O
best O
gift O
my O
father O
could O
have O
ever O
gotten O
me O
. O

Three O
weeks O
after O
I O
bought O
the O
netbook O
, O
the O
screen B-AS
quit O
working O
. O

The O
processor B-AS
screams O
, O
and O
because O
of O
the O
unique O
way O
that O
Apple O
OSX B-AS
16 I-AS
functions O
, O
most O
of O
the O
graphics B-AS
are O
routed O
through O
the O
hardware B-AS
rather O
than O
the O
software B-AS
. O

I O
am O
currently O
out O
of O
town O
and O
called O
to O
inform O
them O
the O
broken O
part O
would O
be O
returned O
when O
I O
got O
back O
in O
town O
. O

Returned O
laptop O
for O
a O
4th O
repair O
and O
it O
came O
back O
but O
now O
would O
lock O
up O
and O
randomly O
reboot O
frequently O
making O
the O
laptop O
unusable O
. O

I O
wanted O
something O
that O
had O
a O
new O
Intel B-AS
Core I-AS
processors I-AS
and O
HDMI B-AS
port I-AS
so O
that O
we O
could O
hook O
it O
up O
directly O
to O
our O
TV O
. O

The O
Apple O
will O
run O
Internet O
Explorer O
, O
but O
at O
an O
amazingly O
slow O
rate O
. O

With O
today O
's O
company O
fighting O
over O
marketshare O
, O
its O
a O
shame O
that O
ASUS O
can O
get O
away O
with O
the O
inept O
staff B-AS
answering O
thephone O
. O

Other O
than O
that O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
one O
complaint O
in O
the O
world O
! O

The O
computer O
is O
so O
slow O
, O
even O
after O
paying O
staples O
the O
extra O
money O
to O
speed O
it O
up O
. O

I O
feel O
that O
enough O
people O
have O
Macs O
these O
days O
and O
that O
companies O
need O
to O
start O
making O
things O
more O
compatable O
than O
they O
used O
to O
be O
. O

The O
price B-AS
premium I-AS
is O
a O
little O
much O
, O
but O
when O
you O
start O
looking O
at O
the O
features B-AS
it O
is O
worth O
the O
added O
cash O
. O

* O
5 O
weeks O
after O
giving O
the O
computer O
for O
repair*-Apple O
offers O
to O
send O
replacement O
after O
they O
receive O
the O
old O
computer O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
say O
enough O
of O
how O
satisfied O
I O
am O
with O
their O
product B-AS
and I-AS
help I-AS
aftermarket I-AS
. O

My O
computer O
was O
one O
of O
the O
best O
in O
the O
school O
compared O
to O
my O
fellow O
classmates O
. O

I O
bought O
for O
my O
son O
in O
the O
2nd O
grade O
. O

This O
has O
happened O
three O
times O
so O
far O
. O

I O
' O
m O
a O
professional O
consultant O
, O
and O
a O
client O
needed O
work O
on O
her O
machine O
. O

compresses O
itself O
and O
you O
ca O
n't O
use O
it O
. O

Microsoft B-AS
word I-AS
was O
not O

Who O
knows O
what O
will O
happen O
later O
on O
when O
they O
dismantle O
the O
whole O
damn O
thing O
? O
So O
, O
I O
said O
I O

If O
you O
already O
own O
a O
2009 O
, O
2010 O
, O
or O
early O
2011 O

you O
should O
wait O
until O
the O
next O
update O
. O

My O
Toshiba O
did O
not O
have O
sound B-AS
on O
everything O
, O
just O
certain O
things O
. O

I O
am O
overall O
very O
pleased O
with O

like O
the O

So O
, O
I O
must O
say O
I O
am O
not O
a O
happy O
camper O

-Called O

I O
bought O
it O
during O
the O
recent O
Comex O
IT O

The O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
was O
shorter O
than O
expected O

It O

I O
have O
never O

It O

? O
It O
will O
NOT O

I O
have O

My O

me O
crazy O
when O
I O
want O
to O
download O
a O

something O
of O
that O
nature O
and O
I O
ca O

its O
not O
compatable O
with O

With O
a O

shut B-AS
down I-AS

all O
the O

It O
was O
very O
easy O

It O

not O
take O
long O
to O

This O

had O
exactly O
the O

I O
needed O

Overall O
, O
still O
a O
very O
nice O
machine O

Where O
you O

you O

My O
kids O
and O
dogs O
destroyed O
two O
power B-AS
cords I-AS
by O
pulling O
on O
them O
. O

I O
had O
upgraded O
my O
old O
MacBook O
to O
Lion O
, O
so O
I O
kind O
of O
knew O
what O
I O
was O
getting O
, O
but O
had O
n't O
been O
able O
to O
enjoy O
some O
of O
the O
awesome O
new O
multi B-AS
- I-AS
touch I-AS

I O
had O
this O
computer O
for O
one O
month O
and O
had O
to O
send O
it O
in O
for O
repair O
. O

The O
screen B-AS
is O
a O
little O
glary O
, O
and O
I O
hated O
the O
clicking B-AS
buttons I-AS
, O
but O
I O
got O
used O
to O
them O
. O

Not O
to O
mention O
, O
the O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
is O
absolutely O
amazing O
. O

I O
realize O
that O
not O
every O

has O
this O
issue O

but O
the O
ones O
that O
do O
can O
not O
be O
repaired O

I O
have O
had O
a O
Mac O
for O
6 O
years O
and O
wo O
n't O
go O
back O
to O
PC O
. O

i O
love O
to O
use O
it O
it O
is O
esay O
and O
light O
. O

Windows B-AS
also O
shuts O
the O
computer O
down O
for O
no O
reason O
without O
warning O
. O

not O
using O
wired B-AS
lan I-AS
not O
sure O
what O
that O
s O
about O
. O

After O
about O
another O
month O
I O
had O
to O
send O
it O
in O
AGAIN O
to O
Acer O
for O
repairs O
. O

The O
macbook O
rarely O
requires O
a O
hard O
reboot O
. O

I O
LOVE O
it O
! O

The O
# O
1 O
reason O
that O
is O
always O
repeated O
. O

Now O
for O
the O
hardware B-AS
problems O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
that O
is O
not O
the O
case O
. O

Anyways O
I O
bought O
this O
two O
months O
ago O
and O
when O
I O
first O
brought O
it O
home O
it O
kept O
giving O
me O
a O
message O
about O
a O
vibration O
in O
the O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
and O
it O
is O
putting O
it O
temporaly O
in O
save O
zone O
. O

It O
's O
fast O
and O
has O
excellent O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
. O

It O
's O
face O
and O
depanable O
. O

No O
Viruses O
! O

I O
' O
m O
just O
really O
happy O
that O
I O
waited O
to O
buy O
, O
because O
this O
thing O
kicks O
a O
$ O
$ O
! O

The O
Hewitt O
Packard O
Pavillion O
dv6700 O
was O
my O
first O
laptop O
, O
before O
this O
I O
had O
a O
Dell O
desktop O
that O
I O
loved O
. O

Apple B-AS
care I-AS
included O
. O

It O
was O
an O
all O
around O
waste O
of O
money O
for O
me O
. O

I O
worked O
in O
IT O
retail O
sales O
before O
. O

Features B-AS
like O
the O
font B-AS
are O
very O
block O
- O
like O
and O
old O
school O
. O

It O
has O
everything O
you O
need O
to O
get O
the O
job O
done O
. O

It O
is O
loaded O
with O
programs B-AS
that O
is O
of O
no O
good O
for O
the O
average O
user O
, O
that O
makes O
it O
run B-AS
way O
to O
slow O
. O

I O
feel O
that O
it O
was O
poorly O
put O
together O
, O
because O
once O
in O
a O
while O
different O
plastic B-AS
pieces I-AS
would O
come O
off O
of O
it O
. O

it O
ca O
n't O
fuction O
well O
with O
lots O
of O
webpages O
open O
at O
once O
. O

Finally O
, O
I O
should O
note O
that O
I O
took O
the O
2 B-AS
GB I-AS
RAM I-AS
stick I-AS
from O
my O
old O
EeePC O
and O
installed O
it O
before O
I O
even O
powered O
on O
for O
the O
first O
time O
. O

This O
laptop O
has O
left O
me O
with O
a O
HORRIBLE O
taste O
in O
my O
mouth O
for O
Acer O
brand O
products O
. O

its O
not O
bad O
just O
VERY O
VERY O
annoying O
. O

Well O
, O
maybe O
more O
like O
week O
one O
. O

Windows B-AS
is O
also O
rather O
unsteady O
on O
its O
feet O
and O
is O
susceptible O
to O
many O
bugs O
. O

After O
sending O
out O
documents O
via O
email O
and O
having O
recipients O
tell O
me O
they O
could O
not O
open O
the O
documents O
or O
they O
came O
through O
as O
gibberish O
, O
I O
broke O
down O
and O
spent O
another O
$ O
100 O
to O
get O
Microsoft B-AS
Word I-AS
for I-AS
Mac I-AS
. O

I O
believe O
I O
purchased O
this O
in O
Dec O
09 O
for O
my O
primary O
work O
laptop O
which O
is O
used O
5 O
- O
10 O
hours O
a O
day O
, O
4 O
- O
6 O
days O
a O
week O
. O

DO O
NOT O
BUY O
GATEWAY O
COMPUTERS O
THEY O
ARE O
JUNK O
AND O
THE O
WARRANTY B-AS
COMPANY I-AS
IS O
HORRIBLE O
. O

then O
on O
top O
of O
it O
all O
their O
cusromer B-AS
service I-AS
center I-AS
is O
in O
the O
middle O
east O
. O

The O
only O
bad O
part O
is O
the O
size B-AS
. O

The O
little O
battery B-AS
that O
it O
did O
have O
would O
only O
last O
about O
an O
hour O
while O
just O
having O
it O
on O
the O
desktop O
. O

I O
liked O
the O
aluminum B-AS
body I-AS
. O

also O
it O
is O
light O
weight O
compared O
to O
others O
. O

Its O
good O
for O
playing B-AS
my O
apps O
on O
Facebook O
or O
watching B-AS
movies I-AS
. O

From O
the O
build B-AS
quality I-AS
to O
the O
performance B-AS
, O
everything O
about O
it O
has O
been O
sub O
- O
par O
from O
what O
I O
would O
have O
expected O
from O
Apple O
. O

I O
love O
the O
dock B-AS
where O
I O
can O
simply O
drop O
a O
file O
ontop O
of O
a O
particular O
program B-AS
, O
and O
the O
program B-AS
will O
simply O
open O
that O
file O
. O

Sorry O
, O
newegg O
. O

Be O
safe O
buy O
a O
Sony O
. O

pretty O
much O
everything O
else O
about O
the O
computer O
is O
good O
it O
just O
stops O
working B-AS
out O
of O
no O
were O
. O

Originally O
bought O
it O
for O
my O
wife O
. O

It O
was O
truly O
a O
great O
computer O
costing B-AS
less O
than O
one O
thousand O
bucks O
before O
tax O
. O

Waiting O
for O
the O
i7 B-AS
was O
well O
worth O
it O
, O
great O
value O
for O
the O
price B-AS
. O

I O
bought O
this O
laptop O
on O
Saturday O
and O
am O
completely O
in O
love O
with O
it O
! O

I O
asked O
how O
they O
would O
determine O
that O
since O
there O
are O
no O
scratches O
, O
dents O
or O
other O
signs O
of O
damage O
and O
was O
told O
that O
was O
the O
only O
way O
this O
type O
of O
damage O
could O
happen O
. O

Now O
, O
, O
, O
, O
, O
my O
monitor B-AS
has O
been O
acting O
up O
for O
about O
2 O
months O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
extended B-AS
warranty I-AS
was O
a O
problem O
. O

Boots B-AS
up I-AS
fast O
and O
runs B-AS
great O
! O

Lightweight O
and O
the O
screen B-AS
is O
beautiful O
! O

Buy O
it O
, O
love O
it O
, O
and O
I O
promise O
you O
wo O
n't O
regret O
it O
. O

I O
needed O
a O
driver B-AS
for O
my O
HP O
and O
they O
would O
not O
help O
me O
with O
out O
me O
paying O
over O
$ O
50 O
for O
it O
. O

If O
you O
do O
n't O
like O
fingerprints O
, O
this O
might O
not O
be O
the O
laptop O
for O
you O
. O

Call O
tech B-AS
support I-AS
, O
standard O
email O
the O
form O
and O
fax O
it O
back O
in O
to O
us O
. O

Just O
a O
month O
and O
a O
half O
or O
two O
months O
ago O
, O
my O
VAIO O
crashed O
again O
. O

They O
sent O
it O
back O
with O
a O
huge O
crack O
in O
it O
and O
it O
still O
did O
n't O
work B-AS
. O

A O
coupla O
months O
later O
, O
they O
change O
my O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
. O

I O
did O
contact O
HP O
and O
share O
how O
unhappy O
I O
am O
. O

The O
Macbook O
arrived O
in O
a O
nice O
twin B-AS
packing I-AS
and O
sealed O
in O
the O
box O
, O
all O
the O
functions B-AS
works O
great O
. O

The O
13 O
MacBook O
Pro O
is O
portable O
, O
durable O
, O
and O
very O
capable O
. O

I O
should O
have O
spent O
an O
extra O
hundred O
bucks O
and O
got O
a O
full O
sized O
computer O
. O

Great O
overall O
. O

My O
smart O
phone O
is O
faster O
! O

They O
say O
sorry O
out O
of O
warranty B-AS
. O

I O
have O
full O
control O
at O
all O
times O
of O
what O
is O
going O
on O
, O
there O
is O
no O
control+alt+delete O
business O
anymore O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
laptop O
because O
of O
the O
performance B-AS
to O
price B-AS
ratio O
. O

PC O
never O
worked O
right O
even O
after O
BIOS B-AS
fixed O
. O

After O
having O
two O
PC O
laptops O
die O
with O
in O
the O
past O
3 O
years O
, O
I O
was O
led O
to O
the O
Apple O
display O
at O
Best O
Buy O
by O
the O
sleek O
design B-AS
and O
promise O
of O
less O
tech B-AS
issues I-AS
. O

I O
have O
a O
laptop O
as O
my O
regular O
computer O
, O
but O
found O
that O
disconnecting O
it O
and O
lugging O
it O
around O
was O
a O
drag O
. O

This O
is O
my O
second O
MacBook O
. O

The O
size B-AS
is O
perfect O
and O
I O
do O
not O
recomend O
anything O
bigger O
except O
for O
any O
person O
who O
can O
exceed O
the O
limited O
space B-AS
it O
gives O
you O
. O

The O
service B-AS
I O
received O
from O
Toshiba O
went O
above O
and O
beyond O
the O
call O
of O
duty O
. O

Have O
had O
many O
higher O
priced B-AS
computers O
crash O
and O
burn O
long O
before O
ever O
got O
to O
use O
all O
that O
great O
memory B-AS
and O
speed B-AS
, O
etc O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
it O
just O
because O
of O
the O
internet B-AS
speed I-AS
probably O
because O
that O
s O
the O
only O
thing O
i O
really O
care O
about O
. O

I O
own O
other O
Macs O
but O
always O
find O
myself O
navigation O
to O
the O
MacBook O
Pro O
to O
get O
my O
work O
done O
. O

There O
are O
several O
programs B-AS
for O
Garageband B-AS
Pages I-AS
, O
Garageband B-AS
, O
Garageband B-AS
, O
etc O
, O
music B-AS
Garageband I-AS
, O
photo B-AS
management I-AS
Photo I-AS
Booth I-AS
, O
iPhoto B-AS
, O
video B-AS
- I-AS
editing I-AS
or O
movie B-AS
- I-AS
making I-AS
iMovie I-AS
, O
etc O
. O

This O
is O
my O
3rd O
Apple O
Laptop O
and O
first O
MacBook O
Pro O
. O

I O
have O
had O
this O
laptop O
for O
a O
few O
months O
now O
and O
i O
would O
say O
i O
m O
pretty O
satisfied O
. O

The O
love O
part O
of O
my O
relationship O
with O
this O
laptop O
does O
n't O
take O
very O
long O
. O

Not O
enough O
time O
for O
me O
to O
give O
it O
5 O
stars O
! O

The O
screen B-AS
shows O
great O
colors B-AS
. O

Reason O
why O
? O
It O
's O
because O
when O
you O
buy O
it O
, O
you O
know O
first O
thing O
that O
you O
will O
not O
lose O
any O
value B-AS
for O
that O
laptop O
, O
the O
price B-AS
will O
stay O
the O
same O
for O
the O
next O
year O
, O
and O
even O
if O
Apple O
does O
decides O
to O
change O
mode O
, O
your O
laptop O
value B-AS
will O
only O
drop O
10 O
- O
20 O
% O
, O
unlike O
PC O
laptops O
which O
drop O
more O
than O
80 O
% O
. O

That O
's O
a O
huge O
difference O
. O

Dells O
are O
ok O
, O
HPs O
are O
n't O
that O
good O
, O
but O
Macs O
or O
Fantastic O
. O

So O
, O
buyers O
beware O
! O

I O
am O
totally O
satisfied O
with O
my O
little O
toshie O
! O

I O
have O
no O
idea O
how O
to O
burn B-AS
cd I-AS
's I-AS
or O
to O
use O
the O
web B-AS
cam I-AS
, O
just O
for O
starters O
. O

Again O
, O
I O
sent O
it O
off O
to O
Acer O
, O
by O
this O
time O
they O
were O
paying O
for O
me O
to O
send O
it O
to O
them O
and O
everything O
, O
but O
it O
was O
still O
inconvienent O
because O
of O
my O
classes O
and O
my O
communication O
with O
my O
fiance O
. O

DEFINITELY O
recommended O
! O
! O
! O

It O
is O
extremely O
user O
friendly O
and O
intuitive O
. O

Let O
me O
start O
with O
the O
good O
, O
So O
awesome O
. O

I O
had O
finally O
reached O
my O
limit O
and O
broke O
down O
. O

The O
17 B-AS
inch I-AS
screen I-AS
is O
very O
large O
, O
but O
the O
computer O
is O
very O
light O
. O

My O
opinion O
of O
Sony O
has O
been O
dropping O
as O
fast O
as O
the O
stock O
market O
, O
given O
their O
horrible O
support B-AS
, O
but O
this O
machine O
just O
caused O
another O
plunge O
. O

Do O
I O
like O
the O
computer O
? O
Well O
, O
other O
than O
not O
getting O
viruses O
, O
I O
guess O
it O
is O
OK O
. O

For O
the O
Bluetooth B-AS
to O
work O
properly O
, O
you O
must O
install O
the O
Launch B-AS
Manager I-AS
on O
the O
Drivers B-AS
/ I-AS
Applications I-AS
DVD I-AS
, O
or O
it O
will O
not O
show O
after O
the O
reload O
. O

I O
waited O
and O
waited O
and O
no O
laptop O
. O

Everything O
is O
falling O
apart O
internally O
and O
externally O
. O

I O
also O
liked O
the O
glass B-AS
screen I-AS
. O

The O
switchable B-AS
graphic I-AS
card I-AS
is O
pretty O
sweet O
when O
you O
want O
gaming B-AS
on O
the O
laptop O
. O

It O
super O
shiny O
, O
so O
you O
can O
see O
the O
fingerprints O
easily O
. O

It O
's O
not O
a O
wear O
- O
and O
- O
tear O
issue O
, O
not O
due O
to O
user O
carelessness O
and O
most O
importantly O
, O
they O
CA O
N'T O
guarantee O
the O
problem O
will O
be O
solved O
if O
it O
is O
sent O
for O
service B-AS
and O
I O
have O
to O
accept O
the O
outcome O
. O

The O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
has O
not O
decreased O
since O
I O
bought O
it O
, O
so O
i O
' O
m O
thrilled O
with O
that O
. O

Its O
a O
dog O
plain O
and O
simple O
. O

When O
I O
called O
Toshiba O
, O
they O
would O
not O
do O
anything O
and O
even O
tried O
to O
charge O
me O
$ O
35 O
for O
the O
phone O
call O
, O
even O
though O
they O
did O
n't O
offer O
any O
technical B-AS
support I-AS
. O

My O
HP O
is O
very O
heavy O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
notebook O
and O
only O
had O
it O
for O
3 O
months O
If O
it O
is O
overload O
with O
updates O
the O
BOOT B-AS
MGR I-AS
. O

Oh O
and O
if O
that O
s O
not O
bad O
enough O
it O
does O
n't O
come O
with O
a O
recovery B-AS
cd I-AS
so O
you O
can O
make O
one O
if O
you O
know O
how O
to O
or O
buy O
one O
if O
you O
buy O
it O
the O
cost O
is O
$ O
25 O
for O
two O
cds O
. O

The O
price B-AS
and O
features B-AS
more O
than O
met O
my O
needs O
. O

They O
refuse O
. O

big O
mistake O
! O

Best O
Buy O
was O
great O
as O
always O
and O
accepted O
the O
return O
and O
gave O
me O
another O
model O
1764 O
. O

and O
dell O
and O
best O
buy O
both O
refused O
to O
take O
it O
back O
after O
i O
only O
had O
it O
for O
1 O
hour O
. O

My O
friends O
or O
children O
use O
that O
when O
they O
need O
to O
borrow O
the O
Net O
When O
I O
out O
grow O
this O
Meaning O
when O
its O
old O
and O
my O
oldest O
child O
is O
ready O
for O
one O
she O
will O
get O
this O
one O
ANd O
I O
will O
be O
buying O
only O
TOSHIBA O
! O

First O
of O
all O
, O
I O
' O
ve O
been O
Dell O
fan O
for O
more O
than O
fifteen O
years O
. O

GREAT O
INVESTMENT O
! O

I O
am O
just O
amazed O
. O

I O
burned O
my O
leg O
, O
after O
lifting O
it O
from O
my O
desk O
, O
and O
for O
less O
than O
5 O
second O
putting O
it O
on O
my O
lap O
to O
clean O
my O
coffee O
table O
, O
so O
I O
can O
place O
it O
there O
. O

I O
thought O
all O
my O
problems O
would O
finally O
be O
solved O
being O
that O
my O
old O
computer O
would O
n't O
go O
onto O
our O
wireless O
network O
and O
I O
would O
n't O
have O
the O
same O
problems O
because O
it O
was O
updated O
. O

Skype B-AS
is O
just O
so O
dang O
cool O
with O
this O
machine O
too O
. O

I O
would O
buy O
this O
lap O
top O
over O
and O
over O
again O
! O

the O
mouse B-AS
buttons I-AS
are O
hard O
to O
push O
. O

I O
can O
actually O
get O
work O
done O
with O
this O
MAC O
, O
and O
not O
fight O
with O
it O
like O
my O
tired O
old O
PC O
laptop O
. O

Also O
, O
HDD B-AS
secures O
inside O
using O
rails B-AS
, O
and O
there O
is O
only O
one O
set O
on O
the O
main O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
. O

If O
you O
're O
not O
wanting O
to O
be O
mobile O
, O
this O
is O
a O
good O
laptop O
to O
sit O
on O
a O
desk O
. O

I O
also O
travel O
with O
it O
and O
it O
never O
gives O
me O
any O
problems O
. O

Just O
do O
n't O
waste O
your O
time O
and O
money O
on O
this O
. O

All O
I O
will O
say O
now O
is O
that O
it O
was O
over O
two O
grand O
less O
expensive O
and O
so O
much O
better O
quality B-AS
than O
my O
hunk O
of O
crap O
Vaio O
. O

Beware O
, O
their O
staff B-AS
could O
send O
you O
back O
making O
you O
feel O
that O
only O
they O
know O
what O
a O
computer O
is O
. O

And O
I O
' O
m O
still O
paying O
the O
bloody O
financing O
, O
for O
a O
product O
which O
did O
n't O
last O
me O
at O
least O
three O
years O
! O

Games B-AS
being O
the O
main O
issue O
. O

No O
problems O
, O
no O
lock O
ups O
, O
no O
disappointments O
. O

While O
the O
computer O
seems O
to O
be O
set O
up O
in O
a O
common O
sense O
way O
rather O
than O
in O
geek O
- O
speak O
, O
there O
are O
certain O
quirks O
that O
can O
drive O
you O
crazy O
trying O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
PC O
world O
. O

I O
am O
definitely O
sold O
, O
and O
not O
going O
back O
to O
PCs O
for O
home O
use O
! O

I O
have O
a O
lapdesk O
which O
I O
can O
use O
, O
but O
I O
can O
still O
feel O
the O
heat O
through O
the O
foam O
and O
plastic O
. O

and O
its O
really O
cheap O
and O
you O
wo O
nt O
regret O
buying O
it O
. O

It O
was O
over O
rated O
! O

I O
do O
n't O
understand O
how O
anyone O
can O
think O
this O
is O
a O
great O
product O
worth O
purchasing O
. O

My O
sister O
has O
the O
same O
Mac O
as O
me O
and O
she O
is O
in O
a O
band O
and O
uses O
GarageBand B-AS
to O
record O
and O
edit O
. O

I O
was O
n't O
really O
sure O
I O
wanted O
to O
spend O
that O
kind O
of O
money O
! O

Other O
Thoughts O
, O
Do O
not O
purchase O
this O
product O
. O

They O
say O
that O
this O
will O
invalidate O
the O
warranty B-AS
on O
the O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
I O
do O
n't O
really O
understand O
why O
but O
anyway O
. O

and O
looks O
very O
sexyy O
, O
D O
really O
the O
mac O
book O
pro O
is O
the O
best O
laptop O
specially O
for O
students O
in O
college O
if O
you O
are O
not O
caring O
about O
price B-AS
. O

I O
took O
the O
computer O
back O
in O
yet O
again O
except O
this O
time O
they O
kept O
it O
to O
send O
into O
their O
Geek O
Squad O
headquarters O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
laptop O
and O
I O
would O
recommend O
it O
to O
anyone O
. O

Thank O
God O
for O
ctrl O
ZBottom O
line O
, O
I O
' O
ve O
been O
using O
laptops O
since O
the O
mid O
90s O
and O
probably O
the O
majority O
of O
brands O
out O
there O
. O

They O
definitely O
have O
a O
superior O
product O
! O

A O
great O
computer O
for O
light O
home B-AS
use I-AS
and O
business B-AS
use I-AS
. O

Bought O
it O
to O
use O
mostly O
for O
oline O
classes O
. O

Even O
with O
virus B-AS
protection I-AS
, O
it O
always O
turned O
off O
when O
updates B-AS
were O
needed O
and O
installed O
. O

Also O
consider O
the O
MS B-AS
Office I-AS
apps I-AS
are O
all O
trial O
versions O
, O
hope O
you O
have O
your O
own O
copies O
. O

They O
are O
wonderful O
, O
but O
very O
dangerous O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
emitting O
heat O
. O

This O
computer O
was O
awful O
! O

Heck O
, O
if O
I O
had O
enough O
money O
, O
I O
would O
but O
it O
as O
a O
gift O
for O
someone O
. O

Even O
so O
, O
I O
like O
playing O
online O
games B-AS
, O
so O
it O
was O
wonderful O
that O
there O
is O
a O
feature B-AS
where O
I O
can O
dualboot O
Windows B-AS
. O

The O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
is O
amazingly O
long O
at O
7hrs O
and O
5hrs O
if O
you O
use O
it O
. O

My O
previous O
purchases O
were O
with O
Dell O
and O
HP O
. O

I O
have O
not O
have O
any O
problems O
. O

I O
purchased O
an O
HP O
right O
after O
my O
high O
school O
graduation O
. O

Me O
and O
my O
boyfriend O
bought O
the O
Gateway O
NV78 O
in O
nov O
of O
09 O
. O

It O
is O
very O
user O
friendly O
and O
not O
hard O
to O
figure O
out O
at O
all O
. O

lightweight O
, O
long O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
, O
excellent O
transition O
from O
PC O
; O

The O
price B-AS
is O
another O
driving O
influence O
that O
made O
me O
purchase O
this O
laptop O
. O

The O
Nortons B-AS
virus I-AS
scan I-AS
is O
only O
for O
a O
very O
short O
time O
unlike O
others O
that O
usually O
are O
good O
for O
a O
year O
. O

It O
is O
stamped O
and O
not O
in O
pieces O
therefore O
it O
is O
a O
stronger O
more O
resilient O
frame B-AS
. O

I O
am O
first O
time O
Mac O
Buyer O
and O
am O
amazed O
at O
features B-AS
and O
ease O
of O
use B-AS
the O
Mac O
offers O
. O

Two O
, O
owning O
a O
17 O
inmac O
book O
gives O
the O
flexibility O
to O
sit O
anywhere O
you O
want O
without O
worry O
about O
bother O
anyone O
. O

Sent O
unit O
back O
and O
it O
's O
been O
two O
months O
. O

Came O
fully O
loaded B-AS
, O
good O
. O

I O
noticed O
windows B-AS
has O
a O
new O
system O
called O
Windows B-AS
7 I-AS
, O
what O
about O
us O
Vista B-AS
users O
? O
They O
should O
get O
all O
the O
bugs O
out O
of O
Vista B-AS
before O
investing O
in O
a O
new O
system O
. O

When O
we O
bought O
our O
new O
HP O
comouter O
in O
Dec O
of O
2008 O
, O
we O
wanted O
Windows O
XP O
, O
but O
were O
told O
it O
would O
cost O
an O
extra O
$ O
159 O
, O
so O
we O
went O
with O
Vista B-AS
. O

I O
definatly O
ca O
n't O
. O

Files O
as O
well O
would O
become O
lost O
, O
deleted O
or O
corrupted O
. O

It O
is O
meant O
to O
be O
PORTABLE O
. O

My O
laptop O
worked O
again O
for O
just O
a O
while O
before O
I O
started O
having O
issues O
AGAIN O
. O

This O
is O
perfect O
for O
her O
field O
. O

taking O
it O
back O
less O
than O
24 O
hours O
of O
purchase O

That O
's O
the O
downside O
for O
me O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
I O
have O
, O
is O
the O
key B-AS
broad I-AS
is O
a O
little O
dark O
to O
see O
the O
letters O
, O
would O
help O
if O
it O
was O
a O
little O
lighter O
then O
it O
is O
. O

Hopefully O
Amazon O
will O
take O
this O
back O
. O

They O
ended O
up O
keeping O
my O
computer O
for O
almost O
3 O
months O
! O

I O
' O
m O
still O
within O
the O
one O
year O
warranty B-AS
but O
the O
repair B-AS
" I-AS
depot I-AS
" I-AS
has O
deemed O
that O
this O
time O
it O
was O
caused O
by O
physical O
abuse O
and O
is O
not O
covered O
. O

But O
I O
needed O
a O
laptop O
for O
school B-AS
use I-AS
. O

he O
ca O
n't O
stand O
it O
. O

The O
computer O
was O
delivered O
as O
promised O
. O

This O
is O
the O
complete O
opposite O
to O
an O
ergonomic O
design B-AS
. O

I O
would O
like O
at O
least O
a O
4 O
hr O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
. O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
I O
do O
n't O
like O
about O
my O
mac O
is O
that O
sometimes O
there O
are O
programs B-AS
that O
I O
want O
to O
be O
able O
to O
run O
and O
I O
am O
not O
able O
to O
. O

Looking O
online O
, O
many O
people O
are O
having O
the O
same O
problem O
. O

Wireless B-AS
has O
not O
been O
a O
issue O
for O
me O
, O
like O
some O
others O
have O
meantioned O
. O

THIS O
IS O
MY O
SECOND O
MAC O
BOOK O
PRO O
. O

MacBook O
Notebooks O
quickly O
die O
out O
because O
of O
their O
short O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
many O
background O
programs B-AS
that O
run O
without O
the O
user O
's O
knowlede O
. O

All O
the O
things O
you O
can O
do O
with O
the O
trackpad B-AS
make O
navigating B-AS
around O
the O
computer O
and O
its O
programs B-AS
so O
much O
simpler O
, O
quicker O
, O
and O
easier O
. O

I O
guess O
the O
only O
good O
thing O
that O
came O
out O
of O
these O
were O
the O
speakers B-AS
and O
the O
subwoofer B-AS
. O

There O
s O
a O
built B-AS
in I-AS
camera I-AS
with O
special O
effects O
for O
video O
and O
photography O
. O

All O
for O
such O
a O
great O
price B-AS
. O

I O
went O
right O
out O
and O
purchased O
another O
laptop O
. O

Long O
story O
short O
, O
since O
I O
experience O
so O
many O
problems O
with O
my O
laptop O
every O
since O
I O
bought O
it O
from O
day O
one O
, O
I O
did O
n't O
ask O
for O
a O
new O
laptop O
or O
a O
refund O
of O
what O
I O
pay O
for O
a O
crapy O
laptop O
, O
but O
just O
an O
extension O
of O
my O
laptop O
warranty B-AS
for O
another O
year O
, O
they O
made O
a O
big O
deal O
of O
out O
that O
and O
after O
so O
many O
calls O
and O
complaints O
about O
their O
products O
and O
services O
, O
they O
finally O
gave O
in O
. O

I O
am O
able O
to O
play O
720p O
and O
1080p O
media O
files O
just O
fine O
with O
it O
. O

I O
already O
own O
an O
iPhone O
, O
and O
so O
the O
move O
just O
made O
more O
sense O
. O

So O
think O
about O
factoring O
those O
things O
in O
when O
you O
purchase O
. O

Took O
the O
netbook O
on O
a O
vacation O
trip O
and O
I O
was O
able O
to O
do O
whatever O
I O
wanted O
to O
do O
without O
lugging O
a O
much O
heavier O
laptop O
. O

Everything O
was O
up O
and O
running O
within O
15 O
minutes O
of O
unboxing O
. O

This O
computer O
gets O
very O
hot O
, O
before O
shutting O
down O
. O

Another O
thing O
is O
that O
after O
only O
a O
month O
the O
left B-AS
mouse I-AS
key I-AS
broke O
and O
it O
costed B-AS
$ O
175 O
to O
send O
it O
in O
to O
fix O
it O
. O

Went O
silently O
. O

Satisfy O
what O
I O
paid O
for O
it O
. O

IT O
IS O
TRASH O
! O

It O
has O
good O
speed B-AS
and O
plenty O
of O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
space I-AS
. O

Clear O
picture B-AS
on O
it O
and O
everything O
. O

Overall O
though O
, O
for O
the O
money O
spent O
it O
's O
a O
great O
deal O
. O

So O
you O
do O
n't O
get O
frustrated O
the O
first O
few O
weeks O
. O

They O
said O
that O
my O
computer O
was O
covered O
on O
an O
extended B-AS
warranty I-AS
, O
and O
that O
products O
with O
extended B-AS
warranties I-AS
are O
taken O
care O
of O
through O
third O
parties O
and O
not O
Sony O
itself O
anymore O
. O

It O
's O
so O
useable O
and O
responsive O
. O

It O
is O
truly O
a O
Desktop O
Replacement O
. O

I O
only O
used O
it O
to O
browse O
the O
internet O
and O
and O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
many O
times O
it O
has O
spontaniously O
shut O
down O
and O
it O
is O
just O
a O
blank O
screen O
now O
. O

A O
little O
pricey O
but O
it O
is O
well O
, O
well O
worth O
it O
. O

Very O
long O
- O
life O
battery B-AS
up O
to O
10 O
- O
11 O
hours O
depending O
on O
how O
you O
configure O
power O
level O
settings O
. O

Screen B-AS
is O
awesome O
, O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
is O
good O
. O

The O
black O
model O
also O
has O
a O
very O
nice O
seamless O
appearance B-AS
, O
one O
of O
the O
better O
looking O
notebooks O
I O
' O
ve O
seen O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
it O
was O
not O
as O
user O
friendly O
as O
I O
expected O
either O
. O

The O
technical B-AS
service I-AS
for I-AS
dell I-AS
is O
so O
3rd O
world O
it O
might O
as O
well O
not O
even O
bother O
. O

The O
graphics B-AS
were O
awful O
and O
the O
warranty B-AS
is O
n't O
even O
worth O
the O
cheap O
payment O
on O
the O
computer O
. O

and O
if O
u O
did O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
had O
the O
MacBook O
Pro O
15 O
for O
about O
three O
weeks O
, O
and O
it O
really O
is O
a O
great O
computer O
. O

They O
gave O
me O
a O
hard O
time O
yet O
again O
, O
but O
their O
was O
a O
malfunction O
in O
the O
battery B-AS
itself O
, O
it O
did O
n't O
die O
. O

It O
was O
definelty O
a O
smart O
move O
. O

I O
' O
m O
excited O
to O
learn O
more O
about O
what O
this O
powerful O
machine O
has O
to O
offer O
and O
encourage O
others O
to O
do O
the O
same O
. O

Apparently O
they O
are O
defective O
since O
they O
are O
not O
securely O
attached O
. O

but O
other O
then O
that O
I O
would O
give O
this O
product O
a O
4 O
in O
hafe O
stars O
. O

Sure O
hope O
Best O
Buy O
will O
replace O
it O
asap O
. O

I O
babyed O
the O
heck O
out O
of O
it O
and O
i O
still O
do O
. O

Handles O
all O
my O
basic O
media O
needs O
easily O
. O

Just O
what O
the O
doctor O
ordered O
. O

If O
you O
do O
n't O
feel O
comfortable O
doing O
it O
yourself O
, O
just O
buy O
the O
case B-AS
and O
be O
happy O
, O
plus O
it O
looks O
nice O
, O
I O
bought O
the O
white O
one O
from O
Best O
Buy O
. O

The O
reaction O
of O
Toshiba O
is O
there O
is O
nothing O
you O
can O
do O
about O
it O
so O
just O
sit O
back O
and O
except O
the O
fact O
that O
you O
are O
powerless O
and O
it O
is O
mind O
over O
matter O
. O

you O
can O
find O
many O
laptops O
with O
the O
same O
performance B-AS
and O
even O
better O
with O
lower O
price B-AS
, O
but O
you O
can O
not O
find O
the O
look B-AS
, O
easy O
, O
applications B-AS
, O
and O
the O
experience O
in O
mac O
. O

Excellent O
speed B-AS
for O
processing O
data O
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
I O
' O
m O
incredibly O
dissatisfied O
with O
this O
laptop O
, O
and O
with O
HP O
as O
a O
whole O
. O

I O
am O
not O
happy O
at O
all O
with O
the O
product O
I O
purchased O
. O

When O
you O
call O
tech B-AS
support I-AS
you O
were O
routed O
to O
someone O
who O
was O
in O
another O
country O
and O
did O
not O
know O
what O
they O
were O
doing O
. O

It O
has O
come O
into O
good O
use B-AS
for O
my O
finances O
, O
scheduling O
, O
my O
parents O
business O
expenses O
, O
and O
it O
is O
definitely O
amazing O
for O
gaming B-AS
. O

I O
was O
taught O
to O
use O
Photoshop B-AS
and O
was O
amazed O
. O

It O
's O
A O
MAC O
! O
! O

It O
was O
weird O
. O

I O
can O
hardly O
wait O
to O
see O
what O
s O
around O
the O
next O
corner O
. O

the O
apple O
pro O
notebook O
will O
not O
let O
you O
down O
. O

I O
did O
a O
review O
on O
it O
, O
its O
awesome O
. O

Before O
we O
got O
this O
laptop O
, O
had O
a O
compaq O
pasaro O
for O
5 O
years O
with O
no O
problems O
. O

I O
tried O
out O
another O
Mac O
for O
a O
few O
months O
before O
buying O
this O
one O
and O
it O
is O
a O
great O
machine O
. O

Somehow O
the O
system B-AS
clock I-AS
got O
messed O
up O
after O
reboot O
. O

the O
only O
problem O
is O
that O
i O
had O
to O
add O
1 O
gb O
RAM B-AS
, O
the O
computer O
was O
kinda O
slow O
. O

With O
the O
macbook O
pro O
it O
comes O
with O
freeASPECT0 O
to O
protect O
it O
from O
viruses O
and O
other O
intrusive O
things O
from O
downloads O
and O
internet O
surfing O
or O
emails O
. O

The O
computer O
could O
have O
been O
shipped O
by O
Priority O
Mail O
through O
the O
USPS O
for O
the O
same O
cost O
and O
arrived O
by O
Noon O
on O
Tue O
. O

I O
visited O
the O
Apple O
Store O
and O
was O
impressed O
with O
the O
17-inch O
MacBook O
Pro O
. O

The O
driver B-AS
updates I-AS
do O
n't O
fix O
the O
issue O
, O
very O
frustrating O
. O

I O
will O
never O
go O
back O
to O
Windows B-AS
! O

Do O
your O
research O
on O
this O
issue O
. O

Looking O
to O
take O
my O
video O
and O
photo O
editing O
to O
the O
next O
level O
, O
I O
decided O
to O
purchase O
the O
MBP O

in O
Intel O
Core O
i5 O
after O
reading O
consumer O
reviews O
as O
well O
as O
professional O
reviews O
of O
this O
laptop O
. O

It O
does O
nt O

When O
I O
first O

The O

apple O

one O
of O
the O
best O

companies O
in O

. O

PLEASE O
MAKE O
THESE O
! O

Frustrated O
I O
hung O
up O
and O
tried O
to O
call O
back O
3 O
days O
later O
to O
be O
told O
that O
it O
takes O
2 O
- O
3 O
days O
for O
turnaround O
time O
. O

After O
the O
first O
few O
months O
, O
the O
computer O
started O
crashing O
about O
every O
week O
. O

My O
son O
and O
his O
family O
have O
a O
hard O
time O
financially O
because O
he O
is O
self O
- O
employed O
so O
the O
family O
had O
no O
computer O
of O
any O
kind O
, O
and O
kyle O
the O
oldest O
child O
is O
12 O
and O
really O
need O
something O
to O
help O
him O
in O
school O
. O

It O
's O
a O
great O
product O
for O
a O
great O
price B-AS
! O

Again O
, O
the O
same O
problem O
, O
the O
right B-AS
speaker I-AS
did O
not O
work O
. O

But O
see O
the O
macbook O
pro O
is O
different O
because O
it O
may O
have O
a O
huge O
price O
tag O
but O
it O
comes O
with O
the O
full O
software B-AS
that O
you O
would O
actually O
need O
and O
most O
of O
it O
has O
free O
future O
updates B-AS
. O

Before O
i O
bought O
my O
new O
i5 O
, O
I O
did O
my O
research O
for O
about O
2 O
weeks O
and O
determined O
to O
move O
for O
HP O
to O
Apple O
for O
reliability O
, O
dependable O
, O
and O
long O
lasting O
operations O
. O

Dell O
wanted O
to O
charge O
us O
for O
everything O
everytime O
I O
called O
them O
with O
a O
problem O
. O

THIS O
HAS O
BEEN O
NOTHING O
BUT O
A O
HEADACHE O
SINCE O
WE O
PURCHASED O
IT O
. O

i O
have O
had O
my O
dell O
latitude O
for O
almost O
three O
years O
. O

May O
be O
better O
for O
the O
occasional O
web O
surfer O
. O

and O
the O
multiple B-AS
page I-AS
viewer I-AS
allows O
you O
to O
press O
one O
button O
to O
see O
every O
separate O
page O
currently O
opened O
at O
the O
same O
time O
in O
one O
screen O
are O
great O
for O
those O
who O
are O
working O
non O
stop O
or O
just O
shopping O
online O
. O

This O
was O
the O
3rd O
day O
and O
part O
still O
had O
not O
been O
shipped B-AS
. O

Obviously O
we O
both O
got O
new O
Macs O
. O

My O
Iphone O
synced O
right O
up O
just O
like O
a O
person O
would O
expect O
, O
unlike O
the O
PCs O
in O
our O
lives O
. O

That O
being O
said O
after O
2 O
weeks O
of O
owning O
every O
time O
I O
start O
it O
up O
now O
it O
gives O
me O
a O
black O
screen O
for O
5 O
- O
8 O
seconds O
stating O
pxe O
- O
e61 O
media O
test O
error O
check O
cable O
. O

It O
's O
fun O
to O
take O
to O
a O
bookstore O
, O
sit O
in O
the O
coffee O
shop O
area O
, O
sign O
in O
to O
WiFi O
and O
look O
up O
book O
reviews O
of O
books O
I O
might O
buy O
. O

Not O
super O
fancy O
, O
but O
not O
super O
expensive O
either O
. O

Keyboard B-AS
good O
sized O
and O
wasy O
to O
use B-AS
. O

HP O
said O
it O
was O
out O
of O
warranty B-AS
. O

-Stay O
away O
from O
Apple O
, O
or O
hope O
you O
laptop O
does O
not O
break O
down O
. O

It O
's O
a O
great O
prodcut O
to O
handle O
basic O
computing O
needs O
. O

I O
never O
had O
this O
kind O
of O
quality B-AS
issue O
with O
Dell O
not O
to O
say O
Dell O
is O
that O
great O
, O
not O
with O
a O
brand O
new O
laptop O
. O

wonderful O
features B-AS
. O

the O
laptop O
was O
really O
good O
and O
it O
goes O
really O
fast O
just O
the O
way O
i O
thought O
it O
would O
of O
run O
. O

I O
had O
to O
call O
HP O
and O
ask O
for O
a O
recovery B-AS
disk I-AS
because O
the O
computer O
does O
not O
come O
with O
one O
and O
completely O
redo O
it O
all O
. O

I O
m O
glad O
that O
it O
has O
such O
great O
features B-AS
in O
it O
. O

it O
's O
just O
a O
great O
toy O
to O
have O
around O
. O

I O
like O
those O
programs B-AS
better O
than O
Office B-AS
and O
you O
can O
save O
your O
files O
to O
be O
completely O
compatible O
with O
the O
Office B-AS
programs I-AS
as O
well O
. O

Great O
wifi B-AS
too O
. O

WHEN O
TYPING B-AS
, O
LETTERS O
AND O
SPACES O
ARE O
FREQUENTLY O
OMITTED O
REQUIRING O
THE O
USER O
TO O
REDO O
MANY O
WORDS O
AND O
SENTENCES O
. O

Only O
a O
few O
days O
after O
I O
received O
the O
computer O
back O
, O
the O
screen B-AS
froze O
again O
. O

It O
is O
not O
ideal O
for O
children O
because O
of O
the O
temp B-AS
. O

sounds O
like O
a O
typewriter O
, O
but O
if O
you O
can O
get O
past O
that O
, O
this O
is O
a O
great O
laptop O
for O
a O
little O
money O
! O

When O
this O
happened O
I O
would O
have O
to O
completely O
power O
off O
my O
computer O
and O
restart O
it O
. O

Although O
i O
do O
believe O
that O
Windows B-AS
operating I-AS
system I-AS
may O
be O
to O
fault O
for O
some O
of O
the O
problems O
. O

Great O
OS B-AS
, O
fabulous O
improvements O
to O
the O
existing O
line O
bumping O
up O
the O
processor B-AS
speed I-AS
and O
adding O
the O
thunderbolt B-AS
port I-AS
. O

I O
or O
my O
dad O
paid O
over O
twenty O
four O
hundred O
dollars O
for O
everything O
. O

The O
lcd B-AS
screen I-AS
stopped O
working O
on O
mine O
after O
10 O
months O
. O

That O
includes O
transferring O
my O
music O
and O
movies O
. O

Images B-AS
are O
crisp O
and O
clean O
. O

Took O
that O
one O
home O
, O
same O
thing O
. O

I O
' O
m O
going O
back O
to O
PC O
. O

Great O
, O
quick O
laptop O
for O
the O
money O
. O

although O
its O
windows B-AS
vista I-AS
compared O
to O
windows B-AS
xp I-AS
sucks O
. O

We O
have O
had O
numerous O
problems O
with O
Vista B-AS
, O
such O
as O
Adobe B-AS
Flash I-AS
player I-AS
just O
quits O
and O
has O
to O
be O
uninstalled O
and O
then O
reinsalled O
, O
Internet B-AS
Explore I-AS
just O
quits O
and O
you O
lose O
whatever O
you O
were O
working O
on O
, O
also O
, O
the O
same O
Windows B-AS
update I-AS
has O
appeared O
on O
this O
computer O
since O
we O
got O
it O
and O
has O
been O
update B-AS
probably O
400 O
times O
, O
the O
same O
update B-AS
. O

The O
Dell O
mini O
was O
the O
first O
Dell O
product O
that O
I O
had O
ever O
purchased O
. O

with O
the O
switch B-AS
being O
at O
the O
top O
you O
need O
to O
memorize O
the O
key O
combination O
rather O
than O
just O
flicking O
a O
switch B-AS
. O

My O
Mac O
has O
gone O
from O
being O
a O
trusted O
friend O
to O
an O
adversary O
. O

One O
more O
tip O
, O
please O
purchase O
this O
model O
and O
get O
a O
4 B-AS
GB I-AS
stick I-AS
of I-AS

By O
week O
two O
, O
my O
laptop O
had O
overheated O
and O
was O
completely O
dead O
even O
though O
I O
did O
not O
use O
it O
too O
much O
. O

And O
it O
is O
impossible O
to O
get O
them O
back O
in O
. O

My O
last O
laptop O
gave O
me O
a O
constant O
battle O
even O
though O
it O
was O
also O
completely O
new O
. O

I O
have O
been O
a O
mac O
user O
since O
the O
mid O
90s O
. O

It O
has O
bein O
into O
the O
shop O
to O
get O
a O
new O
hardrive B-AS
2 O
times O
and O
to O
fix O
the O
touch B-AS
control I-AS
buttons I-AS
on O
the O
keyboard B-AS
! O

After O
the O
bad O
experience O
with O
this O
computer O
went O
back O
to O
compaq O
. O

Finally O
after O
months O
of O
research O
the O
discovered O
that O
they O
mailed O
it O
to O
a O
Walmart O
and O
there O
probably O
would O
be O
no O
way O
to O
find O
the O
box O
. O

It O
does O
n't O
heat O
up O
like O
my O
old O
laptop O
. O

I O
always O
have O
used O
a O
tower O
home O
PC O
and O
jumped O
to O
the O
laptop O
and O
have O
been O
very O
satisfied O
with O
its O
performance B-AS
. O

It O
's O
solid O
. O

Before O
I O
got O
my O
macbook O
, O
I O
owned O
a O
Dell O
laptop O
. O

This O
laptop O
is O
the O
most O
amazing O
little O
peice O
of O
machinery O
I O
have O
owned O
outside O
of O
the O
Iphone O
. O

The O
computer O
runs B-AS
very O
fast O
with O
no O
problems O
and O
the O
iLife B-AS
software I-AS
that O
comes O
with O
it O
iPhoto B-AS
, O
iMovie B-AS
, O
iWeb B-AS
, O
iTunes B-AS
, O
GarageBand B-AS
is O
all O
very O
helpful O
as O
well O
. O

At O
first O
it O
worked O
well O
for O
a O
month O
or O
so O
then O
the O
system B-AS
board I-AS
failed O
and O
I O
send O
it O
in O
to O
toshiba O
some O
complaints O
and O
three O
weeks O
later O
I O
then O
receive O
my O
laptop O
back O
only O
to O
discover O
that O
it O
still O
has O
the O
same O
problem O
so O
now O
I O
have O
to O
send O
it O
back O
again O
to O
get O
it O
fixed O
again O
. O

Until O
I O
bought O
the O
Dell O
, O
I O
thought O
you O
just O
looked O
for O
what O
you O
wanted O
size B-AS
, O
software B-AS
, O
options O
, O
hardware B-AS
and O
purchase O
the O
best O
deal O
you O
could O
find O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
I O
could O
ever O
live O
without O
my O
Qousmio O
. O

It O
has O
plenty O
of O
memory B-AS
, O
lots O
of O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
, O
and O
great O
graphics B-AS
. O

It O
did O
n't O
take O
me O
long O
to O
get O
switched O
over O
to O
the O
Mac O
computer O
programs B-AS
and O
navigation B-AS
, O
it O
's O
been O
just O
fine O
and O
like O
the O
way O
this O
laptop O
functions O
much O
better O
. O

It O
lasted O
for O
many O
years O
of O
travel O
, O
kids O
and O
abuse O
and O
if O
I O
fired O
it O
up O
today O
, O
it O
would O
work O
. O

been O
a O
PC O
user O
for O
many O
, O
many O
years O
. O

I O
have O
never O
had O
any O
issues O
or O
problems O
with O
my O
MacBook O
Pro O
so O
far O
, O
and O
it O
is O
still O
as O
fast O
as O
it O
was O
when O
I O
first O
bought O
it O
. O

It O
freezes O
, O
and O
it O
always O
shows O
that O
there O
is O
an O
error O
, O
so O
I O
have O
to O
restart O
it O
a O
few O
times O
every O
time O
I O
use O
it O
. O

However O
, O
my O
girlfriend O
realized O
that O
the O
netbook O
's O
hinge B-AS
is O
a O
bit O
loose O
when O
you O
open O
or O
close O
the O
LCD B-AS
. O

My O
problem O
was O
with O
DELL B-AS
Customer I-AS
Service I-AS
. O

There O
are O
so O
many O
things O
wrong O
with O
this O
product O
, O
it O
just O
makes O
me O
want O
to O
set O
my O
self O
on O
fire O
! O

It O
is O
not O
even O
a O
year O
old O
yet O
, O
so O
I O
would O
definitely O
not O
recommend O
it O
to O
anyone O
. O

Amazing O
machine O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
do O
any O
high O
tech O
stuff O
on O
it O
, O
just O
write O
papers O
, O
check O
mail O
, O
and O
sometimes O
play O
games O
, O
so O
I O
ca O
n't O
reccomend O
it O
if O
you O
are O
in O
the O
computer O
field O
. O

Newegg O
's O
RMA B-AS
service I-AS
was O
great O
as O
always O
, O
I O
contacted O
them O
late O
Friday O
night O

me O
an O
RMA O

I O
' O
m O
very O
impressed O
. O

Dell O
sucks O

Design B-AS
, O
very O
durable O
. O

It O
is O
easy O
to O
go O
from O
one O

to O
another O

I O
spoke O
to O
4 O

MSN B-AS
Messenger I-AS
and O
a O
few O
other O

constantly O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

I O
have O
owned O
many O
computers O
and O
laptops O
. O

I O
recently O
purchased O
the O
mini O
and O
absolutely O
love O
it O
! O

Does O
a O
great O
job O
with O
video O
shot O
on O
a O
Canon O
5D O
MKII O
. O

I O
was O
told O
by O
many O
that O
it O
was O
a O
great O
computer O
, O
but O
we O
got O
one O
of O
these O
, O
and O
it O
worked O
great O
for O
one O
year O
, O
and O
as O
soon O
as O
the O
warrenty B-AS
was O
up O
, O
then O
it O
got O
really O
bad O
. O

I O
ve O
had O
to O
call O
tech B-AS
support I-AS
many O
times O
. O

The O
Apple B-AS
applications I-AS
exASPECT1 O
are O
fun O
, O
easy O
, O
and O
really O
cool O
to O
use O
unlike O
the O
competition O
! O
. O

Yes O
, O
I O
have O
it O
on O
the O
highest O
available O
setting O
. O

Not O
to O
mention O
it O
has O
shit O
gigs B-AS
. O

Hieroglyphics O
are O
quite O
common O
. O

This O
worked O
just O
fine O
. O

I O
paid O
for O
extra O
memory B-AS
and O
the O
17-inch B-AS
screen I-AS
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
top O
of O
the O
line O
DVD B-AS
and O
CD B-AS
burners I-AS
. O

Its O
pretty O
fast O
and O
does O
not O
have O
hiccups O
while O
I O
am O
using O
it O
for O
web B-AS
browsing I-AS
, O
uploading B-AS
photos I-AS
, O
watching B-AS
movies I-AS
720p O
on O
occasion O
and O
creating B-AS
presentations I-AS
. O

I O
was O
so O
happy O
with O
my O
new O
Mac O
. O

Quality B-AS
Display I-AS
I O
love O
HP O
, O
, O
it O
's O
the O
only O
computer O
/ O
printer O
we O
will O
buy O
. O

Despite O
the O
inconvenient O
weight O
, O
I O
opted O
for O
the O
12 B-AS
cell I-AS
battery I-AS
. O

My O
MacBook O
is O
faster O
than O
any O
comparable O
PC O
. O

The O
case B-AS
is O
carved O
out O
of O
a O
single O
block O
of O
aluminum O
. O

I O
' O
m O
very O
happy O
with O
this O
machine O
! O

I O
do O
not O
recommend O
this O
company O
or O
their O
products O
! O
! O
! O
! O

I O
like O
this O
machine O
because O
its O
very O
lightweight O
. O

First O
it O
burned O
or O
fused O
the O
power B-AS
adapter I-AS
plug I-AS
. O

the O
features B-AS
are O
great O
, O
the O
only O
thing O
it O
needs O
is O
better O
speakers B-AS
. O

It O
was O
still O
working O
, O
but O
there O
was O
nothing O
on O
the O
screen B-AS
. O

I O
bought O
this O
laptop O
and O
found O
its O
TAB B-AS
is O
not O
functioning O
. O

Toshiba O
is O
aware O
of O
the O
issue O
but O
unless O
the O
extended B-AS
warrenty I-AS
is O
bought O
Toshiba O
will O
do O
nothing O
about O
it O
. O

HP O
said O
I O
had O
done O
the O
damage O
. O

-Called O
headquarters O
again O
, O
they O
report O
that O
TFT B-AS
panel I-AS
is O
broken O
, O
should O
be O
fixed O
by O
the O
end O
of O
the O
week O
week O
3 O
. O

Navigation B-AS
through O
the O
computer O
is O
far O
superior O
compared O
to O
Windows B-AS
operating I-AS
systems I-AS
, O
as O
well O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
this O
product O
. O

If O
I O
had O
to O
buy O
another O
computer O
, O
I O
would O
most O
definetly O
buy O
an O
acer O
one O
computer O
. O

The O
screen B-AS
is O
framed O
by O
half O
to O
a O
full O
- O
inch O
margin O
that O
is O
obviously O
unnecessary O
, O
reduces O
the O
screen B-AS
size O
and O
increases O
the O
bulk B-AS
. O

Though O
the O
picture B-AS
, O
video B-AS
, O
and O
music B-AS
software I-AS
is O
nowhere O
close O
to O
professional O
grade O
software B-AS
I O
m O
used O
to O
CS5 O
but O
does O
the O
job O
for O
beginner O
and O
even O
intermediate O
media O
designers O
. O

I O
previously O
owned O
an O
HP O
desktop O
and O
a O
Dell O
laptop O
. O

Everything O
else O
just O
install O
and O
go O
. O

This O
thing O
is O
a O
lemon O
. O

My O
laptop O
is O
almost O
2yrs O
old O
and O
I O
have O
never O
had O
any O
problems O
with O
it O
. O

All O
the O
customers O
that O
come O
in O
hate O
Dell O
. O

We O
now O
own O
two O
of O
these O
, O
identical O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
already O
recommended O
this O
laptop O
to O
a O
friend O
who O
eye O
'd O
the O
computer O
when O
I O
took O
it O
out O
of O
my O
bag O
. O

I O
enjoy O
very O
much O
my O
new O
Toshiba O
, O
purchased O
specifially O
for O
attending O
online O
schooling O
. O

Once O
you O
go O
Mac O
, O
you O
ca O
n't O
go O
back O
! O

I O
brought O
this O
laptop O
last O
friday O
, O
and O
originally O
it O
worked O
fantastic O
. O

The O
much O
lauded O
combined B-AS
touch I-AS
pad I-AS
and I-AS
clicker I-AS
is O
a O
nightmare O
. O

The O
Unibody B-AS
construction I-AS
is O
solid O
, O
sleek O
and O
beautiful O
. O

They O
're O
easy O
, O
fun O
, O
powerful O
and O
will O
last O
a O
long O
time O
. O

I O
WANT O
MY O
L505-s5988 O
BACK O
! O

I O
let O
my O
friend O
borrow O
it O
, O
and O
she O
knows O
nothing O
about O
computers O
, O
and O
she O
used O
it O
with O
ease O
. O

This O
MacBook O
is O
an O
outstanding O
product O
with O
great O
value B-AS
. O

If O
that O
is O
the O
case O
for O
you O
, O
I O
would O
suggest O
a O
pull O
- O
behind O
solution O
when O
looking O
at O
cases O
. O

I O
had O
to O
re O
- O
install O
Windows B-AS
within O
two O
weeks O
of O
the O
purchase O
and O
soon O
discovered O
cracks O
in O
the O
screen B-AS
hinges I-AS
. O

A O
SECOND O
PROBLEM O
INVOLVES O
THE O
BATTERY B-AS
WHICH O
IS O
ADVERTISED O
AS O
HAVING O
A O
STORAGE O
LIFE O
OF O
11 O
HOURS O
BUT O
WHEN O
FULLY O
CHARGED O
SHOWS O
ONLY O
7 O
HOURS O
OF O
SERVICE B-AS
. O

and O
plenty O
of O
storage B-AS
with O
250 O
gbthough O
I O
will O
upgrade O
this O
and O
the O
ram B-AS
. O

I O
had O
to O
call O
Apple O
19 O
times O
each O
time O
40 O
to O
75 O
minutes O
on O
the O
phone O
, O
and O
take O
it O
to O
their O
store O
for O
evaluations O
, O
and O
diagnostics O
, O
5 O
times O
. O

No O
temporary O
replacement O
, O
they O
are O
out O
of O
replacements O
because O
many O
computers O
had O
problems O
with O
the O
Nvidia B-AS
chipset I-AS
status O
of O
repair O
. O

I O
took O
it O
to O
friend O
who O
temporarily O
fixed O
it O
and O
I O
finally O
paid O
about O
1500 O
for O
the O
extended B-AS
warranty I-AS
. O

I O
respond O
that O
I O
do O
not O
have O
the O
old O
computer O
. O

I O
homeschool O
my O
kids O
and O
with O
this O
netbook O
next O
to O
my O
desk O
we O
get O
to O
teaching O
and O
illustrating O
without O
skipping O
a O
beat O
. O

Programs B-AS
would O
crash O
all O
the O
time O
, O
and O
it O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
a O
very O
unstable O
, O
unreliable O
laptop O
for O
me O
. O

I O
BOUGHT O
THIS O
LAP O
TOP O
AND O
THE O
CHARGE B-AS
TIME I-AS
DOSE O
N'T O
LAST O
AS O
LONG O
AS O
THEY O
SAY O
IT O
WILL O
MORE O
LIKE O
2 O
HOURS O

Also O
, O
because O
of O
the O
size B-AS
and O
consistancy B-AS
of O
the O
laptop O
computer O
, O
some O
websites O
would O
n't O
even O
attempt O
to O
work O
on O
the O
computer O
because O
of O
browser O
problems O
. O

I O
work O
with O
kids O
and O
they O
love O
making O
short O
videos O
on O
there O
. O

It O
is O
very O
durable O
, O
I O
am O
pretty O
rough O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
electronics O
and O
it O
has O
taken O
it O
all O
with O
no O
reprecutions O
yet O
. O

the O
key B-AS
bindings I-AS
take O
a O
little O
getting O
used O
to O
, O
but O
have O
loved O
the O
Macbook O
Pro O
. O

Keyboard B-AS
is O
reasonable O
size B-AS
. O

Instead O
it O
is O
sitting O
in O
West O
Verginia O
waiting O
for O
UPS O
to O
take O
two O
days O
to O
send O
Me O
a O
box O
and O
Two O
days O
for O
them O
to O
ship O
the O
computer O
some O
691 O
miles O
by O
air O
? O
to O
Louisville O
Ky O
. O

I O
' O
m O
now O
trying O
to O
decide O
on O
another O
Dell O
model O
. O

I O
find O
myself O
using O
the O
10-key B-AS
more O
than O
I O
thought O
I O
would O
. O

The O
Macbook O
is O
a O
fantastic O
laptop O
. O

Fan B-AS
noise O
, O
The O
fan B-AS
made O
a O
constant O
hissing O
noise O
in O
the O
background O
. O

I O
believe O
this O
is O
because O
I O
was O
more O
active O
than O
the O
average O
user O
, O
meaning O
I O
average O
about O
three O
tabs O
. O

Best O
Buy O
Rocks O
! O

A O
couple O
things O
you O
should O
know O
, O

bought O
the O
first O
asus O
laptop O
in O
san O
francisco O
, O
returned O
it O
in O
santa O
maria O
, O
thinking O
it O
was O
just O
a O
problem O
with O
that O
computer O
. O

The O
screen B-AS
is O
bright O
and O
clear O
, O
the O
operating B-AS
system I-AS
is O
solid O
and O
friendly O
to O
a O
novice O
. O

It O
has O
a O
1 O
ghz O
faster O
processor B-AS
and O
a O
stock O
500 B-AS
gb I-AS
hard I-AS
drive I-AS
. O

The O
feature B-AS
are O
good O
enough O
for O
what O
I O
need O
. O

All O
the O
yada O
- O
yada O
. O

Finally O
, O
the O
biggest O
problem O
has O
been O
tech B-AS
support I-AS
. O

this O
laptop O
is O
great O
for O
work O
and O
doing O
my O
pictures O
. O

I O
had O
the O
computer O
for O
a O
full O
year O
and O
it O
was O
a O
new O
computer O
. O

This O
is O
n't O
a O
big O
deal O
, O
I O
have O
n't O
noticed O
the O
issue O
with O
DVDs O
or O
other O
media O
, O
only O
through O
USB B-AS
output I-AS
. O

I O
love O
it O
! O

With O
Windows O
laptops O
a O
wireless B-AS
mouse I-AS
is O
an O
absolute O
must O
. O

I O
had O
been O
a O
Windows B-AS
user O
before O
this O
I O
love O
the O
size B-AS
because O
the O
screen B-AS
is O
big O
enough O
for O
what O
I O
use O
it O
for O
Internet O
, O
artwork O
, O
and O
yet O
it O
is O
small O
enough O
to O
be O
reasonably O
portable O
. O

But O
if O
you O
're O
willing O
to O
pay O
another O
200 O
dollar O
for O
a O
windows B-AS
disc I-AS
. O

Very O
good O
quality B-AS
and O
well O
made O
. O

I O
bought O
a O
Logitech O
desktop O
set O
in O
anticipation O
for O
using O
with O
the O
MBP O
, O
but O
I O
use O
the O
touchpad B-AS
90 O
% O
of O
the O
time O
. O

When O
calling O
Dell O
for O
help O
, O
reurn O
, O
or O
a O
new O
computer O
they O
were O
not O
useful O
and O
left O
it O
up O
to O
myself O
to O
figure O
out O
what O
to O
do O
with O
it O
. O

Two O
of O
the O
times O
was O
in O
one O
month O
. O

So O
needless O
to O
day O
, O
I O
' O
m O
not O
happy O
. O

my O
niece O
and O
nephew O
have O
played O
a O
few O
web O
games O
and O
it O
runs O
anything O
that O
does O
n't O
require O
a O
dedicated O
video B-AS
card I-AS
. O

Although O
I O
was O
promised O
about O
10 O
hours O
, O
I O
found O
myself O
to O
a O
limited O
7 O
hours O
which O
is O
still O
amazing O
. O

It O
had O
the O
full O
sized O
touch B-AS
pad I-AS
with O
2 O
buttons O
instead O
of O
just O
one O
. O

It O
was O
also O
cheaper O
than O
the O
Pro O
which O
made O
it O
even O
more O
appealing O
to O
me O
. O

Typically O
, O
when O
I O
purchase O
a O
new O
laptop O
I O
always O
end O
up O
using O
an O
external B-AS
mouse I-AS
for O
convenience O
. O

Consumer O
Report O
recommended O
Toshiba O
. O

Needless O
to O
say O
I O
told O
them O
No O
and O
have O
a O
nice O
day O
and O
hung O
up O
! O

It O
was O
super O
easy O
to O
set B-AS
up I-AS
and O
Is O
really O
easy O
to O
get O
used O
to O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
can O
be O
updated O
is O
the O
video B-AS
, O
other O
than O
that O
you O
're O
all O
set O
. O

It O
was O
n't O
worth O
it O
. O

Its O
a O
good O
laptop O
for O
its O
value B-AS
. O

ANd O
I O
babyed O
the O
heck O
out O
of O
it O
just O
one O
day O
when O
i O
opened O
it O
turned O
it O
on O
went O
to O
click O
and O
it O
was O
broke O
. O

Probbly O
the O
worst O
decision O
we O
ever O
made O
! O

Then O
the O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
failed O
; O

This O
computer O
literally O
takes O
about O
five O
minutes O
to O
start O
up O
and O
to O
be O
able O
to O
use O
without O
it O
crawling O
and O
I O
DO O
mean O
crawling O
. O

I O
had O
less O
problems O
. O

It O
will O
be O
returned O
in O
the O
state O
to O
which O
it O
was O
shipped O
Michigan O
. O

Plain O
and O
simple O
, O
itlaptop O
runs B-AS
great O
and O
loads B-AS
fast O
. O

This O
machine O
rocks O
! O

of O
course O
my O
warranty B-AS
runs O
out O
next O
month O
. O

My O
next O
laptop O
will O
also O
be O
a O
Mac O
! O

But O
not O
in O
this O
case O
. O

taking O
notes O
, O
research O
, O
an O
online O
class O
and O
such O
and O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
spend O
too O
much O
on O
my O
first O
machine O
. O

The O
capabilities O
using O
that O
program B-AS
alone O
made O
me O
want O
a O
Mac O
. O

When O
I O
got O
this O
laptop O
in O
2007 O
to O
help O
me O
with O
school O
, O
I O
had O
a O
hard O
time O
from O
beginning O
. O

I O
do O
not O
know O
for O
sure O
. O

No O
machine O
has O
come O
remotely O
close O
to O
causing O
as O
many O
problems O
. O

Every O
single O
one O
we O
' O
ve O
gotten O
we O
' O
ve O
had O
problems O
with O
. O

it O
is O
the O
worst O
computer O
dell O
ever O
made O
. O

If O
you O
ever O
see O
the O
spinning B-AS
beachball I-AS
come O
up O
when O
you O
think O
it O
should O
n't O
, O
check O
the O
Activity O
Monitor O
app O
to O
see O
if O
the O
disk B-AS
throughput I-AS
has O
temporarily O
dropped O
to O
zero O
. O

I O
have O
found O
also O
, O
it O
is O
very O
easy O
to O
be O
able O
to O
access O
wireless B-AS
internet I-AS
access I-AS
; O

About O
1/2 O
of O
the O
sites O
I O
need O
to O
visit O
because O
of O
my O
work O
contain O
some O
type O
of O
Flash O

This O
is O
a O
great O
value B-AS
for O
the O
money O
. O

It O
was O
a O
great O
laptop O
, O
ran B-AS
great O
and O
was O
really O
fast O
. O

The O
battery B-AS
has O
never O
worked O
well O
. O

return O
it O
. O

I O
can O
guarantee O
this O
will O
be O
the O
last O
Dell O
I O
will O
ever O
purchase O
! O

They O
said O
it O
was O
a O
computer O
error O
on O
this O
type O
of O
computer O
. O

I O
will O
never O
buy O
another O
computer O
from O
Dell O
ever O
again O
do O
to O
how O
awful O
it O
worked O
and O
how O
I O
was O
treated O
by O
the O
company B-AS
. O

My O
review O
mainly O
talks O
about O
the O
difference O
I O
have O
felt O
between O
an O
early O
2011 O
and O
late O
2011 O
mac O
book O
pro O
. O

That O
was O
a O
big O
mistake O
. O

The O
only O
problem O
is O
a O
lack O
of O
screen B-AS
resolutions I-AS
! O

Small O
enough O
to O
use O
on O
a O
long O
flight O
, O
Light O
enough O
to O
carry B-AS
through O
airports O
and O
powerful O
enough O
to O
replace O
my O
desktop O
while O
on O
long O
business O
trips O
. O

Typing O
on O
the O
keyboard B-AS
becomes O
uncomfortable O
after O
extended O
use O
due O
to O
the O
sharp O
edges B-AS
that O
your O
wrists O
rest O
on O
. O

If O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
netbook O
pc O
DO O
NOT O
BUY O
FROM O
ASUS O
! O
! O
! O

It O
has O
many O
great O
programs B-AS
, O
such O
as O
ILife B-AS
, O
iPhotos B-AS
and O
others O
. O

Other O
Thoughts O
, O
Received O
replacement O
16 O
Days O
later O
. O

If O
the O
number O
of O
patrons O
in O
the O
Apple O
store O
are O
any O
indication O
, O
HP O
and O
other O
PC O
manufacturers O
need O
to O
take O
note O
. O

The O
processor B-AS
went O
on O
me O
, O
the O
fan B-AS
went O
and O
the O
motherboard B-AS
went O
. O

I O
bought O
my O
first O
MacBook O
after O
seeing O
the O
product O
demonstrated O
. O

It O
is O
very O
well O
built B-AS
. O

Might O
not O
make O
the O
avid O
gamer O
happy O
but O
I O
do O
n't O
really O
think O
that O
is O
what O
this O
computer O
is O
designed O
for O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
this O
laptop O
to O
anybody O
that O
wants O
great O
performance B-AS
from O
a O
laptop O
and O
would O
like O
to O
relax O
and O
not O
become O
enraged O
cursing O
the O
gods O
about O
to O
throw O
your O
laptop O
out O
the O
door O
. O

The O
screen B-AS
resolution I-AS
was O
exactly O
what O
I O
was O
looking O
for O
. O

Even O
though O
it O
is O
running O
Snow B-AS
Leopard I-AS
, O
24 O
GHz O
C2D O
is O
a O
bit O
of O
an O
antiquated O
CPU B-AS
and O
thus O
the O
occasional O
spinning B-AS
wheel I-AS
would O
appear O
when O
running O
Office B-AS
Mac I-AS
applications I-AS
such O
as O
Word B-AS
or O
Excel B-AS
. O

seriously O
why O
have O
n't O
they O
just O
replaced O
it O
by O
now O
. O

There O
is O
no O
number O
pad B-AS
to O
the O
right O
of O
the O
keyboard B-AS
which O
is O
a O
bummer O
. O

After O
20 O
- O
30 O
min O
the O
screen B-AS
of O
the O
notebook O
switched O
off O
. O

If O
upgrade O
is O
possible O
to O
the O
full O
Windows B-AS
7 I-AS
, O
then O
I O
will O
truly O
be O
a O
very O
happy O
geek O
. O

I O
have O
used O
both O
PCs O
and O
Macs O
and O
I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
I O
really O
really O
love O
my O
Mac O
Book O
Pro O
. O

I O
was O
originally O
concerned O
that O
I O
could O
n't O
view O
work O
I O
had O
done O
in O
college O
on O
my O
Mac O
because O
of O
the O
PC O
formatting O
, O
but O
I O
was O
even O
more O
thrilled O
to O
learn O
of O
programs B-AS
like O
iLife B-AS
and O
iWork B-AS
that O
allow O
you O
to O
convert O
your O
PC O
documents O
into O
readable O
files O
on O
Macs O
. O

It O
is O
a O
big O
big O
, O
but O
since O
it O
has O
a O
184 O
screen O
what O
would O
you O
expect O
! O
. O

I O
have O
never O
had O
an O
experience O
like O
this O
. O

We O
have O
n't O
had O
any O
problems O
with O
it O
at O
all O
. O

returned O
it O
to O
walmart O
. O

10 O
hours O
of O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
is O
really O
something O
else O
. O

I O
love O
everything O
about O
it O
. O

It O
's O
slow O
and O
one O
day O
i O
hope O
to O
have O
the O
money O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
it O
and O
buy O
something O
else O
. O

It O
meets O
all O
my O
needs O
for O
work O
and O
pleasure O
while O
traveling O
. O

Runs B-AS
fast O
and O
the O
regular B-AS
layout I-AS
keyboard I-AS
is O
so O
much O
better O
. O

All O
was O
well O
. O

All O
the O
programs B-AS
are O
easy O
and O
straight O
forward O
on O
my O
MacBook O
Pro O
, O
it O
is O
clean O
and O
organized O
, O
which O
I O
always O
strive O
to O
be O
myself O
. O

He O
said O
quite O
a O
number O
of O
people O
had O
encountered O
this O
problem O
and O
said O
it O
is O
a O
common O
issue O
. O

Not O
worth O
it O
one O
bit O
. O

I O
just O
ca O
n't O
fathom O
that O
the O
celebrated O
Dell O
would O
last O
a O
week O
in O
environment O
of O
free O
competition O
with O
normal O
products O
, O
it O
only O
survives O
b O
/ O
c O
its O
substandard O
laptops O
are O
forced O
onto O
captive O
students O
and O
employees O
through O
question O
- O
raising O
programs O
. O

Much O
of O
which O
HP O
ended O
up O
paying O
for O
. O

I O
reinstalled O
windows B-AS
through O
the O
recovery B-AS
discs I-AS
and O
everything O
seemed O
good O
again O
. O

Windows B-AS
7 I-AS
Starter I-AS
is O
terrific O
no O
you O
ca O
n't O
change O
the O
background O
but O
I O
do O
n't O
need O
to O
, O
I O
use O
it O
just O
for O
school O
work O
. O

Support B-AS
has O
been O
lackluster O
and O
now O
I O
just O
want O
a O
refund O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
they O
had O
no O
record O
of O
me O
having O
the O
3 B-AS
year I-AS
warranty I-AS
I O
'd O
paid O
almost O
$ O
400 O
for O
, O
and O
I O
had O
to O
call O
in O
, O
spend O
hours O
on O
their O
online B-AS
chat I-AS
service I-AS
, O
and O
fax O
in O
multiple O
documents O
. O

I O
hate O
to O
say O
this O
, O
but O
if O
I O
could O
take O
this O
back O
to O
the O
shop O
and O
get O
my O
money O
back O
, O
then O
I O
would O
. O

It O
makes O
doing O
schoolwork O
at O
night O
so O
much O
easier O
. O

Being O
only O
2 O
months O
old O
, O
I O
am O
not O
a O
happy O
camper O
! O

> O
iPhoto B-AS
is O
probably O
the O
best O
program O
I O
have O
ever O
worked O
with O
, O
easy O
and O
convenient O
. O

I O
love O
to O
write O
and O
play O
with O
graphics O
and O
html O
programming O
and O
my O
new O
Toshiba O
works B-AS
great O
on O
both O
! O

THis O
computer O
may O
be O
small O
but O
it O
is O
one O
heck O
of O
a O
power O
horse O
. O

They O
would O
repair O
one O
thing O
, O
send O
it O
back O
and O
it O
would O
still O
have O
the O
same O
problem O
. O

Such O
as O
PAGES O
, O
NUMBERS O
, O
and O
so O
on O
. O

My O
laptop O
now O
has O
no O
battery B-AS
. O

Beta O
had O
better O
quality O
, O
but O
VHS O
became O
the O
industry O
standard O
. O

It O
made O
the O
computer O
much O
easier O
to O
use B-AS
and O
navigate B-AS
. O

, O
-If O
you O
buy O
this O
, O
do O
n't O
go O
into O
it O
expecting O
7 O
hrs O
of O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
, O
and O
you O
'll O
be O
perfectly O
satisfied O
. O

Needs O
longer O
lasting O
battery B-AS
, O
More O
than O
1 O
to O
2 O
Hrs O
. O

in O
May O
I O
started O
having O
problems O
with O
the O
USB B-AS
ports I-AS
not O
working O
. O

10 O
plus O
hours O
of O
battery B-AS
. O

If O
only O
Bill O
Gates O
would O
read O
some O
of O
what O
is O
said O
here O
MS O
would O
do O
a O
better O
job O
. O

The O
design B-AS
is O
awesome O
, O
quality B-AS
is O
unprecedented O
. O

I O
' O
m O
going O
to O
try O
and O
keep O
my O
old O
G4 O
on O
the O
road O
for O
as O
long O
as O
possible O
. O

The O
Mac B-AS
version I-AS
of I-AS
Microsoft I-AS
Office I-AS
is O
cheaper O
than O
buying O
the O
actual O
and O
works O
just O
as O
well O
. O

The O
Mac O
takes O
about O
the O
same O
amount O
of O
starting B-AS
- I-AS
up I-AS
time I-AS
as O
the O
average O
PC O
, O
but O
keeps O
itself O
cleaned O
up O
and O
ready O
to O
use O
. O

Its O
hard O
to O
encounter O
a O
problem O
on O
a O
mac O
that O
would O
require O
such O
abrupt O
action O
. O

The O
Toshiba O
Net O
book O
operates B-AS
very O
well O
. O

I O
loved O
it O
. O

the O
touch B-AS
pad I-AS
is O
fine O
, O
again O
, O
it O
's O
a O
real O
touch B-AS
pad I-AS
. O

The O
pictures B-AS
are O
clear O
as O
can O
be O
. O

It O
is O
also O
very O
lightweight O
, O
making O
transporting B-AS
this O
computer O
very O
easy O
. O

If O
anything O
, O
I O
would O
only O
suggest O
using O
one O
of O
these O
laptops O
if O
only O
you O
have O
to O
. O

I O
sit O
down O
and O
use O
my O
husband O
's O
work O
PC O
and O
I O
do O
n't O
like O
it O
one O
bit O
. O

It O
's O
wonderful O
for O
computer O
gaming B-AS
. O

You O
have O
to O
toss O
out O
the O
wifi B-AS
card I-AS
and O
replace O
it O
just O
to O
have O
any O
sort O
of O
network B-AS
capability I-AS
. O

AND O
the O
best O
part O
is O
that O
it O
even O
comes O
with O
a O
free O
printer B-AS
when O
they O
have O
a O
certain O
promotion O
/ O
offer O
going O
, O
of O
course O
! O

the O
place O
we O
bought O
it O
from O
said O
that O
after O
they O
send O
it O
out O
to O
gateway O
4 O
times O
they O
would O
give O
us O
a O
new O
one O
. O

it O
is O
very O
easy O
for O
anyone O
to O
use B-AS
an O
apple O
and O
specially O
the O
mcbook O
pro O
notebook O
. O

I O
like O
it O
better O
than O
my O
big O
Dell O
Laptop O
. O

The O
flaws O
are O
, O
this O
computer O
is O
not O
for O
computer O
gamers O
because O
of O
the O
OS B-AS
X I-AS
. O

I O
tried O
giving O
it O
0 O
stars O
but O
I O
had O
to O
choose O
at O
least O
one O
, O
but O
IMO O
NO O
STARS O

They O
really O
do O
have O
the O
worlds O
very O
worst O
repair B-AS
service I-AS
. O

They O
need O
to O
stop O
outsoucing O
and O
send O
some O
complaint O
calls O
to O
US O
based O
customer B-AS
service I-AS
agents I-AS
for O
those O
who O
live O
in O
the O
United O
states O
. O

I O
was O
also O
able O
to O
install O
and O
use O
my O
Photoshop B-AS
and O
AfterEffects B-AS
programs I-AS
easily O
. O

It O
's O
perfect O
for O
everything O
and O
runs B-AS
faster O
than O
an O
average O
pc O
! O

for O
being O
so O
small O
it O
is O
amazing O
that O
it O
is O
as O
fast O
as O
it O
is O
. O

Heck O
, O
I O
like O
all O
Mac O
computers O
, O
but O
they O
're O
all O
WAY O
too O
pricey O
for O
the O
kind O
of O
economy O
the O
US O
is O
going O
through O
. O

Then O
after O
paying O
for O
it O
to O
be O
examined O
I O
was O
told O
it O
was O
same O
problem O
cited O
on O
website O
but O
I O
'd O
have O
to O
pay O
anyways O
since O
it O
was O
past O
warrenty B-AS
. O

They O
claim O
that O
I O
should O
be O
happy O
because O
I O
am O
getting O
a O
new O
laptop O
to O
replace O
my O
two O
- O
month O
old O
laptop O
. O

I O
' O
m O
already O
hooked O
on O
the O
sleek O
look B-AS
and O
dependability B-AS
that O
this O
laptop O
has O
shown O
. O

The O
machine O
itself O
is O
alright O
. O

It O
seems O
to O
have O
some O
opions O
that O
are O
intalled O
but O
do O
not O
work O
like O
I O
thought O
they O
would O
. O

And O
having O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
company B-AS
has O
been O
a O
even O
worse O
nightmare O
. O

I O
will O
definitely O
be O
getting O
a O
new O
laptop O
if O
it O
has O
any O
more O
issues O
after O
the O
warranty B-AS
expires O
and O
researching O
carefully O
when O
I O
do O
so O
I O
do O
n't O
run O
accross O
a O
situation O
like O
this O
again O
! O

I O
also O
experience O
the O
same O
with O
my O
MacBook O
Air O
. O

It O
has O
all O
the O
features B-AS
that O
are O
necessary O
for O
college O
and O
if O
not O
they O
are O
able O
to O
be O
added O
onto O
the O
computer O
. O

I O
have O
owned O
many O
different O
brands O
of O
laptops O
in O
my O
life O
. O

I O
did O
an O
internet O
search O
and O
this O
is O
a O
very O
common O
problem O
with O
this O
laptop O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
owned O
this O
labtop O
for O
less O
then O
two O
months O
, O
already O
the O
mouse B-AS
button I-AS
has O
broke O
. O

It O
did O
fairly O
well O
, O
other O
than O
it O
's O
poor O
performance B-AS
, O
overheating O
and O
occational O
blue O
screen O
. O

The O
touchpad B-AS
is O
very O
intuitive O
, O
so O
much O
so O
that O
I O
never O
want O
to O
use O
buttons B-AS
to O
click O
again O
! O

tons O
of O
bloatware O
and O
junk O
programs B-AS
. O

its O
sad O
because O
their O
commercials O
are O
great O
. O

lots O
of O
extra O
space B-AS
but O
the O
keyboard B-AS
is O
ridiculously O
small O
. O

Luckily O
, O
Dell O
said O
they O
would O
replace O
my O
laptop O
with O
a O
new O
one O
, O
but O
instead O
I O
got O
a O
refund O
and O
bought O
a O
mac O
. O

I O
decided O
to O
get O
this O
pile O
of O
crap O
on O
a O
whim O
and O
totally O
freaking O
regret O
it O
. O

Never O
been O
hacked O
. O

It O
's O
so O
bad O
that O
I O
' O
m O
thinking O
I O
only O
got O
half O
a O
battery B-AS
or O
something O
. O

Good O
keyboard B-AS
, O
long O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
, O
largest O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
and O
windows B-AS
7 I-AS
. O

I O
think O
it O
was O
seventy O
nine O
plus O
tax O
. O

In O
summary O
, O
take O
your O
money O
elsewhere O
. O

The O
processor B-AS
is O
very O
quick O
and O
effective O
as O
I O
load B-AS
webpages I-AS
and O
applications B-AS
. O

My O
battery B-AS
went O
bad O
about O
a O
year O
and O
a O
half O
after O
having O
it O
and O
it O
cost O
around O
eighty O
to O
a O
hundred O
dollars O
! O

I O
will O
NEVER O
buy O
Refurbished O
again O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
cae O
how O
cheap O
it O
is O
. O

It O
pretty O
much O
does O
everything O
we O
could O
ever O
need O
, O
and O
looks O
great O
to O
boot B-AS
. O

It O
is O
just O
slow O
slow O
slow O
. O

Bottom O
line O
, O
I O
doubt O
you O
'd O
be O
overly O
disappointed O
if O
you O
invest O
in O
this O
machine O
. O

As O
a O
lifelong O
Windows B-AS
user O
, O
I O
was O
extremely O
pleased O
to O
make O
the O
change O
to O
Mac O
. O

So O
, O
owing O
to O
these O
problems O
, O
I O
went O
out O
and O
got O
myself O
an O
Apple O
MacBook O
Pro O
, O
which O
I O
am O
using O
with O
great O
satisfaction O
at O
this O
very O
moment O
. O

The O
Macbook O
Pro O
is O
extremely O
thin O
and O
light O
compared O
to O
those O
heavy O
Windows O
Laptop O
. O

So O
this O
was O
great O
for O
me O
. O

This O
is O
the O
first O
macbook O
I O
have O
ever O
had O
. O

The O
acer O
one O
compuer O
is O
a O
great O
computer O
. O

another O
problem O
. O

The O
Macbook O
is O
also O
made O
better O
, O
my O
computer O
has O
never O
got O
a O
virus O
, O
and O
the O
laptop O
runs B-AS
just O
as O
fast O
as O
the O
first O
day O
I O
bought O
it O
. O

So O
, O
if O
you O
're O
thinking O
of O
a O
laptop O
, O
I O
would O
heartily O
recommend O
theApple O
133 O
MacBook O
Pro O
Notebook O
Computer O
Z0J80001 O
Notebook O
for O
all O
your O
needs O
! O
. O

I O
wiped O
nearly O
everything O
off O
of O
it O
, O
installed O
OpenOffice B-AS
and O
Firefox B-AS
, O
and O
I O
am O
operating O
an O
incredibly O
efficient O
and O
useful O
machine O
for O
a O
great O
price B-AS
. O

Overall O
I O
feel O
this O
netbook O
was O
poor O
quality B-AS
, O
had O
poor O
performance B-AS
, O
although O
it O
did O
have O
great O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
when O
it O
did O
work O
. O

I O
picked O
it O
out O
becaASPECT0 O
it O
was O
inexpensive O
$ O
400 O
and O
I O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
a O
good O
, O
easy O
to O
use B-AS
first O
laptop O
. O

MY O
ONLY O
PROBLEM O
IS O
I O
CAN O
NOT O
REG O
THE O
PRODUCT B-AS
KEY I-AS
. O

The O
Time O
remaining O
goes O
from O
4 O
hours O
plus O
to O
less O
than O
2 O
hours O
over O
the O
span O
of O
about O
10 O
minutes O
. O

Pay O
attention O
to O
the O
specs B-AS
if O
you O
want O
these O
options O
. O

Stupidly O
, O
mind O
- O
numbingly O
slow O
-- O
then O
I O
found O
it O
can O
only O
be O
loaded O
with O
2 O
GB O
* O
maximum O
* O
. O

It O
also O
does O
not O
have O
bluetooth B-AS
. O

Sure O
it O
has O
the O
one B-AS
touch I-AS
keys I-AS
but O
that O
was O
the O
best O
feature O
of O
the O
computer O
. O

I O
can O
do O
pretty O
much O
75 O
% O
of O
what O
I O
do O
on O
my O
desktop O
on O
my O
kitchen O
table O
. O

Being O
a O
PC O
user O
my O
whole O
life O
. O

great O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
. O

The O
real O
stand O
out O
on O
this O
computer O
is O
the O
feel O
of O
the O
keyboard B-AS
and O
it O
's O
speed B-AS
. O

At O
first O
, O
the O
computer O
seemed O
a O
great O
deal O
-- O
seemingly O
high O
- O
end O
specs B-AS
for O
a O
low O
, O
low O
price B-AS
. O

Delivery B-AS
was O
early O
too O
. O

During O
that O
time O
, O
I O
had O
to O
send O
it O
back O
3 O
times O
. O

Although O
I O
opted O
for O
the O
lowest O
end O
MacBook O
Pro O
, O
this O
thing O
holds O
its O
own O
. O

Love O
the O
stability B-AS
of O
the O
Mac B-AS
software I-AS
and O
operating B-AS
system I-AS
. O

And O
that O
probably O
explains O
why O
I O
' O
ve O
already O
had O
my O
SATA B-AS
controller I-AS
go O
bad O
within O
a O
year O
of O
buying O
it O
. O

I O
left O
the O
place O
angrily O
. O

I O
my O
wife O
is O
also O
now O
the O
proud O
owner O
of O
a O
Macbook O
as O
well O
! O

I O
' O
ve O
had O
a O
Toshiba O
laptop O
in O
the O
past O
; O

It O
's O
also O
very O
capable O
of O
doing O
moderate O
video B-AS
editing I-AS
although O
you O
may O
need O
the O
performance B-AS
boost O
of O
the O
larger O
MacBook O
Pros O
for O
heavy O
duty O
mobile O
video B-AS
editing I-AS
. O

ASUS O
said O
my O
net O
- O
book O
was O
working O
properly O
. O

I O
received O
this O
laptop O
as O
a O
gift O
and O
let O
me O
just O
tell O
you O
that O
its O
the O
worst O
. O

Very O
annoying O
. O

My O
main O
reason O
to O
convert O
was O
the O
imovie B-AS
program I-AS
. O

It O
has O
a O
faster O
processor B-AS
and O
more O
ram B-AS
. O

If O
you O
need O
an O
affordable O
, O
entry O
- O
level O
laptop O
, O
this O
will O
fit O
the O
bill O
. O

Laptops O
are O
usually O
used O
on O
the O
go O
, O
so O
why O
not O
give O
you O
a O
better O
battery B-AS
? O

I O
will O
never O
complain O
about O
the O
price O
since O
I O
believe O
you O
get O
what O
you O
pay O
for O
and O
my O
MacBook O
Pro O
was O
worth O
every O
dollar O
. O

I O
was O
n't O
a O
big O
fan O
of O
the O
Netbooks O
but O
this O
one O
was O
very O
well O
designed B-AS
. O

It O
may O
take O
a O
little O
getting O
used O
to O
but O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
viruses O
or O
other O
headaches O
. O

And O
the O
warranty B-AS
on O
this O
macbook O
pro O
can O
last O
up O
to O
5 O
years O
or O
1000 O
battery O
recharge O
cycles O
. O

I O
still O
have O
that O
stupid O
bluetooth B-AS
mouse I-AS
to O
! O

Would O
like O
more O
trendy O
, O
high O
tech O
features B-AS
. O

Keyboard B-AS
is O
great O
but O
primary O
and O
secondary O
control B-AS
buttons I-AS
could O
be O
more O
durable O
. O

Screen O
is O
a O
bit O
glossy O
, O
but O
that O
's O
not O
too O
bad O
. O

Received O
the O
product O
promptly O
and O
without O
any O
issues O
. O

It O
is O
so O
great O
, O
I O
can O
Hardly O
ever O
take O
my O
hands O
off O
it O
! O

I O
remind O
myself O
from O
time O
to O
time O
to O
take O
off O
my O
watch O
when O
ever O
I O
look O
at O
the O
small O
scratch O
that O
it O
has O
caused O
. O

I O
got O
it O
back O
again O
and O
was O
told O
the O
motherboard B-AS
had O
been O
replaced O
, O
so O
I O
was O
now O
on O
the O
SECOND O
motherboard B-AS
within O
3 O
months O
. O

But O
reasons O
we O
chose O
this O
Apple O
computer O
. O

Processor B-AS
, O
When O
compared O
to O
my O
3 O
week O
old O
Early O
2011 O
edition O
there O
I O
barely O
experience O
any O
difference O
in O
performance B-AS
23 O
GHz O
v O
/ O
s O
24 O
GHz O
. O

They O
say O
it O
could O
be O
the O
motherboard B-AS
again O
, O
but O
Dell O

I O
upgraded O
from O
a O
5 O
year O
old O
laptop O
and O
was O
amazed O
to O
find O
out O
that O
this O
computer O
is O
much O
slower O
then O
my O
old O
laptop O
. O

2nd O
Best O
computer O
in O
the O
world O
only O
one O
way O
this O
computer O
might O
become O
the O
best O
is O
that O
it O
needs O
to O
upgreade O
patches B-AS
to O
make O
less O
easier O
for O
people O
to O
hack O
into O

Love O
the O
speed B-AS
, O
especially O
! O

It O
could O
be O
a O
perfect O
laptop O
if O
it O
would O
have O
faster O
system B-AS
memory I-AS
and O
its O
radeon B-AS
5850 I-AS
would O
have O
DDR5 B-AS
instead O
of O
DDR3 B-AS
. O

Not O
only O
are O
the O
versions O
of O
these O
programs B-AS
able O
to O
be O
saved O
, O
worked O
on O
and O
opened O
on O
both O
a O
PC O
and O
Mac O
, O
the O
versions O
of O
these O
programs B-AS
on O
a O
Mac O
are O
graphically O
and O
functionally O
superior O
. O

By O
Air O
sounds O
more O
like O
by O
truck O
to O
Me O
. O

So O
far O
it O
has O
been O
five O
months O
since O
the O
last O
problem O
was O
fixed O
and O
I O
am O
PRAYING O
it O
has O
finally O
stopped O
. O

It O
's O
outstanding O
too O
. O

The O
speed B-AS
gives O
you O
the O
power O
to O
work O
on O
these O
projects O
seamlessly O
, O
and O
multiple O
at O
a O
time O
if O
you O
sowish O
. O

Awesome O
laptop O
and O
the O
perfect O
size B-AS
to O
carry O
around O
in O
college O
. O

So O
I O
' O
m O
disappointed O
in O
that O
because O
communicating O
with O
my O
relatives O
out O
of O
the O
area O
is O
a O
priority O
. O

A O
MONTH O
LATER O
, O
we O
reinstall O
the O
OS B-AS
( I-AS
Vista I-AS
) I-AS
. O

Some O
problems O
can O
be O
fixed O
if O
you O
purchase O
new O
software B-AS
, O
but O
there O
is O
no O
guarentee O
. O

My O
real O
problem O
with O
it O
? O
The O
statement O
of O
7 O
hour O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
is O
not O
just O
mere O
exaggeration O
- O
it O
's O
a O
lie O
. O

just O
chill O
and O
enjoy O
. O

The O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
is O
also O
relatively O
good O
. O

It O
is O
her O
first O
laptop O
and O
she O
is O
thrilled O
. O

I O
should O
have O
sent O
it O
back O
to O
them O
then O
. O

I O
definitely O
suggest O
getting O
an O
extended B-AS
warranty I-AS
, O
you O
will O
probably O
need O
it O
! O

If O
this O
would O
be O
your O
first O
Mac O
purchase O
then O
I O
would O
highly O
suggest O
that O
you O
take O
advantage O
of O
the O
class O
that O
they O
offer O
to O
learn O
about O
the O
differences O
between O
Mac O
and O
PC O
's O
. O

This O
laptop O
leaves O
alot O
to O
be O
desired O
, O
I O
have O
had O
it O
only O
5 O
months O
and O
have O
had O
to O
send O
it O
away O
to O
be O
repaired O
twice O
. O

I O
have O
found O
it O
very O
easy O
to O
use B-AS
, O
very O
imformative O
, O
wonder O
alerts O
and O
tutorials O
making O
it O
very O
easy O
for O
someone O
like O
me O
who O
is O
not O
exactly O
technologically O
advanced O
to O
learn O
to O
use B-AS
the O
various O
features B-AS
and O
programs B-AS
. O

I O
do O
n't O
have O
stupid O
pop B-AS
up I-AS
windows I-AS
even O
when O
I O
have O
pop B-AS
ups I-AS
blocked O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
wait O
5 O
minutes O
for O
a O
webpage O
to O
download O
, O
and O
best O
of O
all O
I O
can O
run O
all O
the O
web B-AS
programming I-AS
software I-AS
I O
need O
to O
use O
all O
at O
once O
without O
slowing O
me O
down O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
laptop O
so O
that O
the O
entire O
family O
had O
a O
computer O
in O
the O
living O
room O
; O

Do O
n't O
waste O
your O
money O
or O
time O
. O

It O
has O
spent O
more O
time O
in O
repair O
shops O
than O
i O
can O
possibly O
recount O
here O
. O

Memory B-AS
is O
upgradable O
. O

Web B-AS
access I-AS
through O
the O
3 B-AS
G I-AS
network I-AS
is O
so O
slow O
, O
it O
's O
very O
frustrating O
and O
VERY O
DISAPPOINTING O
. O

Well O
, O
I O
bought O
this O
laptop O
a O
month O
or O
two O
ago O
. O

My O
MacBook O
Pro O
has O
been O
a O
huge O
disappointment O
. O

Received O
all O
four O
in O
good O
order O
; O

The O
computer O
first O
started O
malfunctioning O
3 O
months O
after O
purchasing O
it O
. O

this O
is O
starting O
off O
good O
. O

The O
large O
screen B-AS
also O
helps O
when O
you O
are O
working O
in O
design B-AS
based I-AS
programs I-AS
like O
Adobe B-AS
Creative I-AS
Suite I-AS
. O

The O
only O
pro O
to O
this O
computer O
is O
it O
was O
under O
$ O
600 O
! O

Moral O
of O
the O
story O
, O
-Do O
not O
buy O
anything O
from O
companies B-AS
that O
do O
not O
respect O
their O
customers O
. O

This O
is O
my O
first O
Dell O
I O
heard O
their O
customer B-AS
service I-AS
was O
lacking O
and O
that O
they O
were O
working O
on O
improving O
it O
! O

As O
well O
as O
having O
the O
plug B-AS
in O
the O
computer O
come O
loose O
. O

Very O
small O
and O
portable O
I O
' O
ve O
had O
this O
netbook O
about O
12 O
hrs O
now O
and O
It O
's O
better O
than O
expected O
. O

She O
said O
Wal O
Mart O
rants O
and O
raves O
abouy O
carring O
Dell O
because O
it O
's O
a O
big O
name O
but O
they O
are O
a O
piece O
of O
garbage O
. O

NOT O
WITH O
APPLE O
. O

After O
3 O
pleasant O
weeks O
of O
use O
, O
the O
laptop O
just O
died O
. O

Each O
time O
taking O
about O
1 O
day O
or O
so O
. O

Second O
HDD B-AS
cover I-AS
has O
walls O
inside O
that O
need O
to O
be O
broken O
if O
you O
what O
to O
install O
one O
. O

If O
you O
want O
more O
information O
on O
macs O
I O
suggest O
going O
to O
applecom O
and O
heading O
towards O
the O
macbook O
page O
for O
more O
information O
on O
the O
applications B-AS
. O

So O
a O
couple O
of O
years O
later O
, O
I O
was O
a O
dumb O
college O
girl O
and O
had O
to O
have O
the O
wireless O
internet O
. O

This O
netbook O
went O
bad O
on O
me O
after O
3 O
days O
. O

Probably O
wo O
n't O
work O
either O
. O

Great O
product O
by O
Apple O
with O
the O
new O
great O
looking O
design B-AS
. O

I O
love O
the O
keyboard B-AS
. O

Probably O
as O
good O
as O
you O
can O
get O
in O
a O
netbook O
, O
does O
everything O
I O
ask O
for O
and O
has O
some O
very O
good O
unexpected O
pluses O
. O

Overall O
I O
am O
very O
satisfied O
with O
the O
purchase O
. O

In O
my O
line O
of O
work O
, O
I O
often O
have O
to O
take O
work O
home O
, O
and O
this O
makes O
it O
so O
easy O
. O

They O
told O
me O
to O
reprogram O
the O
computer O
, O
and O
I O
did O
n't O
need O
to O
do O
that O
, O
and O
I O
lost O
pictures O
of O
my O
oldests O
first O
2 O
years O
of O
her O
life O
. O

I O
use O
iphoto B-AS
all O
the O
time O
, O
which O
is O
a O
great O
program B-AS
for O
anyone O
who O
is O
into O
photography O
, O
amateurs O
and O
experts O
alike O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
laptop O
for O
my O
son O
in O
2007 O
for O
his O
Christmas O
present O
. O

It O
took O
so O
much O
time O
. O

I O
hate O
it O
. O

The O
screen O
is O
n't O
huge O
, O
but O
that O
does O
n't O
matter O
when O
I O
output O
media O
to O
the O
50 O
inch O
LCD O
TV O
. O

I O
'll O
stick O
to O
Tashiba O
. O

I O
will O
have O
to O
purchase O
Spy B-AS
ware I-AS
or O
Nortell B-AS
for O
privacy O
protection O
. O

You O
will O
not O
regret O
buying O
such O
a O
great O
thing O
like O
this O
! O

I O
was O
said O
it O
's O
videocard B-AS
. O

Plus O
stylish O
. O

For O
the O
price B-AS
and O
what O
I O
get O
out O
of O
it O
has O
exceeded O
my O
expectations O
. O

And O
, O
if O
you O
are O
going O
to O
deal O
with O
HP O
be O
careful O
. O

I O
took O
the O
computer O
into O
Best O
Buy O
where O
I O
purchased O
it O
and O
they O
kept O
it O
over O
night O
to O
study O
it O
. O

If O
your O
time O
is O
worth O
anything O
to O
you O
, O
if O
you O
are O
tired O
of O
rebooting O
, O
reformatting O
, O
reinstalling O
, O
trying O
to O
find O
drivers B-AS
, O
if O
you O
want O
a O
computer O
to O
work O
for O
you O
for O
a O
change O
, O
make O
the O
change O
to O
this O
computer O
. O

My O
MacBook O
Pro O
is O
no O
exception O
. O

Unless O
you O
do O
n't O
care O
how O
long O
it O
takes O
to O
get O
going O
, O
find O
something O
else O
. O

You O
may O
be O
reading O
one O
now O
! O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
wish O
is O
the O
15 O
inch O
MacBook O
Pro O
has O
much O
better O
speakers B-AS
on O
the O
side O
of O
the O
keyboard B-AS
. O

I O
will O
have O
to O
say O
that O
I O
love O
my O
MacBook O
Pro O
! O

In O
fact O
, O
he O
said O
, O
about O
10 O
% O
of O
their O
products O
fail O
. O

This O
is O
the O
first O
Apple O
product O
that O
I O
have O
purchased O
. O

Now O
, O
as O
easy O
as O
it O
is O
to O
use B-AS
, O
and O
I O
do O
think O
it O
is O
a O
great O
STARTER O
laptop O
. O

This O
causes O
my O
wrist O
to O
scrape O
up O
against O
it O
. O

Enough O
said O
. O

Setting B-AS
would O
change O
for O
some O
reason O
, O
the O
screen B-AS
size I-AS
would O
change O
on O
it O
's O
own O
, O
like O
the O
pixel B-AS
sizes I-AS
and O
whatnot O
. O

It O
had O
some O
kind O
of O
pre B-AS
installed I-AS
software I-AS
update I-AS
that O
completely O
shut O
the O
computer O
down O
when O
you O
clicked O
it O
. O

Ever O
since O
I O
bought O
this O
laptop O
, O
so O
far O
I O
' O
ve O
experience O
nothing O
but O
constant O
break O
downs O
of O
the O
laptop O
and O
bad O
customer B-AS
services I-AS
I O
received O
over O
the O
phone O
with O
toshiba O
customer B-AS
services I-AS
hotlines O
. O

I O
do O
not O
plan O
on O
going O
back O
. O

No O
laptop O
is O
perfect O
, O
but O
sometimes O
you O
just O
find O
a O
computer O
that O
works O
for O
you O
. O

I O
really O
like O
the O
Mac O
154 O
in O
Notebook O
, O
but O
its O
very O
pricey O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
space B-AS
bar I-AS
makes O
a O
noisy O
click O
every O
time O
you O
use O
it O
. O

iPhotos B-AS
is O
an O
excellent O
program B-AS
for O
storing O
and O
organizing O
photos O
. O

Other O
than O
that O
its O
a O
great O
performing B-AS
machine O
and O
well O
meets O
all O
my O
needs O
and O
more O
. O

We O
were O
occasional O
Mac O
users O
before O
, O
but O
most O
recently O
owned O
a O
budget O
PC O
since O
it O
is O
what O
we O
could O
afford O
. O

Called O
tech O
support O
and O
got O
the O
usual O
Acer O
We O
do O
n't O
support O
software B-AS
but O
for O
$ O
$ O
$ O
we O
can O
help O
you O
I O
explained O
there O
was O
no O
software B-AS
involved O
in O
booting B-AS
. O

I O
would O
never O
tell O
anyone O
to O
buy O
one O
either O
. O

The O
programs B-AS
are O
great O
, O
like O
iphoto B-AS
love O
the O
editing O
capabilities O
, O
imail B-AS
which O
can O
incorporate O
with O
the O
address O
book O
on O
the O
ipod O
and O
ipad O
, O
imovie B-AS
, O
etc O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
did O
n't O
learn O
in O
my O
research O
was O
the O
software B-AS
I O
would O
need O
like O
privacy O
protection O
and O
warranty O
protection O
, O
in O
case O
it O
gets O
broken O
, O
or O
crashes O
etc O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
say O
enough O
good O
for O
it O
! O

Comfterbale O
to O
use B-AS
light O
easy O
to O
transport B-AS
. O

The O
Computer O
itself O
is O
a O
good O
product O
but O
the O
repair B-AS
depot I-AS
stinks O
. O

I O
thought O
the O
price B-AS
was O
great O
for O
the O
specs B-AS
. O

I O
was O
tired O
of O
going O
without O
my O
laptop O
every O
few O
weeks O
. O

the O
only O
down O
fall O
is O
that O
it O
has O
no O
cd B-AS
drive I-AS
but O
i O
found O
that O
they O
are O
very O
cheap O
to O
by O
and O
also O
very O
portable O
making O
this O
the O
best O
friend O
to O
someone O
who O
is O
always O
looking O
for O
more O
space O
then O
they O
have O
. O

So O
, O
the O
hard B-AS
disk I-AS
capacity I-AS
really O
does O
n't O
matter O
to O
me O
. O

Just O
for O
a O
stupid O
CD O
. O

Keys B-AS
stick O
periodically O
and O
I O
have O
nt O
had O
the O
laptop O
for O
45 O
days O
yet O
. O

It O
crashes O
, O
and O
when O
it O
goes O
flat O
, O
it O
just O
DIES O
like O
a O
PC O
, O
maybe O
worse O
and O
I O
loose O
all O
my O
open O
documents O
! O

I O
also O
like O
that O
you O
can O
scroll O
down O
in O
a O
window O
using O
two O
fingers O
on O
the O
trackpad B-AS
. O

Everything O
from O
the O
design B-AS
to O
the O
OS B-AS
is O
simple O
and O
to O
the O
point O
. O

I O
am O
now O
making O
a O
point O
to O
avoid O
their O
products O
and O
I O
hope O
my O
experience O
can O
serve O
as O
a O
warning O
to O
you O
as O
well O
. O

I'v O
spent O
as O
much O
for O
shipping B-AS
as O
I O
would O
to O
buy O
a O
new O
netbook O
- O
of O
course O
a O
different O
brand O
. O

I O
personally O
like O
the O
gaming B-AS
look I-AS
but O
needed O
a O
machine O
that O
delivered O
gaming B-AS
performance I-AS
while O
still O
looking O
professional O
in O
front O
of O
my O
customers O
. O

This O
just O
keeps O
having O
it O
's O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
replaced O
! O

When O
you O
look O
at O
the O
specs O
on O
Apple O
products O
in O
comparison O
to O
a O
Dell O
or O
a O
HP O
, O
yes O
they O
do O
seem O
to O
offer O
less O
for O
a O
higher O
cost B-AS
. O

Then O
I O
proceed O
to O
tell O
her O
that O
I O
checked O
out O
other O
retail O
stores O
that O
carry O
the O
netbook O
and O
it O
was O
n't O
LIKE O
THAT O
. O

Then O
they O
had O
me O
jump O
through O
many O
hoops O
and O
questions O
to O
see O
if O
they O
could O
find O
another O
way O
to O
invalidate O
me O
. O

The O
only O
downfall O
is O
the O
volume B-AS
control I-AS
. O

Clearly O
, O
there O
is O
something O
wrong O
with O
the O
product O
and O
LG O
did O
n't O
take O
up O
the O
responsibility O
. O

Very O
fast O
boot B-AS
up I-AS
and O
shut B-AS
down I-AS
. O

Right O
out O
of O
the O
box O
, O
this O
little O
netbook O
did O
everything O
I O
asked O
of O
it O
, O
including O
streaming O
the O
everyday O
video O
you O
're O
bound O
to O
encounter O
checking O
mail O
and O
websites O
my O
biggest O
complaint O
previously O
. O

I O
am O
very O
happy O
with O
this O
laptop O
. O

this O
laptop O
is O
durable O
and O
it O
is O
easy O
to O
travel O
with O
. O

I O
finally O
decided O
on O
this O
laptop O
because O
it O
was O
the O
right O
price B-AS
for O
what O
I O
need O
it O
. O

What O
a O
mistake O
! O

If O
internet B-AS
connectivity I-AS
is O
important O
I O
would O
recommend O
going O
with O
a O
dell O
net O
book O
for O
50 O
bucks O
more O
, O
or O
buy O
a O
USB B-AS
wireless I-AS
card I-AS
. O

I O
had O
read O
online O
that O
some O
users O
were O
having O
sound B-AS
problems O
. O

My O
last O
computer O
, O
a O
Toshiba O
, O
cost B-AS
only O
$ O
400 O
, O
and O
worked O
like O
a O
charm O
for O
many O
years O
. O

It O
discharges B-AS
too O
quickly O
. O

But O
to O
be O
honest O
, O
the O
compatibility B-AS
issues O
and O
the O
other O
little O
quirks O
make O
me O
think O
I O
ll O
buy O
a O
PC O
next O
time O
. O

three O
years O
is O
a O
decent O
life O
, O
but O
this O
must O
make O
it O
to O
graduation O
and O
beyond O
. O

I O
work O
on O
a O
PC O
at O
home O
and O
have O
used O
Pc O
all O
through O
college O
. O

TOSHIBA O
WILL O
NOT O
ACKNOWLEDGE O
THIS O
PROBLEM O
. O

Then O
it O
ceased O
charging B-AS
at O
all O
. O

An O
absolutely O
hateful O
machine O
that O
no O
one O
should O
get O
of O
their O
own O
free O
will O
. O

I O
do O
not O
experience O
a O
lot O
of O
heat O
coming O
out O
of O
it O
, O
however O
I O
would O
highly O
suggest O
purchasing O
a O
stand B-AS
however O
, O
due O
to O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
design B-AS
of O
the O
macbook O
as O
it O
is O
one O
very O
large O
heat B-AS
sink I-AS
. O

* O
is O
a O
bit O
laggy O
, O
not O
the O
greatest O
. O

I O
am O
not O
much O
of O
a O
computer O
techie O
, O
so O
I O
can O
understand O
some O
of O
the O
internal O
problems O
, O
though O
I O
do O
have O
trend B-AS
micro I-AS
as O
an O
antiviral B-AS
program I-AS
. O

Stay O
away O
from O
HP O
. O

The O
computer O
continued O
to O
give O
me O
issues O
and O
in O
Late O
June O
it O
completely O
died O
again O
and O
I O
tried O
to O
call O
Acer O
again O
to O
get O
it O
fixed O
and O
they O
refused O
to O
help O
me O
, O
they O
said O
my O
warrenty B-AS
was O
up O
and O
hung O
up O
on O
me O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
have O
n't O
had O
any O
major O
problems O
with O
the O
laptop O
except O
that O
the O
plastic B-AS
piece I-AS
that O
covers O
the O
usb B-AS
port I-AS
wires I-AS
have O
all O
come O
off O
. O

Wonderful O
sleek O
case B-AS
design I-AS
is O
only O
on O
the O
outside O
. O

It O
is O
speedy O
when O
connected O
wirelessly O
to O
any O
network O
regardless O
if O
the O
connection B-AS
is O
weak O
or O
not O
. O

I O
like O
it O
! O

The O
pricing B-AS
is O
very O
competitive O
. O

so O
we O
got O
a O
good O
deal O
on O
hsn O
for O
an O
ascer O
notebook O
and O
we O
bought O
it O
for O
him O
. O

Connecting O
to O
my O
wireless O
router O
via O
built B-AS
- I-AS
in I-AS
wireless I-AS
took O
no O
time O
at O
all O
. O

Its O
still O
going O
. O

This O
computer O
is O
exceptionally O
thin O
for O
it O
's O
screen B-AS
size I-AS
and O
processing B-AS
power I-AS
. O

There O
is O
NO O
way O
I O
will O
buy O
a O
LG O
product O
in O
the O
future O
. O

I O
have O
not O
had O
a O
problem O
with O
the O
applications B-AS
quitting O
or O
freezing O
. O

Prior O
to O
this O
computer O
, O
I O
owned O
a O
PowerBook O
G4 O
for O
6 O
years O
quite O
a O
long O
time O
for O
a O
laptop O
. O

Maybe O
this O
is O
virus O
related O
, O
maybe O
not O
, O
but O
the O
computer O
has O
locked O
up O
many O
times O
, O
and O
on O
two O
occasions O
, O
the O
screen B-AS
has O
simply O
gone O
black O
. O

The O
advantages O
of O
owning O
a O
mac O
are O
numerous O
. O

I O
challenge O
anyone O
to O
show O
proof O
that O
through O
anywhere O
near O
normal O
use O
can O
get O
more O
than O
25 O
hrs O
out O
of O
it O
. O

Using O
this O
machine O
is O
like O
a O
mild O
form O
of O
torture O
. O

This O
wiped O
out O
several O
programs B-AS
that O
were O
installed O
on O
the O
computer O
when O
it O
was O
bought O
. O

On O
the O
twelfth O
day O
that O
I O
had O
the O
notebook O
, O
I O
decided O
to O
go O
to O
Dell O
's O
website O
and O
update O
it O
. O

The O
computer O
blinks O
it O
shuts O
off O
at O
will O
. O

Excellent O
product O
for O
the O
money O
. O

It O
's O
graphics B-AS
are O
n't O
bad O
at O
all O
, O
for O
the O
lower O
end O
of O
the O
MacBook O
Pro O
spectrum O
, O
easily O
capable O
of O
running O
StarCraft O
II O
and O
other O
games O
with O
comparable O
graphics B-AS
. O

I O
have O
Vista B-AS
, O
so O
I O
am O
unable O
to O
install B-AS
and O
unASPECT2 O
some O
programs B-AS
. O

The O
screen B-AS
is O
bright O
and O
vivid O
and O
the O
keyboard B-AS
is O
very O
easy O
to O
use O
, O
very O
important O
for O
use O
quick O
typers O
. O

I O
can O
do O
everything O
I O
could O
before O
, O
only O
faster O
and O
more O
efficiently O
. O

I O
called O
Toshiba O
and O
they O
want O
me O
to O
be O
without O
my O
laptop O
for O
about O
two O
weeks O
while O
they O
look O
at O
the O
problem O
. O

the O
mouse B-AS
jumps O
around O
all O
the O
time O
and O
it O
clicks O
stuff O
i O
do O
n't O
want O
it O
too O
. O

i O
do O
n't O
understand O
why O
i O
spent O
twice O
as O
much O
to O
get O
a O
laptop O
rather O
than O
a O
desktop O
when O
my O
lap O
top O
is O
completely O
immoble O
. O

For O
those O
that O
care O
about O
noise B-AS
this O
thing O
does O
n't O
really O
make O
any O
; O

Here O
we O
are O
another O
year O
later O
and O
the O
computer O
is O
doing O
the O
same O
thing O
. O

Despite O
the O
plethora O
of O
problems O
, O
I O
managed O
to O
use O
technological O
trickery O
to O
keep O
the O
machine O
operational O
for O
two O
years O
. O

I O
had O
my O
IWORKS B-AS
, O
Itunes B-AS
, O
Email O
, O
MS B-AS
Office I-AS
, O
network O
and O
printers O
set O
up O
and O
completely O
working O
perfectly O
within O
an O
hour O
. O

Simply O
amazing O
computer O
! O
! O

I O
first O
purchased O
this O
Dell O
model O
1764 O
on O
April O
6 O
, O
201 O

The O
macbooks O
are O
small O
enough O
to O
be O
very O
portable O
yet O
hold O
tons O
of O
information O
and O
performance B-AS
. O

Two O
times O
with O
in O
one O
month O
. O

The O
only O
downfall O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
the O
software B-AS
I O
have O
wo O
n't O
work O
with O
Mac O
and O
iWork B-AS
is O
not O
worth O
the O
price B-AS
of O
it O
. O

Waited O
on O
getting O
this O
computer O
, O
but O
it O
has O
been O
a O
great O
change O
. O

For O
my O
burn O
thigh O
which O
has O
put O
a O
permanent O
mark O
on O
my O
skin O
it O
happened O
7 O
months O
ago O
they O
offered O
me O
an O
ITouch O
8Gig O
you O
know O
it O
is O
a O
bit O
insulating O
when O
a O
company O
this O
rich O
, O
offer O
a O
loyal O
customer O
like O
me O
, O
a O
bottom O
of O
their O
product O
line O
as O
a O
gift O
for O
events O
like O
this O
. O

Whenever O
tried O
to O
turn O
it O
on O
, O
it O
would O
restart O
as O
soon O
as O
the O
BIOS B-AS
launched O
Windows B-AS
or O
Winblows O
, O
as O
I O
like O
ot O
call O
it O
. O

BUT O
there O
's O
this O
application B-AS
called O
Boot B-AS
Camp I-AS
which O
allows O
you O
to O
add O
another O
OS B-AS
X I-AS
like O
Windows B-AS
. O

The O
mousepad B-AS
is O
a O
huge O
pain O
in O
the O
arse O
! O

I O
hope O
to O
edit O
this O
in O
the O
next O
few O
hours O
, O
I O
am O
going O
to O
try O
to O
install O
my O
own O
copy O
of O
Windows B-AS
7 I-AS
. O

If O
it O
's O
not O
shipped O
on O
the O
next O
business O
day O
, O
called O
on O
a O
Friday O
they O
are O
closed O
on O
weekends O
, O
what O
was O
the O
next O
step O
. O

I O
also O
purchased O
Applecare B-AS
for O
$ O
300 O
, O
which O
is O
a O
three O
year O
extended B-AS
warranty I-AS
, O
since O
I O
ve O
never O
seen O
any O
laptop O
that O
lasted O
more O
than O
two O
. O

I O
have O
had O
the O
netbook O
for O
2 O
months O
and O
I O
love O
it O
, O
I O
read O
some O
reviews O
that O
say O
netbooks O
are O
slow O
but O
it O
does O
not O
seem O
any O
slower O
than O
the O
other O
computers O
I O
use O
. O

I O
run O
windows B-AS
via O
bootcamp B-AS
for O
the O
couple O
programs B-AS
I O
do O
not O
want O
to O
buy O
a O
mac O
version O
of O
, O
like O
my O
cad O
programs B-AS
. O

C'm O
on O
, O
LG O
. O

Whenever O
I O
call O
Dell O
about O
an O
unrelated O
problem O
, O
they O
ask O
me O
if O
my O
laptop O
is O
running O
slowly O
and O
if O
I O
'd O
like O
to O
purchase O
more O
memory B-AS
for O
$ O
75 O
. O

since O
then O
i O
have O
had O
minor O
problems O
with O
slow O
operation B-AS
. O

If O
you O
faintly O
come O
close O
to O
touching O
this O
thing O
while O
typing O
, O
all O
craziness O
may O
break O
loose O
. O

Registration/1st O
use B-AS
is O
easy O
. O

I O
love O
this O
laptop O
, O
and O
use O
it O
everyday O
to O
do O
something O
, O
and O
never O
lets O
me O
down O
. O

Finally O
was O
able O
to O
reach O
a O
young O
lady O
in O
California O
and O
ordered O
the O
machine O
and O
was O
subsequently O
given O
a O
delivery O
date O
. O

I O
definitely O
will O
buy O
a O
Mac O
again O
if O
and O
when O
this O
computer O
ever O
fails O
. O

The O
Toshiba O
Mini O
Notebook O
, O
Model O
NB O
305-N410BL O
, O
is O
a O
great O
little O
computer O
. O

Take O
your O
time O
and O
go O
through O
the O
tutorials B-AS
patiently O
. O

So O
if O
anyones O
looking O
to O
buy O
a O
computer O
or O
laptop O
you O
should O
stay O
far O
far O
away O
from O
any O
that O
have O
the O
name O
TOSHIBA O
on O
it O
. O

I O
' O
m O
an O
excellent O
touch O
typist O
, O
and O
my O
hands O
are O
very O
sensitive O
, O
too O
. O

This O
time O
the O
mouse B-AS
pad I-AS
and O
right B-AS
click I-AS
key I-AS
would O
n't O
work O
! O

EVENTUALLY O
we O
pushed O
hard O
enough O
to O
convince O
them O
that O
this O
was O
the O
MACHINE O
that O
was O
causing O
the O
problems O
. O

The O
first O
full B-AS
charge I-AS
of O
this O
battery B-AS
got O
me O
only O
about O
2 O
full O
hours O
. O

I O
bought O
a O
cordless B-AS
mouse I-AS
for O
it O
, O
but O
do O
n't O
always O
take O
it O
out O
; O

When O
I O
got O
it O
, O
I O
immediately O
noticed O
that O
it O
was O
quite O
heavy O
and O
thick O
and O
not O
really O
attractive O
. O

It O
is O
sleek O
, O
smooth O
, O
and O
lightweight O
. O

i O
am O
a O
huge O
computer O
person O
i O
love O
anykind O
of O
computer O
that O
works O
well O
, O
but O
when O
i O
got O
this O
one O
i O
was O
so O
happy O
with O
the O
way O
it O
works O
and O
how O
it O
runs B-AS
its O
amazing O
. O

It O
took O
Toshiba B-AS
tech I-AS
support I-AS
4 O
calls O
and O
4 O
different O
techs B-AS
to O
correct O
the O
problem O
. O

They O
only O
stay O
charged B-AS
a O
little O
over O
an O
hour O
. O

Now O
they O
are O
believers O
in O
the O
product O
. O

Had O
to O
have O
this O
computer O
repaired O
twice O
in O
the O
first O
5 O
months O
after O
purchasing O
it O
. O

Hewlett O
Packard O
HP O
Pavillion O
DV6000 O
Laptop O
is O
the O
worst O
laptop O
we O
have O
ever O
bought O
. O

I O
had O
never O
owned O
a O
Mac O
before O
; O

The O
4 O
USB O
ports O
are O
nice O
, O
but O
the O
two O
on O
the O
side O
only O
work O
now O
and O
then O
. O

I O
could O
not O
find O
a O
phone O
number O
anywhere O
to O
call O
an O
actual O
live O
person O
for O
tech B-AS
support I-AS
and O
had O
to O
result O
the O
their O
online B-AS
chat I-AS
. O

i O
try O
to O
use O
it O
today O
and O
I O
ca O
n't O
logon O
. O

Keyboard B-AS
could O
use O
some O
trimming O
. O

The O
bottom O
- O
line O
is O
that O
this O
laptop O
just O
is O
n't O
worth O
it O
. O

I O
returned O
the O
computer O
to O
HP O
and O
they O
kept O
it O
for O
3 O
months O
. O

Its O
white O
color B-AS
is O
stylish O
for O
college O
students O
and O
easy O
to O
take O
to O
carry O
and O
take O
to O
classes O
. O

Returned O
laptop O
for O
repair O
a O
2nd O
time O
and O
it O
came O
back O
with O
obvious O
physical O
damage O
keyboard B-AS
bulging O
and O
speaker B-AS
grill I-AS
pressed O
in O
, O
buttons B-AS
not O
working O
and O
USB B-AS
ports I-AS
inoperative O
. O

When O
I O
am O
next O
to O
my O
router O
on O
my O
HP O
I O
get O
full O
service O
, O
on O
my O
Eee O
PC O
I O
get O
3 O
bars O
. O

I O
got O
assurances O
from O
2 O
different O
people O
that O
the O
remaining O
10 O
months O
of O
my O
warranty B-AS
would O
transfer O
to O
the O
new O
computer O
. O

Pretty O
disappointed O
about O
this O
product O
. O

The O
letter B-AS
A I-AS
stopped O
working O
after O
the O
first O
week O
. O

By O
the O
time O
I O
was O
finally O
able O
to O
get O
a O
work O
order O
to O
get O
it O
fixed O
I O
had O
been O
without O
my O
computer O
for O
almost O
a O
week O
while O
I O
was O
an O
Online O
College O
Student O
, O
so O
it O
was O
very O
inconvenient O
and O
I O
had O
to O
send O
it O
off O
and O
be O
without O
it O
while O
it O
was O
being O
fixed O
also O
. O

It O
out O
performs O
any O
other O
laptop O
on O
the O
market O
today O
. O

This O
is O
what O
I O
call O
a O
good O
after B-AS
sales I-AS
service I-AS
. O

Maybe O
it O
's O
Acer O
, O
maybe O
it O
's O
MSFT O
. O

So O
if O
you O
want O
a O
good O
machine O
that O
does O
almost O
anything O
this O
is O
the O
one O
, O
if O
you O
want O
a O
low O
budget O
computer O
then O
look O
at O
the O
other O
great O
brands O
Best O
Buy O
sells O
. O

I O
took O
off O
a O
star O
because O
the O
machine O
has O
a O
lot O
of O
junk O
software B-AS
on O
it O
. O

I O
would O
buy O
one O
of O
these O
for O
every O
person O
in O
my O
office O
if O
I O
could O
. O

With O
what O
I O
do O
know O
how O
to O
do O
, O
the O
computer O
works B-AS
beautiful O
. O

HAVING O
HAD O
EXPERIENCE O
WITH O
A O
TOSHIBA O
LAPTOP O

I O
WAS O
DISAPPOINTED O
TO O
FIND O
THAT O
THE O
TOSHIBA O
NB305 O
LAPTOP O
HAS O
MAJOR O
PROBLEMS O
. O

Tried O
to O
make O
a O

I O

For O
the O

price B-AS
, O
you O
get O
a O
lot O
more O
in O
the O

I O
made O
a O
photo O
book O
as O
a O
gift O
, O
on O
my O
computer O
, O
pushed O
Buy O
and O
it O
drew O
from O
my O
iTunes B-AS
account O
and O
sent O
the O
book O
to O
my O
house O
, O
the O
book O
was O
of O
perfect O
quality O
- O
exactly O
how O
I O
had O
created O
it O
and O
looked O
better O
than O
I O
had O
even O
imagined O
. O

I O
use O
this O
for O
my O
tutoring O
business O
, O
and O
since O
I O
' O
m O
always O
bouncing O
from O
student O
to O

, O
it O
is O
ideal O
for O

yes O
, O
it O
gets O
the O
8 O

advertised O
! O
. O

It O
is O
in O
the O
best O
condition O
and O
has O
a O
really O

When O
it O
come O

you O
do O
n't O
matter O

At O

those O

very O
very O
slow O

I O
' O
m O
going O
back O
to O

With O
what O
I O
paid O
for O
this O
computer O
it O
should O
have O
had O
everything O
on O
it O

Apple O

always O
great O
about O
the O

of O
things O

they O
always O
come O
up O
with O
good O

I O

looking O
for O
a O

Runs B-AS

and O
quick O

Not O
a O
bad O
laptop O
, O
it O
's O
a O
bit O
slow O
, O
but O
gets O
the O
job O

Honestly O
, O
I O
spent O
more O
time O
waiting O
for O
it O

unfreeze O

actually O
doing O
what O
I O
got O
on O
there O
for O

This O
a O

notebook O

No O
I O
am O
generous O
calling O
it O
slow O

The O
downside O
to O
this O
netbook O
is O
pretty O
much O
the O
same O
for O
any O
netbook O
, O
screen B-AS
size I-AS
is O
not O
something O

stare O

the O
entire O
10 O

11 O
hours O
of O

life I-AS
five O
days O

All O

definitely O
recommend O
this O

for O
nearly O
everyone O

in O
5 O
months O
the O

quality I-AS
got O
worse O
and O

The O
big O
screen B-AS
allows O
you O
to O
enjoy O
watching O
movies O
, O
pictures O
and O

the O
headphone B-AS

not O

I O
have O

at O
least O
eight O
Toshiba O
laptops O
, O
and O
they O
have O
been O
outstanding O
, O
including O
this O
one O
. O

I O
called O
back O
to O
ensure O
that O
received O
it O
, O
they O
had O
. O

the O
manufacturer O
's O
warranty B-AS
only O
covers O
replacement O
/ O
repair O

What O
I O
'd O
like O
is O
for O
the O
laptop O
to O
run B-AS
well O
without O
having O
to O
purchase O
additional O
memory B-AS
. O

If O
you O
can O
afford O
a O
new O
laptop O
, O
and O
are O
in O
the O
market O
for O
one O
, O
of O
course O
, O
then O
definitely O
go O
for O
this O
. O

Got O
the O
computer O
back O
a O
month O
later O
and O
it O
was O
still O
broken O
sent O
it O
out O
again O
and O
they O
repaired O
it O
. O

It O
works B-AS
exactly O
like O
it O
did O
the O
day O
I O
took O
it O
out O
of O
the O
box O
. O

Now O
, O
the O
next O
issue O
I O
had O
freaked O
me O
out O
. O

i O
love O
ths O
notebook O
. O

It O
is O
fast O
booting B-AS
up I-AS
, O
shutting B-AS
down I-AS
, O
and O
connection B-AS
with I-AS
the I-AS
internet I-AS
. O

The O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
is O
great O
. O

This O
is O
not O
a O
serious O
gaming B-AS
laptop O
or O
a O
serious O
media O
machine O
; O

Even O
if O
Apple O
replaces O
whatever O
needs O
replacing O
I O
wonder O
if O
, O
since O
I O
seem O
to O
be O
doubling O
the O
amount O
of O
time O
I O
get O
out O
of O
it O
each O
time O
it O
's O
like O
new O
, O
I O
might O
have O
8 O
months O
next O
time O
. O

I O
got O
this O
laptop O
on O
Black O
Friday O
. O

They O
replaced O
my O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
as O
well O
as O
my O
mother B-AS
board I-AS
. O

I O
fell O
in O
love O
with O
it O
. O

It O
was O
just O
one O
problem O
after O
another O
for O
me O
, O
and O
that O
's O
reason O
we O
had O
forked O
out O
so O
much O
money O
was O
so O
we O
would O
n't O
have O
anything O
to O
worry O
about O
. O

There O
is O
nothing O
to O
complain O
about O
the O
system B-AS
. O

and O
it O
comes O
with O
the O
new O
OSX B-AS
that O
comes O
with O
new O
features B-AS
that O
makes O
the O
use B-AS
more O
easy O
. O

Maybe O
not O
the O
cutting O
edge O
Satellite O
L455D O
but O
it O
is O
a O
workhorse O
. O

But O
the O
Macbook O
is O
the O
best O
! O

Now O
the O
screen B-AS
is O
going O
darker O
, O
darker O
, O
darker O

EITHER O

it O

still O
love O
to O

Features B-AS

This O

is O
the O

Both O

started O
acting O
extremely O
slow O
within O
the O
first O
year O
of O
owning O
them O

The O
MacBook O
Pro O
is O
very O
sturdy O
and O
versatile O

when O
i O
called O
to O
have O
another O
one O
shipped O
or O
to O
get O
my O
money O
back O
they O
said O
the O

is O
23 O
twenty O
three O

from O
the O

of O

BOUGHT O
FROM O
WAL O
- O
MART O
, O
I O
BELIEVE O
THAT O
THIS O
LAPTOP O
WAS O
A O
REPAIRED O
ITEM O
. O

Could O
nt O
not O
use O
it O
. O

I O
sent O
it O
back O
and O
found O
this O
time O
that O
the O
battery B-AS
was O
faulty O
, O
so O
I O
got O
a O
new O
one O
and O
some O
other O
fixes O
they O
found O
. O

I O
swear O
they O
design O
these O
things O
to O
go O
to O
crap O
after O
a O
year O
so O
you O
are O
stuck O
and O
have O
to O
buy O
a O
new O
one O
. O

Great O
pick O
for O

It O
's O
fast O
, O
it O
's O
easy O
easy O
easy O
to O
set B-AS
up I-AS
, O
easy O
to O
hook B-AS

I O
previously O
purchased O
a O
13 O
macbook O
had O
pro O
specs B-AS
and O
was O
aluminum B-AS
style I-AS
which O
had O
a O
nvidia B-AS
9800 I-AS
If O
I O
am O
not O
mistaken O
and O
it O
had O
major O
heating O
issues O
. O

They O
did O
n't O
even O
try O
to O
assist O
me O
or O
even O
offer O
a O
replacement O
. O

We O
used O
PC O
products O
, O
it O
seemed O
simpler O
to O
continue O
with O
the O
same O
thing O
. O

The O
people O
there O
just O
changed O
for O
me O
on O
the O
spot O
and O
I O
got O
a O
new O
arm B-AS

even O
request O

I O
love O
my O
Samsung O
TV O
and O
Galaxy O

smartphone O
, O
but O
this O
Netbook O
was O
a O
very O
poor O
computer O
. O

I O
made O
a O
perfect O
decision O
when O
I O
bought O
the O
Toshiba O
! O

I O
take O
it O
everywhere O
with O
me O
because O
it O
's O
so O
easy O
to O
carry B-AS
. O

The O
only O
thing O
is O
that O
the O
battery B-AS
wo O
n't O
last O
more O
than O
1/2 O
an O
hour O
. O

It O
still O
heats O
up O
like O
mad O
and O
I O
am O
unable O
to O
use O
it O
with O
the O
computer O
directly O
on O
my
