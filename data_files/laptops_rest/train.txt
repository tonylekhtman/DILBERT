I O
charge O
it O
at O
night O
and O
skip O
taking O
the O
cord B-AS
with O
me O
because O
of O
the O
good O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
. O

I O
bought O
a O
HP O
Pavilion O
DV4 O
- O
1222nr O
laptop O
and O
have O
had O
so O
many O
problems O
with O
the O
computer O
. O

The O
tech B-AS
guy I-AS
then O
said O
the O
service B-AS
center I-AS
does O
not O
do O
1-to-1 O
exchange O
and O
I O
have O
to O
direct O
my O
concern O
to O
the O
" B-AS
sales I-AS
" I-AS
team I-AS
, O
which O
is O
the O
retail O
shop O
which O
I O
bought O
my O
netbook O
from O
. O

I O
investigated O
netbooks O
and O
saw O
the O
Toshiba O
NB305-N410BL O
. O

The O
other O
day O
I O
had O
a O
presentation O
to O
do O
for O
a O
seminar O
at O
a O
large O
conference O
in O
town O
lots O
of O
people O
, O
little O
time O
to O
prep O
and O
have O
to O
set O
up O
a O
computer O
to O
a O
projector O
, O
etc O
. O

it O
is O
of O
high O
quality B-AS
, O
has O
a O
killer O
GUI B-AS
, O
is O
extremely O
stable O
, O
is O
highly O
expandable O
, O
is O
bundled O
with O
lots O
of O
very O
good O
applications B-AS
, O
is O
easy O
to O
use B-AS
, O
and O
is O
absolutely O
gorgeous O
. O

Easy O
to O
start B-AS
up I-AS
and O
does O
not O
overheat O
as O
much O
as O
other O
laptops O
. O

Sad O
very O
SAD O
. O

I O
even O
got O
my O
teenage O
son O
one O
, O
because O
of O
the O
features B-AS
that O
it O
offers O
, O
like O
, O
iChat B-AS
, O
Photobooth B-AS
, O
garage B-AS
band I-AS
and O
more O
! O

Needless O
to O
say O
a O
PC O
that O
ca O
n't O
support O
a O
cell O
phone O
is O
less O
than O
useless O
! O

Great O
laptop O
that O
offers O
many O
great O
features B-AS
! O

they O
have O
done O
absolutely O
nothing O
to O
fix O
the O
computer O
problem O
. O

One O
night O
I O
turned O
the O
freaking O
thing O
off O
after O
using O
it O
, O
the O
next O
day O
I O
turn O
it O
on O
, O
no O
GUI B-AS
, O
screen B-AS
all O
dark O
, O
power B-AS
light I-AS
steady O
, O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
light I-AS
steady O
and O
not O
flashing O
as O
it O
usually O
does O
. O

Still O
pretty O
pricey O
, O
but O
I O
' O
ve O
been O
putting O
off O
money O
for O
a O
while O
as O
a O
little O
Macbook O
Fund O
, O
and O
finally O
got O
to O
use O
it O
. O

I O
took O
it O
back O
for O
an O
Asus O
and O
same O
thing O
blue O
screen O
which O
required O
me O
to O
remove O
the O
battery B-AS
to O
reset O
. O

In O
the O
shop O
, O
these O
MacBooks O
are O
encased O
in O
a O
soft O
rubber B-AS
enclosure I-AS
, O
so O
you O
will O
never O
know O
about O
the O
razor O
edge B-AS
until O
you O
buy O
it O
, O
get O
it O
home O
, O
break O
the O
seal O
and O
use O
it O
very O
clever O
con O
. O

However O
, O
the O
multi B-AS
- I-AS
touch I-AS
gestures I-AS
and O
large O
tracking B-AS
area I-AS
make O
having O
an O
external B-AS
mouse I-AS
unnecessary O
unless O
you O
're O
gaming B-AS
. O

Plus O
it O
is O
small O
and O
reasonably O
light O
so O
I O
can O
take O
it O
with O
me O
to O
and O
from O
work O
. O

I O
HATE O
this O
one O
. O

They O
were O
totally O
unconcerned O
that O
the O
computer O
was O
not O
correctly O
repaired O
in O
the O
first O
place O
. O

Toshiba O
does O
not O
send O
any O
one O
out O
unless O
you O
have O
paid O
extra O
to O
have O
the O
on O
site O
repair O
done O
. O

Oh O
, O
boy O
! O

But O
while O
this O
is O
one O
big O
advantage O
as O
you O
may O
know O
from O
the O
company O
s O
recent O
commercials O
there O
are O
other O
things O
to O
consider O
before O
going O
with O
Apple O
. O

I O
love O
the O
way O
the O
entire O
suite B-AS
of I-AS
software I-AS
works O
together O
. O

The O
speed B-AS
is O
incredible O
and O
I O
am O
more O
than O
satisfied O
. O

on O
the O
bright O
side O
at O
least O
I O
was O
n't O
without O
my O
laptop O
for O
long O
this O
time O
! O

This O
laptop O
meets O
every O
expectation O
and O
Windows B-AS
7 I-AS
is O
great O
! O

That O
's O
how O
frustrating O
it O
was O
. O

I O
can O
barely O
use O
any O
usb B-AS
devices I-AS
because O
they O
will O
not O
stay O
connected O
properly O
. O

The O
one O
down O
side O
to O
it O
is O
that O
when O
I O
play O
a O
certin O
game O
on O
here O
, O
it O
tends O
to O
freeze O
up O
sometimes O
, O
but O
that O
s O
the O
only O
bad O
thing O
about O
this O
computer O
. O

-No O
backlit O
keyboard O
, O
but O
not O
an O
issue O
for O
me O
. O

When O
I O
finally O
had O
everything O
running O
with O
all O
my O
software B-AS
installed O
I O
plugged O
in O
my O
droid O
to O
recharge O
and O
the O
system B-AS
crashed O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
even O
turn O
it O
off O
. O

One O
suggestion O
I O
do O
have O
, O
is O
to O
not O
bother O
getting O
Microsoft B-AS
office I-AS
for I-AS
the I-AS
mac I-AS
expecting O
it O
will O
work O
just O
like O
you O
knew O
it O
to O
on O
a O
PC O
. O

Pairing O
it O
with O
an O
iPhone O
is O
a O
pure O
pleasure O
, O
talk O
about O
painless O
syncing B-AS
, O
used O
to O
take O
me O
forever O
, O
now O
it O
's O
a O
snap O
. O

I O
shopped O
around O
before O
buying O
. O

I O
also O
got O
the O
added O
bonus O
of O
a O
30 B-AS
" I-AS
HD I-AS
Monitor I-AS
, O
which O
really O
helps O
to O
extend O
my O
screen B-AS
and O
keep O
my O
eyes O
fresh O
! O

Would O
do O
business O
again O
. O

The O
machine O
is O
slow O
to O
boot B-AS
up I-AS
and O
occasionally O
crashes O
completely O
. O

After O
paying O
several O
hundred O
dollars O
for O
this O
service B-AS
, O
it O
is O
frustrating O
that O
you O
can O
not O
get O
help O
after O
hours O
. O

I O
have O
had O
the O
luxury O
sarcasm O
of O
owning O
2 O
of O
these O
laptops O
. O

What O
a O
waste O
. O

It O
was O
a O
total O
Dhell O
experience O
that O
I O
will O
never O
repeat O
. O

There O
are O
a O
few O
flaws O
as O
well O
that O
I O
noticed O
. O

Completely O
worth O
every O
single O
penny O
dime O
and O
nickel O
. O

I O
tried O
to O
upgrade O
it O
to O
a O
newer O
version O
a O
couple O
of O
months O
ago O
and O
I O
still O
have O
the O
same O
problem O
. O

I O
did O
have O
to O
replace O
the O
battery O
once O
, O
but O
that O
was O
only O
a O
couple O
months O
ago O
and O
it O
's O
been O
working O
perfect O
ever O
since O
. O

, O
In O
the O
past O
four O
years O
I O
' O
ve O
had O
it O
I O
have O
never O
once O
gotten O
a O
virus O
. O

I O
love O
the O
operating B-AS
system I-AS
and O
the O
preloaded B-AS
software I-AS
. O

They O
were O
great O
in O
handling O
this O
problem O
, O
and O
I O
' O
m O
looking O
forward O
in O
purchasing O
additonal O
products O
from O
them O
in O
the O
future O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
tried O
going O
back O
to O
XL O
but O
there O
still O
problems O
. O

The O
best O
thing O
about O
this O
laptop O
is O
the O
price B-AS
along O
with O
some O
of O
the O
newer O
features B-AS
. O

After O
numerous O
attempts O
of O
trying O
including O
setting O
the O
clock B-AS
in I-AS
BIOS I-AS
setup I-AS
directly O
, O
I O
gave O
upI O
am O
a O
techie O
. O

YOU O
WILL O
NOT O
BE O
ABLE O
TO O
TALK O
TO O
AN O
AMERICAN O
WARRANTY B-AS
SERVICE I-AS
IS O
OUT O
OF O
COUNTRY O
. O

But O
it O
may O
be O
potentially O
hundreds O
or O
thousands O
in O
the O
near O
future O
. O

Has O
met O
or O
exceeded O
my O
needs O
for O
a O
compact O
travel O
device O
. O

but O
now O
i O
have O
realized O
its O
a O
problem O
with O
this O
brand B-AS
. O

It O
can O
not O
save O
the O
correct O
date O
and O
time O
I O
set O
. O

I O
sent O
it O
back O
to O
Toshiba O
twice O
they O
covered O
it O
under O
the O
warranty B-AS
. O

And O
this O
is O
n't O
just O
my O
one O
experine O
. O

They O
sent O
me O
a O
replacement O
part O
and O
without O
informing O
me O
are O
requiring O
that O
I O
return O
it O
within O
15 O
days O
or O
contact O
them O
and O
let O
them O
know O
the O
broken O
part O
will O
be O
returned O
later O
. O

I O
was O
looking O
for O
a O
mac O
which O
is O
portable O
and O
has O
all O
the O
features B-AS
that O
I O
was O
looking O
for O
. O

I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
this O
one O
to O
my O
friends O

I O
honestly O
love O
my O
mac O
, O
that O
s O
why O
I O
am O
a O
self O
proclaimed O
mac O
addict O
. O

And O
these O
are O
some O
reasons O
you O
should O
get O
a O
macbook O
pro O
. O

Also O
kinda O
loud O
when O
the O
fan B-AS
was O
running O
. O

In O
desparation O
, O
I O
called O
their O
Customer B-AS
Service I-AS
number I-AS
and O
was O
told O
that O
my O
warranty B-AS
had O
expired O
2 O
days O
old O
and O
that O
the O
priviledge O
of O
talking B-AS
to I-AS
a I-AS
technician I-AS
would O
cost O
me O
have O
your O
credit O
card O
ready O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
laptop O
while O
on O
a O
business O
trip O
to O
keep O
up O
with O
my O
email O
. O

There O
also O
seemed O
to O
be O
a O
problem O
with O
the O
hard B-AS
disc I-AS
as O
certain O
times O
windows B-AS
loads O
but O
claims O
to O
not O
be O
able O
to O
find O
any O
drivers B-AS
or O
files O
. O

Drivers B-AS
updated O
ok O
but O
the O
BIOS B-AS
update I-AS
froze O
the O
system B-AS
up O
and O
the O
computer O
shut O
down O
. O

-they O
lost O
my O
laptop O
for O
a O
month O

Spent O
2 O
hours O
on O
phone O
with O
HP B-AS
Technical I-AS
Support I-AS
. O

This O
is O
my O
second O
laptop O
, O
and O
it O
is O
head O
and O
shoulders O
above O
my O
first O
. O

at O
first O
! O

Speaking O
of O
the O
browser B-AS
, O
it O
too O
has O
problems O
. O

I O
think O
just O
going O
from O
PC O
to O
Mac O
has O
gotten O
me O
totally O
spoiled O
and O
I O
ca O
n't O
imagine O
ever O
going O
back O
. O

The O
keyboard B-AS
is O
too O
slick O
. O

Nightly O
my O
computer O
defrags O
itself O
and O
runs O
a O
virus B-AS
scan I-AS
. O

It O
's O
like O
9 B-AS
punds I-AS
, O
but O
if O
you O
can O
look O
past O
it O
, O
it O
's O
GREAT O
! O

It O
's O
just O
as O
fast O
with O
one O
program B-AS
open O
as O
it O
is O
with O
sixteen O
open O
. O

Still O
under O
warrenty B-AS
so O
called O
Toshiba O
, O
no O
help O
at O
all O
. O

I O
was O
happy O
with O
My O
purchase O
of O
a O
Toshiba O
Satellite O
L305D O
- O
S5934 O
laptop O
until O
it O
came O
time O
to O
have O
it O
repaired O
under O
the O
Toshiba B-AS
Warranty I-AS
. O

I O
LOVE O
IT O
! O

Amazing O
Quality B-AS
! O

The O
fact O
that O
you O
can O
spend O
over O
$ O
100 O
on O
just O
a O
webcam B-AS
underscores O
the O
value B-AS
of O
this O
machine O
. O

I O
mainly O
use O
it O
for O
email O
, O
internet B-AS
, O
and O
managing B-AS
personal I-AS
files I-AS
pics O
, O
vids O
, O
etc O
. O

A O
month O
or O
so O
ago O
, O
the O
freaking O
motherboard B-AS
just O
died O
. O

The O
system B-AS
it O
comes O
with O
does O
not O
work O
properly O
, O
so O
when O
trying O
to O
fix O
the O
problems O
with O
it O
it O
started O
not O
working O
at O
all O
. O

Then O
after O
4 O
or O
so O
months O
the O
charger B-AS
stopped O
working O
so O
I O
was O
forced O
to O
go O
out O
and O
buy O
new O
hardware B-AS
just O
to O
keep O
this O
computer O
running O
. O

I O
took O
it O
back O
to O
Best O
Buy O
where O
they O
were O
so O
helpful O
and O
immediately O
gave O
me O
a O
new O
one O
. O

If O
you O
had O
PC O
for O
four O
years O
I O
can O
almost O
gaurentee O
that O
something O
would O
of O
gone O
wrong O
by O
now O
, O
maybe O
even O
forcing O
you O
to O
replace O
your O
entire O
computer O
. O

* O
2 O
weeks O
after O
giving O
the O
computer O
for O
repair*-Called O
headquarters O
, O
they O
report O
that O
they O
have O
not O
looked O
at O
it O
yet O
but O
it O
is O
on O
the O
top O
of O
the O
stack O
. O

This O
machine O
delivers O
. O

Then O
2 O
of O
my O
nephews O
were O
going O
into O
music O
and O
both O
fell O
in O
love O
with O
the O
MacBook O
Pro O
. O

I O
complain O
again O
. O

This O
laptop O
is O
insane O
! O
! O
! O

If O
a O
website O
ever O
freezes O
which O
is O
rare O
, O
its O
really O
easy O
to O
force B-AS
quit I-AS
. O

It O
does O
run O
a O
little O
warm O
but O
that O
is O
a O
negligible O
concern O
. O

It O
rarely O
works B-AS
and O
when O
it O
does O
it O
's O
incredibly O
slow O
. O

I O
also O
enjoy O
the O
fact O
that O
my O
MacBook O
Pro O
laptop O
allows O
me O
to O
run O
Windows B-AS
7 I-AS
on O
it O
by O
using O
the O
VMWare B-AS
program I-AS
. O

It O
's O
so O
much O
easier O
to O
navigate B-AS
through O
the O
operating B-AS
system I-AS
, O
to O
find B-AS
files I-AS
, O
and O
it O
runs B-AS
a O
lot O
faster O
! O

Purchased O
a O
Toshiba O
Lap O
top O
it O
worked O
good O
until O
just O
after O
the O
warrenty B-AS
went O
out O
. O

I O
always O
swore O
by O
PCs O
and O
would O
never O
consider O
a O
MAC O
. O

what O
an O
elegant O
, O
wonderful O
machine O
. O

This O
is O
now O
my O
3rd O
MacBook O
Pro O
and O
I O
really O
honestly O
love O
it O
! O

for O
2 O
months O
. O

I O
wanted O
to O
purchase O
the O
extended B-AS
warranty I-AS
and O
they O
refused O
, O
because O
they O
knew O
it O
was O
trouble O
. O

Do O
you O
ever O
think O
HP O
would O
do O
that O
? O
NEVER O
! O

We O
upgraded O
the O
memory B-AS
to O
four O
gigabytes O
in O
order O
to O
take O
advantage O
of O
the O
performace B-AS
increase O
in O
speed B-AS
. O

It O
's O
not O
like O
I O
have O
used O
for O
half O
a O
year O
and O
then O
complained O
about O
it O
. O

Still O
trying O
to O
learn O
how O
to O
use O
it O
. O

The O
reality O
was O
, O
it O
heated O
up O
very O
quickly O
, O
and O
took O
way O
too O
long O
to O
do O
simple O
things O
, O
like O
opening B-AS
my I-AS
Documents I-AS
folder I-AS
. O

I O
bought O
the O
netbook O
because O
it O
was O
smaller O
and O
lighter O
for O
me O
to O
carry O
around O
. O

The O
Genius O
at O
the O
Apple O
store O
advised O
me O
that O
there O
was O
nothing O
about O
my O
use O
of O
the O
computer O
that O
caused O
this O
failure O
. O

We O
'll O
save O
our O
money O
to O
replace O
it O
with O
a O
Mac O
again O
! O

Thank O
you O
for O
your O
great O
product O
! O

this O
company O
truely O
does O
make O
horrible O
products O
and O
does O
nt O
seem O
to O
because O
they O
are O
certain O
things O
like O
this O
never O
happen O
. O

I O
had O
always O
used O
PCs O
and O
been O
constantly O
frustrated O
by O
the O
crashing O
and O
the O
poorly O
designed O
operating B-AS
systems I-AS
that O
were O
never O
very O
intuitive O
. O

Sorry O
Toshiba O
, O
but O
1st O
impressions O
do O
count O
for O
something O
. O

Then O
, O
within O
5 O
months O
, O
the O
charger B-AS
crapped O
out O
on O
me O
. O

And O
if O
you O
have O
a O
iphone O
or O
ipod O
touch O
you O
can O
connect O
and O
download O
songs O
to O
it O
at O
high O
speed B-AS
. O

Overall O
this O
laptop O
is O
great O
. O

I O
love O
the O
glass B-AS
touchpad I-AS
. O

I O
continued O
to O
take O
the O
computer O
in O
AGAIN O
and O
they O
replaced O
the O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
and O
mother B-AS
board I-AS
yet O
again O
. O

I O
am O
using O
the O
external B-AS
speaker I-AS
sound I-AS
is O
good O
. O

The O
Apple O
MC371LL O
/ O
A O
24Ghz O
154-inch O
MacBook O
Pro O
Notebook O
is O
a O
horrible O
waste O
of O
money O
. O

Ok O
, O
this O
is O
probably O
the O
best O
laptop O
series O
ever O
devised O
by O
Apple O
. O

As O
of O
a O
couple O
weeks O
ago O
the O
middle O
portion O
of O
the O
laptop O
from O
top O
to O
bottom O
, O
, O
, O
about O
4 O
inches O
across O
is O
hardly O
visible O
. O

still O
testing O
the O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
as O
i O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
better O
, O
but O
am O
very O
happy O
with O
the O
upgrade O
. O

Then O
HP O
sends O
it O
back O
to O
me O
with O
the O
hardware B-AS
screwed O
up O
, O
not O
able O
to O
connect O
. O

I O
just O
hope O
the O
reputation O
that O
Toshiba O
has O
is O
true O
and O
I O
wo O
n't O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
a O
crash O
. O

Oh O
yeah O
, O
do O
n't O
forget O
the O
expensive O
shipping B-AS
to O
and O
from O
HP O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
anyone O
to O
buy O
from O
pcconnection O
express O
. O

Good O
luck O
. O

Everything O
is O
so O
easy O
to O
use B-AS
, O
Mac B-AS
software I-AS
is O
just O
so O
much O
simpler O
than O
Microsoft B-AS
software I-AS
. O

My O
favorite O
by O
far O
, O
although O
the O
most O
expensive O
, O
was O
my O
Sony O
. O

And O
if O
you O
do O
a O
lot O
of O
writing O
, O
editing B-AS
is O
a O
problem O
since O
there O
is O
no O
forward O
delete B-AS
key I-AS
. O

Also O
I O
typed O
faster O
then O
then O
letters O
would O
show O
and O
it O
got O
to O
be O
realy O
annoying O
. O

As O
an O
owner O
of O
a O
Toshiba O
Satalite O
laptop O
computer O
things O
you O
should O
know O
before O
you O
buy O
. O

Its O
ease O
of O
use B-AS
and O
the O
top O
service B-AS
from O
Apple O
be O
it O
their O
phone B-AS
assistance I-AS
or O
bellying O
up O
to O
the O
genius B-AS
bar I-AS
can O
not O
be O
beat O
. O

It O
has O
a O
10 O
hour O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
when O
you O
're O
doing O
web B-AS
browsing I-AS
and O
word B-AS
editing I-AS
, O
making O
it O
perfect O
for O
the O
classroom O
or O
office O
, O
and O
in O
terms O
of O
gaming B-AS
and O
movie B-AS
playing I-AS
it O
'll O
have O
a O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
of O
just O
over O
5 O
hours O
. O

I O
shipped O
out O
on O
Saturday O
, O
July O
17 O
. O

I O
bought O
it O
for O
really O
cheap O
also O
and O
it O
's O
AMAZING O
. O

Acer O
has O
set O
me O
up O
with O
FREE O
recovery B-AS
discs I-AS
, O
when O
they O
are O
available O
since O
I O
asked O
. O

I O
also O
purchased O
Office B-AS
Max I-AS
's I-AS
" I-AS
Max I-AS
Assurance I-AS
" I-AS
with O
the O
no O
lemon O
clause O

If O
you O
find O
yourself O
in O
the O
market O
for O
a O
new O
laptop O
and O
have O
the O
money O
do O
n't O
exclude O
looking O
at O
the O
MBPs O
. O

I O
eventually O
did O
the O
migration O
from O
my O
iMac B-AS
backup I-AS
disc I-AS
which O
uses O
USB B-AS
. O

Those O
things O
are O
very O
important O
, O
vital O
even O
! O

-They O
say O
it O
will O
take O
up O
to O
two O
weeks O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
like O
one O
thing O
about O
it O
. O

The O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
seems O
to O
be O
very O
good O
, O
and O
have O
had O
no O
issues O
with O
it O
. O

Enabling O
the O
battery B-AS
timer I-AS
is O
useless O
. O

Temperatures B-AS
on O
the O
outside O
were O
alright O
but O
i O
did O
not O
track O
in O
Core B-AS
Processing I-AS
Unit I-AS

. O

Yeah O
, O
to O
you O
. O

I O
got O
a O
mac O
as O
my O
HS O
graduation O
gift O
. O

I O
have O
now O
had O
it O
for O
15 O
months O
and O
love O
it O
. O

It O
turned O
out O
it O
's O
not O
really O
a O
problem O
to O
have O
a O
Mac O
. O

Page O
just O
disapeared O
after O
you O
got O
yahoo O
or O
downloaded O
something O
. O

Images O
can O
be O
multi O
- O
selected O
and O
viewed O
swiftly O
or O
in O
slideshow O
mode O
. O

Going O
to O
bring O
it O
to O
service B-AS
today O
. O

There O
is O
no O
need O
to O
purchase O
virus B-AS
protection I-AS
for I-AS
Mac I-AS
, O
which O
saves O
me O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
and O
money O
. O

But O
we O
had O
paid O
for O
bluetooth B-AS
, O
and O
there O
was O
none O
. O

So O
, O
I O
paid O
a O
visit O
to O
LG B-AS
notebook I-AS
service I-AS
center I-AS
at O
Alexandra O
Road O
, O
hoping O
they O
can O
make O
the O
hinge B-AS
tighter O
. O

My O
daughter O
uses O
it O
for O
games B-AS
, O
email O
, O
facebook O
, O
pictures O
and O
music O
. O

Laptop O
is O
to O
be O
used O
like O
a O
Netbook O
. O

It O
is O
always O
reliable O
, O
never O
bugged O
and O
responds B-AS
well O
. O

After O
about O
a O
week O
I O
finally O
got O
it O
back O
and O
was O
told O
that O
the O
motherboard B-AS
had O
failed O
and O
so O
they O
installed O
a O
new O
motherboard B-AS
. O

Trying O
to O
balance O
all O
of O
my O
roles O
leaves O
very O
little O
time O
for O
me O
to O
do O
anything O
, O
so O
I O
want O
to O
manage O
my O
time O
I O
do O
have O
to O
be O
the O
most O
efficient O
. O

It O
was O
slow O
, O
locked O
up O
, O
and O
also O
had O
hardware B-AS
replaced O
after O
only O
2 O
months O
! O

they O
had O
to O
replace O
the O
motherboard B-AS
in O
April O

Yes O
, O
the O
computer O
was O
light O
weight O
, O
less O
expensive O
than O
the O
average O
laptop O
, O
and O
was O
pretty O
self O
explantory O
in O
use B-AS
. O

Also O
, O
if O
you O
need O
to O
talk O
to O
a O
representive B-AS
at I-AS
Microsoft I-AS
, O
there O
is O
a O
charge O
, O
which O
I O
believe O
is O
robbery O
, O
since O
you O
are O
charged O
enormous O
amounts O
for O
a O
very O
badly O
designed O
system B-AS
, O
which O
most O
people O
would O
have O
went O
with O
XP B-AS
if O
they O
could O
. O

There O
is O
a O
little O
indent O
to O
help O
open O
it O
, O
but O
good O
luck O
with O
that O
. O

I O
love O
WIndows B-AS
7 I-AS
which O
is O
a O
vast O
improvment O
over O
Vista B-AS
. O

Also O
, O
I O
have O
alot O
of O
trouble O
with O
it O
getting O
very O
hot O
, O
and O
not O
even O
sitting O
on O
anything O
to O
make O
it O
hot O
. O

It O
Was O
a O
great O
deal O
after O
all O
. O

This O
mac O
is O
great O
! O

Keyboard B-AS
is O
great O
, O
very O
quiet O
for O
all O
the O
typing O
that O
I O
do O
. O

I O
grew O
up O
in O
a O
design O
family O
so O
it O
only O
made O
sense O
. O

Gave O
phonenumber O
. O

It O
would O
take O
up O
too O
much O
time O
to O
do O
reaearch O
for O
my O
papers O
and O
I O
would O
be O
up O
hours O
- O
just O
because O
the O
computer O
was O
too O
slow O
. O

Oh O
my O
goodness O
- O
I O
am O
not O
a O
happy O
camper O
. O

Dell B-AS
's I-AS

is O
an O
insult O
to O
it O
's O
customers O
who O
pay O
good O
money O
for O
shoddy O
products O
. O

I O
'd O
recommend O
this O
laptop O
to O
anyone O
! O

Yet O
, O
HP O
wo O
n't O
do O
anything O
about O
the O
problem O
. O

i O
' O
m O
returning O
mine O

It O
had O
a O
cooling B-AS
system I-AS
malfunction O
after O
10 O
minutes O
of O
general O
use B-AS
, O
and O
would O
not O
move O
past O
this O
error O
. O

I O
can O
render O
AVCHD O
movies O
with O
little O
effort O
, O
which O
was O
a O
problem O
for O
most O
pc O
's O
unless O
you O
had O
a O
quad B-AS
core I-AS
I7 I-AS
. O

It O
's O
a O
bummer O
and O
one O
out O
of O
five O
is O
being O
kind O
. O

This O
is O
what O
they O
told O
me O
, O
It O
heats O
up O
, O
and O
that O
is O
the O
reason O
we O
no O
longer O
call O
them O
laptops O
, O
and O
simply O
categorize O
them O
as O
portables O
. O

After O
talking O
it O
over O
with O
the O
very O
knowledgeable O
sales B-AS
associate I-AS
, O
I O
chose O
the O
MacBook O
Pro O
over O
the O
white O
MacBook O
. O

If O
you O
really O
want O
a O
bang O
- O
up O
system B-AS
and O
do O
n't O
need O
to O
run O
Windows B-AS
applications I-AS
, O
go O
with O
an O
Apple O
; O

You O
wo O
n't O
have O
to O
spend O
gobs O
of O
money O
on O
some O
inefficient O
virus B-AS
program I-AS
that O
needs O
to O
be O
updated O
every O
month O
and O
that O
constantly O
drains O
your O
wallet O
. O

This O
laptop O
is O
fast O
and O
you O
will O
literally O
learn O
all O
you O
can O
do O
with O
this O
dynamo O
by O
just O
watching O
the O
online O
tutorials O
. O

One O
of O
them O
seems O
to O
have O
worked O
. O

Which O
I O
still O
use O
and O
have O
hooked O
up O
to O
my O
TV O
. O

The O
problem O
I O
had O
with O
this O
unit O
was O
unresolvable O
. O

It O
weighed B-AS
like O
seven B-AS
pounds I-AS
or O
something O
like O
that O
. O

2 O
months O
later O
, O
the O
battery B-AS
went O
. O

You O
may O
need O
to O
special O
order O
a O
bag B-AS
. O

It O
's O
color B-AS
is O
even O
cool O
. O

and O
it O
has O
blue O
screen O
crashed O
on O
me O
twice O
. O

Another O
two O
weeks O
later O
and O
it O
was O
back O
in O
my O
possession O
. O

keys B-AS
are O
all O
in O
weird O
places O
and O
is O
way O
too O
large O
for O
the O
way O
it O
is O
designed B-AS
. O

I O
' O
ve O
owned O
every O
Pro O
model O
Apple O
laptop O
for O
the O
last O
8 O
years O
, O
this O
is O
BY O
FAR O
the O
WORST O
one O
I O
' O
ve O
ever O
had O
. O

We O
purchase O
the O
Dell O
XPS O
several O
years O
ago O
for O
my O
home O
business O
. O

Have O
purchased O
many O
products O
over O
the O
years O
from O
MacConnection O
and O
this O
transaction O
, O
like O
all O
the O
others O
, O
we O
smoothly O
with O
no O
problems O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
anyone O
to O
buy O
from O

. O

Yes O
, O
a O
Mac O
is O
much O
more O
money O
than O
the O
average O
laptop O
out O
there O
, O
but O
there O
is O
no O
comparison O
in O
style B-AS
, O
speed B-AS
and O
just O
cool O
factor O
. O

He O
gave O
me O
this O
PC O
about O
3 O
years O
ago O
and O
up O
to O
this O
point O
i O
m O
still O
sitting O
here O
using O
it O

I O
' O
m O
pleased O
. O

The O
keyboard B-AS
feels O
good O
and O
I O
type O
just O
fine O
on O
it O
. O

With O
a O
healthy O
pessimism O
, O
I O
took O
the O
machine O
home O
and O
tried O
to O
find O
a O
flaw O
. O

Shiny O
This O
Laptop O
is O
the O
Best O
of O
the O
best O
! O

I O
thought O
the O
white O
Mac O

looked O
dirty O
too O
quicly O
where O
you O
use O
the O
mousepad B-AS
and O
where O
you O
place O
your O
hands O
when O
typing O
. O

And O
not O
to O
mention O
after O
using O
it O
for O
a O
few O
months O
or O
so O
, O
the O
battery B-AS
will O
slowly O
less O
and O
less O
hold O
a O
charge O
until O
you O
ca O
n't O
leave O
it O
unplugged O
for O
more O
than O
5 O
minutes O
without O
the O
thing O
dying O
. O

Do O
n't O
waste O
their O
money O
, O
save O
it O
and O
but O
a O
mac O
. O

Money O
and O
time O
well O
spent O
! O

Gradually O
the O
freezing O
screen O
evolved O
into O
a O
screen O
that O
froze O
in O
weird O
shapes O

I O

I O

I O
have O
this O
model O
Toshiba O

no O
complaints O
with O
their O

and O
maybe O
because O
it O
just O
sits O
on O
your O
desktop O

and O
you O
do O
n't O
carry O
it O
around O

which O
could O
jar O
the O
hard B-AS

or O
the O

Yes O
, O
they O
cost O
more O

they O
more O
than O
make O
up O
for O
it O
in O

and O

Since O
I O
keyboard B-AS
over O
100 O
wpm O
, O
I O
look O
for O
a O
unit O
that O
has O
a O

no O

I O
also O
tried O
the O
touch B-AS
pad I-AS
and O
compared O
it O
to O
other O
netbooks O
in O
the O
store O
. O

It O
absolutely O
is O
more O
expensive O
than O
most O
PC O

, O
but O
the O
ease O
of O
use B-AS
, O
security B-AS
, O
and O
minimal O
problems O
that O
have O
arisen O
make O
it O
well O
worth O
the O

It O
gets O
stuck O
all O
of O
the O
time O
you O
use B-AS
it O

you O

! O

Have O
returned O
that O
laptop O
unused O
. O

Will O
probably O
never O
buy O
a O
HP O
again O
. O

I O
got O
tired O
of O
buying O
laptops O
and O
having O
them O
stop O
working O
after O
a O
year O
. O

I O
should O
have O
been O
more O
observant O
. O

I O
wish O
it O
had O
a O
webcam B-AS
though O
, O
then O
it O
would O
be O
perfect O
! O

My O
favorite O
part O
of O
this O
computer O
is O
that O
it O
has O
a O
vga B-AS
port I-AS
so O
I O
can O
connect O
it O
to O
a O
bigger O
screen B-AS
. O

Another O
thing O
I O
might O
add O
is O
the O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
is O
excellent O
. O

One O
drawback O
, O
I O
wish O
the O
keys B-AS
were O
backlit O
. O

When O
the O
buyer O
returned O
it O
Wal O
Mart O
just O
boxed O
it O
, O
taped O
it O
shut O
resold O
it O
as O
new O
. O

What O
a O
great O
little O
laptop O
. O

Acer O
was O
no O
help O
and O
Garmin O
could O
not O
determine O
the O
problemafter O
spending O
about O
2 O
hours O
with O
me O
, O
so O
I O
returned O
it O
and O
purchased O
a O
Toshiba O
R700 O
that O
seems O
even O
nicer O
and O
I O
was O
able O
to O
load O
all O
of O
my O
software B-AS
with O
no O
problem O
. O

I O
wish O
the O
volume B-AS
could O
be O
louder O
and O
the O
mouse B-AS
did O
n't O
break O
after O
only O
a O
month O
. O

I O
play O
a O
lot O
of O
casual O
games O
online O
, O
and O
the O
touchpad B-AS
is O
very O
responsive O
. O

Granted O
, O
it O
's O
still O
a O
very O
new O
laptop O
but O
in O
comparison O
to O
my O
previous O
laptops O
and O
desktops O
, O
my O
Mac O
boots B-AS
up I-AS
noticeably O
quicker O
. O

It O
caught O
a O
virus O
that O
completely O
wiped O
out O
my O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
in O
a O
matter O
of O
hours O
. O

WOULD O
PAY O
MORE O
FOR O
IT O
IF O
I O
HAD O
TOO O
! O

Could O
n't O
keep O
a O
page O
up O
you O
were O
working O
on O
! O

It O
is O
everything O
I O
'd O
hoped O
it O
would O
be O
from O
a O
look B-AS
and I-AS
feel I-AS
standpoint I-AS
, O
but O
somehow O
a O
bit O
more O
sturdy O
. O

the O
only O
fact O
i O
do O
n't O
like O
about O
apples O
is O
they O
generally O
use O
safari B-AS
and O
i O
do O
n't O
use O
safari B-AS
but O
after O
i O
install O
Mozzilla B-AS
firfox I-AS
i O
love O
every O
single O
bit O
about O
it O
. O

The O
Bluetooth B-AS
was O
not O
there O
at O
all O
, O
and O
the O
fingerprint B-AS
reader I-AS
driver I-AS
would O
be O
there O
, O
but O
the O
software B-AS
would O
hang O
after O
installation O
was O
1/2 O
way O
done O
. O

Great O
battery B-AS
, O
speed B-AS
, O
display B-AS
. O

I O
would O
not O
recommend O
this O
product O
to O
anyone O
. O

I O
like O
to O
use O
it O
at O
the O
race O
track O
to O
handiecap O
the O
horse O
races O
. O

I O
was O
given O
a O
Mac O
as O
a O
birthday O
present O
and O
could O
n't O
be O
happier O
with O
it O
3 O
years O
later O
. O

The O
delivery B-AS
was O
fast O
, O
and O
I O
would O
not O
hesitate O
to O
purchase O
this O
laptop O
again O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
been O
impressed O
with O
the O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
and O
the O
performance B-AS
for O
such O
a O
small O
amount O
of O
memory B-AS
. O

do O
a O
quick O
search O
on O
the O
internet O
see O
if O
i O
m O
the O
only O
one O
. O

I O
' O
m O
extremely O
happy O
with O
my O
purchase O
as O
I O
now O
have O
the O
portable O
power O
I O
have O
been O
looking O
for O
. O

It O
's O
applications B-AS
are O
terrific O
, O
including O
the O
replacements O
for O
Microsoft B-AS
office I-AS
. O

they O
improved O
nothing O
else O
such O
as O
Resolution B-AS
, O
appearance B-AS
, O
cooling B-AS
system I-AS
, O
graphics B-AS
card I-AS
, O
etc O
. O

I O
got O
it O
back O
and O
my O
built B-AS
- I-AS
in I-AS
webcam I-AS
and O
built B-AS
- I-AS
in I-AS
mic I-AS
were O
shorting O
out O
anytime O
I O
touched O
the O
lid O
, O
mind O
you O
this O
was O
my O
means O
of O
communication O
with O
my O
fiance O
who O
was O
deployed O
but O
I O
suffered O
thru O
it O
and O
would O
constandly O
have O
to O
reset O
the O
computer O
to O
be O
able O
to O
use O
my O
cam B-AS
and O
mic B-AS
anytime O
they O
went O
out O
. O

Is O
this O
partially O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
is O
running O
Windows B-AS
Vista I-AS
? O

You O
might O
think O
, O
I O
am O
new O
in O
this O
game O
, O
but O
I O
am O
a O
gadget O
lover O
, O
and O
have O
had O
more O
than O
2 O
dozens O
laptops O
in O
the O
past O
15 O
years O
, O
and O
none O
gets O
this O
hot O
, O
that O
fast O
. O

I O
was O
informed O
that O
I O
need O
to O
call O
some O
0900 O
number O
first O
. O

I O
really O
wanted O
a O
Mac O
over O
a O
pc O
because O
I O
used O
a O
Mac O
in O
high O
school O
. O

1 O
Payed O
$ O
2200 O
for O
a O
premium O
laptop O

I O
BOUGHT O
THEM O
FOR O
MY O
COLLEGE O
AGE O
GRANDCHILDREN O
AND O
THESE O
MACS O
ARE O
TOTALLY O
RELIABLE O
AND O
SUPPORT O
THEIR O
CLASS O
WORK O
100 O
% O
OF O
THE O
TIME O
. O

The O
board B-AS
has O
a O
bad O
connector B-AS
with O
the O
power B-AS
supply I-AS
and O
shortly O
after O
warrenty B-AS
expires O
the O
power B-AS
supply I-AS
will O
start O
having O
issues O
. O

Do O
not O
purchase O
this O
laptop O
. O

My O
dad O
has O
one O
of O
the O
very O
first O
Toshibas O
ever O
made O
, O
yes O
its O
abit O
slow O
now O
but O
still O
works B-AS
well O
and O
i O
hooked O
to O
my O
ethernet B-AS
! O

Mostly O
I O
love O
the O
drag B-AS
and I-AS
drop I-AS
feature I-AS
. O

oh O
yeah O
, O
and O
if O
the O
fancy O
webcam B-AS
breaks O
guess O
who O
you O
have O
to O
send O
it O
to O
to O
get O
it O
fixed O
? O

She O
brought O
out O
2 O
other O
identical O
netbooks O
and O
still O
insist O
that O
It O
is O
like O
that O
one O
. O

I O
ordered O
through O
MacMall O
, O
which O
saved O
me O
the O
sales B-AS
tax I-AS
I O
would O
have O
incurred O
buying O
locally O
. O

Very O
fast O
and O
efficient O
! O

Of O
course O
, O
I O
also O
have O
several O
great O
software B-AS
packages I-AS
that O
came O
for O
free O
including O
iWork B-AS
, O
GarageBand B-AS
, O
and O
iMovie B-AS
. O

Being O
virus O
- O
resistant O
is O
a O
huge O
plus O
. O

The O
screen B-AS
is O
very O
large O
and O
crystal O
clear O
with O
amazing O
colors B-AS
and O
resolution B-AS
. O

After O
a O
little O
more O
than O
a O
year O
of O
owning O
my O
MacBook O
Pro O
, O
the O
monitor B-AS
has O
completely O
died O
. O

In O
my O
house O
, O
HP O
is O
a O
nasty O
word O
. O

The O
brand O
of O
iTunes B-AS
has O
just O
become O
ingrained O
in O
our O
lexicon O
now O
, O
but O
keep O
in O
mind O
that O
Apple O
started O
it O
all O
. O

By O
the O
way O
teachers O
, O
they O
offer O
a O
discount O
which O
helps O
! O

now O
he O
mows O
yards O
so O
he O
can O
earn O
the O
money O
for O
the O
wireless O
internet O
. O

I O
still O
see O
the O
benefits O
of O
a O
PC O
when O
I O
do O
not O
know O
how O
to O
do O
something O
on O
my O
mac O
. O

Size B-AS
, O
I O
know O
13 O
is O
small O
especially O
for O
a O
desktop O
replacement O
but O
with O
an O
external B-AS
monitor I-AS
, O
who O
cares O
. O

Additional O
caveat O
, O
the O
base B-AS
installation I-AS
comes O
with O
some O
Toshiba O
- O
specific O
software B-AS
that O
may O
or O
may O
not O
be O
to O
a O
user O
's O
liking O
. O

It O
is O
held O
in O
place O
magnetically O
. O

Taking O
it O
back O
to O
Best O
Buy O
I O
found O
that O
a O
tiny O
plastic O
piece O
inside O
had O
broken O
manuf B-AS
issue O
. O

It O
has O
no O
camera O
but O
, O
I O
can O
always O
buy O
and O
install O
one O
easy O
. O

The O
display B-AS
is O
incredibly O
bright O
, O
much O
brighter O
than O
my O
PowerBook O
and O
very O
crisp O
. O

We O
were O
PC O
users O
. O

The O
AMD B-AS
Turin I-AS
processor I-AS
seems O
to O
always O
perform O
so O
much O
better O
than O
Intel B-AS
. O

After O
that O
the O
said O
it O
was O
under O
warranty B-AS
. O

The O
start B-AS
menu I-AS
is O
not O
the O
easiest O
thing O
to O
navigate B-AS
due O
to O
the O
stacking O
. O

Only O
thing O
I O
would O
want O
to O
add O
to O
this O
is O
an O
internal O
bluray B-AS
read I-AS
/ I-AS
write I-AS
drive I-AS
. O

This O
computer O
was O
awful O
, O
I O
would O
never O
recomend O
it O
to O
another O
person O
. O

The O
service B-AS
tech I-AS
said O
he O
had O
tried O
to O
duplicate O
the O
damage O
and O
was O
n't O
able O
to O
recreate O
it O
therefore O
it O
had O
to O
be O
their O
defect O
. O

The O
tech B-AS
store I-AS
I O
purchased O
this O
from O
sent O
it O
back O
, O
, O
, O
, O
, O
eventually O
I O
got O
a O
new O
or O
repaired O
machine O
approximately O
3 O
weeks O
later O
. O

I O
loved O
it O
then O
, O
but O
unfortunately O
it O
was O
before O
the O
days O
of O
wireless O
internet O
. O

Really O
like O
the O
textured O
surface B-AS
which O
shows O
no O
fingerprints O
. O

I O
WILL O
NEVER O
AGAIN O
buy O
another O
Acer O
, O
not O
will O
I O
buy O
Gateway O
, O
or O
eMachine O
as O
they O
are O
all O
from O
the O
same O
company O
. O

The O
screen B-AS
is O
bright O
and O
the O
keyboard B-AS
is O
nice O
; O

I O
look O
forward O
to O
years O
of O
use O
, O
it O
has O
held O
up O
well O
over O
the O
years O
and O
it O
fits O
my O
needs O
very O
well O
. O

I O
m O
very O
happy O
with O
this O
computer O
! O

But O
the O
machine O
is O
awesome O
and O
iLife B-AS
is O
great O
and O
I O
love O
Snow B-AS
Leopard I-AS
X I-AS
. O

High O
price B-AS
tag I-AS
, O
however O
. O

I O
thought O
learning O
the O
Mac B-AS
OS I-AS
would O
be O
hard O
, O
but O
it O
is O
easily O
picked O
up O
if O
you O
are O
familiar O
with O
a O
PC O
. O

My O
kids O
have O
to O
take O
their O
PCs O
in O
once O
a O
year O
to O
have O
them O
de O
- O
bugged O
. O

I O
had O
static O
in O
the O
output O
, O
and O
I O
had O
to O
reduce O
the O
sound B-AS
output I-AS
quality I-AS
to O
FM O
as O
opposed O
to O
the O
default O
CD O
. O

It O
was O
a O
laugh O
too O
! O

Since O
I O
purchased O
my O
Toshiba O
netbook O
, O
I O
have O
been O
very O
pleased O
with O
it O
, O
I O
have O
a O
laptob O
and O
a O
desktop O
. O

I O
bought O
my O
macbook O
a O
few O
months O
ago O
and O
it O
has O
been O
my O
baby O
ever O
since O
. O

That O
is O
how O
it O
is O
able O
to O
function O
better O
than O
any O
other O
PC O
. O

I O
custom O
ordered O
the O
machine O
from O
HP O
and O
could O
NOT O
understand O
the O
techie B-AS
due O
to O
his O
accent O
. O

It O
is O
easy O
to O
use B-AS
and O
lightweight O
. O

I O
went O
to O
Toshiba B-AS
online I-AS
help I-AS
and O
found O
some O
suggestions O
to O
fix O
it O
. O

It O
is O
a O
bit O
heavy O
. O

after O
trying O
to O
get O
some O
help O
he O
disconnected O
on O
me O
. O

They O
also O
have O
a O
longer O
service B-AS
life I-AS
than O
other O
computers O
I O
have O
several O
friends O
who O
still O
use O
the O
older O
Apple O
PowerBooks O
. O

If O
you O
check O
you O
will O
find O
the O
same O
notebook O
with O
the O
above O
missing O
ports B-AS
and O
a O
dual O
core O
AMD O
or O
Intel O
processor B-AS
. O

This O
laptop O
is O
a O
great O
price B-AS
and O
has O
a O
sleek O
look B-AS
. O

I O
especially O
like O
the O
keyboard B-AS
which O
has O
chiclet O
type O
keys B-AS
. O

Small O
screen O
somewhat O
limiting O
but O
great O
for O
travel O
. O

One O
of O
the O
primary O
reasons O
why O
I O
purchased O
an O
IPad O
was O
to O
store O
photographs O
so O
that O
I O
could O
show O
to O
my O
customers O
. O

Runs O
Hot O
I O
thought O
we O
were O
paying O
for O
quality B-AS
in O
our O
decision O
to O
buy O
an O
Apple O
product O
. O

For O
the O
not O
so O
good O
, O
I O
got O
the O
stock B-AS
screen I-AS
, O
which O
is O
VERY O
glossy O
. O

The O
gray B-AS
color I-AS
was O
a O
good O
choice O
. O

This O
was O
the O
second O
computer O
and O
brand O
bought O
that O
day O
. O

Buy O
this O
. O

VERY O
disappointing O
, O

I O
love O
this O
product O
because O
it O
is O
Toshiba O
and O
its O
156 O
. O

I O
would O
like O
to O
have O
volume B-AS
buttons I-AS
rather O
than O
the O
adjustment O
that O
is O
on O
the O
front O
. O

This O
is O
my O
first O
computer O
purchase O

People O
know O
what O
they O
are O
talking O
about O
and O
they O
have O
pride O
in O
the O
product O
that O
they O
are O
selling O
. O

The O
processor B-AS
a O
AMD O
Semprom O
at O
21 O
ghz O
is O
a O
bummer O
it O
does O
not O
have O
the O
power O
for O
HD O
or O
heavy O
computing B-AS
. O

Would O
HIGHLY O
recommend O
this O
netbook O
though O
. O

I O
have O
had O
several O
machines O
over O
the O
years O
, O
both O
for O
personal O
and O
business O
use O
. O

I O
bought O
a O
protector B-AS
for O
my O
key B-AS
pad I-AS
and O
it O
works O
great O
, O

The O
magnetic B-AS
plug I-AS
- I-AS
in I-AS
power I-AS
charging I-AS
power I-AS
cord I-AS
is O
great O
I O
even O
put O
it O
to O
the O
test O
by O
accident O
excellent O
innovation O
! O

Well O
i O
got O
this O
computer O
from O
Best O
Buy O
and O
I O
have O
had O
nothing O
but O
problems O
I O
bought O
the O
computer O
with O
a O
virus O
. O

It O
seems O
they O
could O
have O
updated O
XP B-AS
and O
done O
without O
creating O
Vista B-AS
. O

It O
is O
easy O
to O
use B-AS
, O
fast O
and O
has O
great O
graphics B-AS
for O
the O
money O
. O

I O
decided O
I O
wanted O
a O
laptop O
so O
I O
went O
into O
the O
BBY O
store O
. O

I O
like O
how O
the O
Mac B-AS
OS I-AS
is O
so O
simple O
and O
easy O
to O
use B-AS
. O

While O
Apple O
's O
saving O
grace O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
they O
at O
least O
stand O
behind O
their O
products O
, O
and O
their O
support B-AS
is O
great O
, O
it O
would O
be O
nice O
if O
their O
products O
were O
more O
reliable O
to O
justify O
the O
premium O
. O

In O
the O
three O
years O
I O
' O
ve O
had O
my O
MacBook O
Pro O
, O
I O
have O
never O
had O
a O
virus O
on O
my O
computer O
, O
and O
I O
do O
a O
lot O
of O
work O
on O
the O
internet O
. O

I O
was O
ready O
to O
take O
it O
back O
for O
a O
refund O
, O
but O
the O
Geek B-AS
Squad I-AS
camed O
through O
and O
pointed O
me O
in O
the O
right O
direction O
to O
get O
it O
fixed O
. O

I O
have O
had O
laptops O
in O
the O
past O
and O
I O
thought O
why O
not O
give O
these O
small O
netbooks O
a O
try O
. O

It O
ca O
n't O
get O
any O
better O
. O

All O
the O
problems O
I O
have O
had O
with O
PC O
's O
are O
solved O
with O
a O
Mac O
, O
the O
issue O
of O
overheating O
- O
my O
Dell O
was O
always O
overheating O
and O
not O
working O
properly O
or O
simply O
shutting O
off O
, O
and O
the O
issue O
of O
viruses O
and O
contaminants O
- O
my O
HP O
completely O
quit O
working O
within2 O
years O
of O
purchasing O
it O
, O
with O
no O
inexpensive O
way O
of O
fixing O
it O
. O

only O
good O
thing O
is O
the O
graphics B-AS
quality I-AS
. O

The O
other O
lock O
- O
up O
problems O
are O
from O
a O
myriad O
of O
causes O
, O
the O
most O
common O
being O
a O
corrupted O
version O
of O
Appleworks B-AS
which O
can O
render O
the O
browser B-AS
useless O
. O

In O
short O
I O
would O
never O
buy O
a O
Compaq O
again O
. O

I O
love O
the O
15 O
MacBook O
Pro O
. O

breaks O
easily O
. O

The O
paint B-AS
wears O
off O
easily O
due O
to O
the O
keyboard B-AS
being O
farther O
back O
than O
usual O
. O

That O
's O
right O
, O
no O
power O
, O
absolutely O
NOTHING O
. O

I O
had O
purchased O
it O
from O
a O
major O
electronics O
store O
and O
took O
it O
to O
their O
service B-AS
department I-AS
to O
find O
out O
what O
the O
problem O
was O
. O

The O
store O
honored O
their O
warrenty B-AS
and O
made O
the O
comment O
that O
they O
do O
n't O
even O
recommend O
the O
HP O
brand O
because O
of O
the O
problems O
with O
their O
warrenty B-AS
. O

But O
I O
was O
wrong O
. O

NO O
good O
. O

I O
always O
use O
a O
backup O
hard B-AS
disk I-AS
to O
store O
important O
files O
at O
all O
times O
. O

They O
sent O
out O
the O
box O
right O
away O
for O
me O
to O
send O
in O
my O
computer O
, O
they O
paid O
postage O
and O
whatnot O
, O
but O
when O
I O
got O
my O
computer O
back O
it O
still O
was O
n't O
running B-AS
right O
, O
and O
now O
my O
CD B-AS
drive I-AS
was O
n't O
reading O
anything O
! O

I O
bought O
this O
laptop O
Was O
the O
worst O
Laptop O
I O
' O
ve O
ever O
bought O
. O

But O
the O
screen B-AS
size I-AS
is O
not O
that O
bad O
for O
email O
and O
web B-AS
browsing I-AS
. O

Once O
I O
removed O
all O
the O
software B-AS
the O
laptop O
loads B-AS
in O
15 O
- O
20 O
seconds O
. O

On O
my O
PowerBook O
G4 O
I O
would O
never O
use O
the O
trackpad B-AS
I O
would O
use O
an O
external B-AS
mouse I-AS
because O
I O
did O
n't O
like O
the O
trackpad B-AS
. O

This O
computer O
does O
n't O
do O
that O
well O
with O
certain O
games B-AS
it O
ca O
n't O
play O
some O
and O
it O
becomes O
too O
hot O
while O
playing O
games B-AS
. O

Obviously O
one O
of O
the O
most O
important O
features B-AS
of O
any O
computer O
is O
the O
human B-AS
interface I-AS
. O

Yeah O
, O
of O
course O
smarty O
pants O
fix O
it O
nowASPECT1 O
, O
Compared O
to O
the O
early O
2011 O
edition O
I O
did O
see O
inbuilt B-AS
applications I-AS
crashing O
and O
it O
prompted O
me O
to O
send O
the O
report O
to O
Apple O
which O
I O
promptly O
did O
. O

The O
body B-AS
is O
a O
bit O
cheaply O
made O
so O
it O
will O
be O
interesting O
to O
see O
how O
long O
it O
holds O
up O
. O

The O
i5 B-AS
blows O
my O
desktop O
out O
of O
the O
water O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
rendering O
videos O
. O

With O
a O
mac O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
antivirus B-AS
software I-AS
or O
firewall B-AS
, O
it O
's O
so O
wonderful O
. O

For O
the O
use O
it O
was O
purchased O
for O
it O
is O
a O
good O
Laptop O
. O

Am O
very O
glad O
I O
bought O
it O
, O
great O
netbook O
, O
low O
price B-AS
. O

Obviously O
, O
this O
Macbook O
is O
P O
- O
E O
- O
R O
- O
F O
- O
E O
- O
C O
- O
T O
for O
me O
because O
it O
does O
exactly O
what O
I O
need O
in O
an O
easy O
- O
to O
- O
function O
way O
. O

Worth O
the O
investment O
and O
truly O
a O
fine O
piece O
of O
equipment O
. O

The O
Apple B-AS
team I-AS
also O
assists O
you O
very O
nicely O
when O
choosing O
which O
computer O
is O
right O
for O
you O
, O

Summary O
, O
Do O
nt O
buy O
HP O
. O

I O
think O
part O
of O
the O
problem O
with O
this O
computer O
is O
Vista B-AS
, O
yet O
I O
know O
Vista B-AS
is O
n't O
the O
entire O
issue O
because O
my O
latest O
purchase O
was O
my O
Acer O
and O
it O
also O
has O
Vista B-AS
I O
should O
have O
waited O
the O
few O
months O
to O
get O
the O
next O
operating B-AS
system I-AS
. O

The O
video B-AS
chat I-AS
is O
the O
only O
thing O
that O
is O
iffy O
about O
it O
but O
i O
m O
sure O
once O
they O
unpdate O
the O
next O
version O
on O
the O
macbook O
book O
the O
quality O
of O
it O
will O
be O
better O
. O

You O
'll O
need O
to O
upgrade O
and O
pay O
a O
little O
more O
for O
them O
. O

it O
is O
hard O
to O
fix O
and O
makes O
it O
a O
hassle O
to O
own O
one O
. O

That O
whole O
experience O
was O
just O
ridiculous O
we O
sent O
it O
in O
and O
after O
they O
told O
us O
that O
we O
had O
to O
pay O
$ O
175 O
to O
fix O
it O
we O
were O
like O
we O
will O
just O
by O
a O
portable O
mouse B-AS
which O
would O
be O
way O
cheaper O
but O
they O
refused O
to O
send O
the O
laptop O
back O
until O
we O
paid O
the O
$ O
175 O
and O
it O
was O
fixed O
. O

Macs O
are O
designed O
for O
the O
frontal O
lobe O
challenged O
people O
out O
there O
. O

Fan B-AS
vents O
to O
the O
side O
, O
so O
no O
cooling B-AS
pad I-AS
needed O
, O
great O
feature B-AS
! O

i O
use O
my O
mac O
all O
the O
time O
, O
i O
love O
the O
software B-AS
, O
the O
way O
it O
takes O
a O
short O
time O
to O
load O
things O
, O
how O
easy O
it O
is O
to O
use O
and O
most O
of O
all O
how O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
viruses O
. O

Wasted O
me O
at O
least O
8 O
hours O
of O
installation B-AS
time I-AS
. O

It O
has O
far O
exceeded O
my O
expectations O
for O
power B-AS
, O
storage B-AS
, O
and O
abilitiy B-AS
. O

A O
great O
feature B-AS
is O
the O
spotlight B-AS
search I-AS
, O
one O
can O
search O
for O
documents O
by O
simply O
typing O
a O
keyword O
, O
rather O
than O
parsing O
tens O
of O
file O
folders O
for O
a O
document O
. O

My O
wireless B-AS
system I-AS
would O
not O
recognize O
Windows B-AS
7 I-AS
and O
I O
could O
n't O
get O
online O
to O
find O
out O
why O
. O

I O
am O
enjoying O
it O
and O
the O
quality B-AS
it O
provides O
is O
great O
! O

It O
is O
the O
worst O
laptop O
ever O

Suffice O
it O
to O
say O
, O
my O
MacBook O
Pro O
keeps O
me O
going O
with O
its O
long O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
and O
blazing O
speed B-AS
. O

I O
' O
m O
not O
going O
to O
lie O
, O
I O
' O
ve O
never O
really O
liked O
the O
Acer O
brand O
in O
general O
. O

The O
OS B-AS
is O
also O
very O
user O
friendly O
, O
even O
for O
those O
that O
switch O
from O
a O
PC O
, O
with O
a O
little O
practice O
you O
can O
take O
full O
advantage O
of O
this O
OS B-AS
! O

iTunes B-AS
is O
a O
handy O
music O
- O
management O
program B-AS
, O
and O
it O
is O
essential O
for O
anyone O
with O
an O
iPod O
. O

-I O
give O
up O
on O
my O
data O
, O
I O
just O
want O
a O
computer O
reasonably O
fast O
. O

Would O
buy O
100 O
more O
of O
these O
if O
I O
could O
. O

while O
it O
was O
barely O
a O
bargin O
in O
the O
begining O
, O
i O
would O
never O
purchase O
another O
dell O
and O
would O
not O
recomend O
the O
dell O
brand O
to O
others O
. O

it O
was O
shooting O
sparks O
! O

Great O
product O
. O

Mac O
is O
not O
made O
for O
gaming B-AS
. O

Well O
I O
spilled O
something O
on O
it O
and O
they O
replaced O
it O
with O
this O
model O
, O
which O
gets O
hot O
and O
the O
battery B-AS
does O
n't O
make O
it O
through O
1 O
DVD O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
had O
to O
call O
Apple B-AS
support I-AS
to O
set O
up O
my O
new O
printer O
and O
have O
had O
wonderful O
experiences O
with O
helpful O
, O
english O
speaking O
from O
Vancouver O
techs B-AS
that O
walked O
me O
through O
the O
processes O
to O
help O
me O
. O

But O
Sony O
said O
we O
could O
send O
it O
back O
and O
be O
charged O
for O
adding B-AS
the I-AS
bluetooth I-AS
an O
additional O
seventy O
something O
dollars O
. O

By O
this O
time O
I O
was O
regretting O
ever O
SEEING O
this O
machine O
on O
the O
shelf O
! O

Toshiba O
is O
a O
great O
brand O
, O
even O
though O
I O
have O
n't O
had O
it O
for O
a O
long O
time O
, O
I O
am O
very O
happy O
with O
it O
! O

I O
need O
graphic B-AS
power I-AS
to O
run O
my O
Adobe B-AS
Creative I-AS
apps I-AS
efficiently O
. O

the O
programs B-AS
are O
esay O
to O
use B-AS
and O
are O
quick O
to O
process O
this O
computer O
works O
like O
a O
charm O
. O

The O
materials B-AS
that O
came O
with O
the O
computer O
did O
not O
include O
the O
right O
# O
anywhere O
. O

So O
when O
you O
do O
call O
to O
complain O
about O
the O
hunk O
of O
metal O
you O
get O
the O
joy O
of O
speaking O
with O
a O
bunch O
of O
people O
you O
ca O
n't O
understand O
. O

That O
day O
! O

For O
one O
, O
I O
noticed O
that O
from O
turning O
on O
my O
mac O
to O
logging O
on O
only O
took O
about O
25 O
seconds O
. O

It O
does O
not O
even O
have O
the O
software B-AS
to O
play O
a O
dvd O
now O
. O

My O
brother O
is O
a O
computer O
wiz O
and O
would O
laugh O
at O
me O
because O
he O
used O
an O
Apple O
. O

Tech B-AS
support I-AS
tells O
me O
the O
latter O
problem O
is O
a O
power B-AS
supply I-AS
problem O
and O
have O
offered O
to O
fix O
it O
if O
it O
happens O
again O
. O

Since O
I O
never O
really O
got O
to O
use O
this O
, O
I O
ca O
n't O
comment O
on O
anything O
except O
what O
went O
wrong O
after O
trying O
2 O
of O
them O
. O

Buyers O
beware O
. O

HOW O
DOES O
THE O
POWER B-AS
SUPPLY I-AS
NOT O
WORK O
! O
! O
! O

Sells O
for O
the O
same O
as O
a O
netbook O
without O
sacrificing O
size B-AS
. O

I O
'll O
rather O
be O
out O
of O
date O
then O
spend O
more O
money O
on O
toshiba O
. O

upon O
giving O
them O
the O
serial O
number O
the O
first O
thing O
I O
was O
told O
, O
was O
that O
it O
was O
out O
of O
warranty B-AS
and O
I O
could O
pay O
to O
have O
it O
repaired O
. O

Windows B-AS
XP I-AS
SP2 I-AS
caused O
many O
problems O
on O
the O
computer O
, O
so O
I O
had O
to O
remove O
it O
. O

Love O
it O
. O

I O
reloaded O
with O
Windows B-AS
7 I-AS
Ultimate I-AS
, O
and O
the O
Bluetooth B-AS
and O
Fingerprint B-AS
reader I-AS
software I-AS
would O
not O
load O
. O

None O
of O
the O
techs B-AS
at I-AS
HP I-AS
knew O
what O
they O
were O
doing O
. O

Oh O
, O
it O
is O
such O
a O
great O
piece O
of O
equipment O
. O

this O
is O
my O
second O
one O
and O
the O
same O
problem O
, O
bad O
video B-AS
card I-AS
unreliable O
overall O
, O
this O
will O
be O
my O
second O
time O
returning O
this O
laptop O
back O
to O
best O
buy O
. O

I O
use O
that O
alot O
on O
my O
desktop O
, O
so O
I O
am O
adjusting O
to O
not O
having O
it O
. O

With O
awesome O
graphics B-AS
and O
assuring O
security B-AS
, O
it O
's O
perfect O
! O

Laptop O
was O
in O
new O
condition O
and O
operational O
, O
but O
for O
the O
audio B-AS
problem O
when O
1st O
sent O
for O
repair O
. O

I O
was O
disappointed O
when O
I O
realized O
that O
the O
keyboard B-AS
does O
n't O
light O
up O
on O
this O
model O
. O

This O
machine O
was O
a O
horrible O
experience O
. O

It O
runs B-AS
perfectly O
. O

Very O
dissappointed O
becase O
I O
have O
had O
toshibas O
for O
years O
, O
and O
never O
a O
issue O
. O

If O
you O
have O
any O
creativity O
in O
you O
do O
yourself O
a O
favor O
and O
get O
a O
mac O
! O

The O
laptop O
was O
very O
easy O
to O
set B-AS
up I-AS
. O

Congratulations O
Asus O
for O
creating O
one O
big O
piece O
of O
dump O
which O
is O
my O
laptop O
. O

Sometimes O
the O
screen B-AS
even O
goes O
black O
on O
this O
computer O
. O

I O
would O
definitely O
recommend O
checking O
out O
this O
laptop O
if O
you O
are O
in O
the O
market O
for O
one O
. O

I O
recommend O
for O
word B-AS
processing I-AS
and O
internet B-AS
users O
. O

Since O
I O
' O
ve O
had O
this O
computer O
I O
' O
ve O
only O
used O
the O
trackpad B-AS
because O
it O
is O
so O
nice O
and O
smooth O
. O

When O
the O
computer O
has O
been O
on O
for O
several O
minutes O
, O
it O
will O
occasionaly O
just O
go O
off O
by O
itself O
. O

A O
longer O
battery O
life O
would O
have O
been O
great O
, O
but O
it O
meets O
it O
's O
spec B-AS
quite O
easily O
. O

Who O
could O
n't O
love O
a O
DVD B-AS
burner I-AS
, O
80-gigabyte O
HD B-AS
, O
and O
fairly O
new O
graphics B-AS
chip I-AS
? O
As O
I O
soon O
discovered O
, O
though O
, O
there O
is O
a O
reason O
for O
which O
similarly O
- O
configured O
Sony O
and O
Toshiba O
machines O
cost O
more O
, O
they O
use O
higher O
- O
quality O
components B-AS
that O
are O
faster O
, O
better O
- O
configured O
, O
and O
end O
up O
lasting O
a O
lot O
longer O
. O

falls O
into O
the O
case O
. O

This O
is O
something O
i O
would O
deffinately O
reccomend O
to O
someone O
. O

Its O
fast O
and O
another O
thing O
I O
like O
is O
that O
it O
has O
three O
USB B-AS
ports I-AS
. O

Mac O
computers O
automatically O
defrag O
each O
time O
you O
start O
your O
computer O
. O

That O
is O
my O
only O
complaint O
! O

The O
salesman O
talked O
us O
into O
this O
computer O
away O
from O
another O
we O
were O
looking O
at O
and O
we O
have O
had O
nothing O
but O
problems O
with O
software B-AS
problems O
and O
just O
not O
happy O
with O
it O
. O

That O
system B-AS
is O
fixed O
. O

The O
computer O
itself O
was O
fast O
, O
ran B-AS
smoothly O
, O
and O
had O
no O
problems O
. O

One O
of O
the O
smartest O
thing O
I O
did O
was O
take O
my O
time O
to O
compare O
laptops O
before O
making O
my O
purchase O
. O

Like O
the O
price B-AS
and O
operation B-AS
. O

The O
brand B-AS
is O
tarnished O
in O
my O
heart O
. O

This O
is O
likely O
due O
to O
poor O
grounding O
and O
isolation O
between O
the O
components B-AS
, O
and O
I O
' O
m O
hoping O
that O
it O
can O
be O
fixed O
with O
a O
ground B-AS
loop I-AS
isolator I-AS
, O
but O
I O
still O
expected O
better O
product O
quality B-AS
for O
this O
price B-AS
range I-AS
. O

Honestly O
, O
this O
is O
absolutely O
wonderful O
. O

I O
have O
had O
it O
for O
about O
a O
1 O
1/2 O
and O
yes O
I O
have O
had O
an O
issue O
with O
it O
one O
month O
out O
of O
warranty B-AS
. O

I O
really O
wish O
I O
had O
done O
this O
years O
ago O
. O

Well O
, O
maybe O
I O
was O
just O
very O
unlucky O
. O

For O
example O
, O
when O
my O
husband O
turns O
the O
light O
out O
while O
I O
' O
m O
on O
the O
computer O
. O

Once O
open O
, O
the O
leading B-AS
edge I-AS
is O
razor O
sharp O
. O

Loaded O
with O
bloatware B-AS
. O

If O
you O
buy O
, O
pray O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
major O
prolems O
. O

Do O
n't O
get O
me O
wrong O
, O
I O
am O
no O
Microsoft O
hater O
, O
I O
' O
ve O
just O
managed O
to O
turn O
into O
a O
much O
bigger O
Apple O
fan O
because O
of O
this O
machine O
. O

HP O
refused O
to O
give O
me O
a O
new O
one O
and O
Wal O
Mart O
refused O
to O
take O
it O
back O
. O

Within O
3 O
weeks O
the O
same O
issues O
started O
happening O
AGAIN O
. O

Maximum B-AS
sound I-AS
is O
n't O
nearly O
as O
loud O
as O
it O
should O
be O
. O

Well O
, O
they O
do O
n't O
care O
a O
bunch O
. O

I O
loaded O
windows B-AS
7 I-AS
via O
Bootcamp B-AS
and O
it O
works O
flawlessly O
! O

I O
have O
never O
had O
to O
shut O
down O
the O
computer O
unexpectedly O
and O
the O
computer O
has O
never O
froze O
on O
me O
. O

Great O
Laptop O
for O
the O
price B-AS
, O
works B-AS
well O
with O
action B-AS
pack I-AS
games I-AS
. O

Although O
the O
price B-AS
is O
higher O
then O
Dell O
laptops O
, O
the O
Macbooks O
are O
worth O
the O
dough O
. O

Recommended O
to O
people O
as O
their O
first O
laptop O
. O

I O
would O
recomend O
this O
acer O
to O
parents O
and O
grandparents O
it O
can O
really O
help O
them O
in O
school O
. O

I O
would O
not O
recommend O
this O
to O
anyone O
wanting O
a O
notebook O
expecting O
the O
performance B-AS
of O
a O
Desktop O
it O
does O
not O
meet O
the O
expectations O
. O

The O
Macbook O
arrived O
in O
a O
nice O
twin B-AS
packing I-AS
and O
sealed O
in O
the O
box O
, O
all O
the O
functions B-AS
works O
great O
. O

So O
what O
if O
the O
laptops O
/ O
mobile O
phones O
look B-AS
chic O
and O
cool O
? O
The O
after B-AS
sales I-AS
support I-AS
is O
terrible O
. O

they O
have O
not O
sent O
a O
new O
one O
nor O
called O
. O

I O
would O
easly O
reccomend O
this O
laptop O
to O
a O
friend O
. O

I O
hate O
the O
display B-AS
screen I-AS
and O
I O
have O
done O
everything O
I O
could O
do O
the O
change O
it O
. O

I O
spent O
alot O
of O
money O
on O
this O
product O
and O
its O
been O
a O
nightmare O
. O

I O
also O
like O
the O
acer B-AS
arcade I-AS
but O
these O
were O
reallythe O
only O
two O
things O
I O
liked O
about O
this O
laptop O
. O

Have O
not O
yet O
needed O
any O
customer B-AS
support I-AS
with O
this O
yet O
so O
to O
me O
that O
is O
a O
great O
thing O
, O
which O
is O
leaps O
and O
bounds O
ahead O
of O
PC O
in O
my O
opinion O
. O

Thinking O
about O
returning O
it O

I O
gave O
it O
to O
my O
daughter O
because O
I O
just O
hated O
the O
screen B-AS
, O
hated O
that O
it O
had O
no O
cd B-AS
drive I-AS
to O
at O
least O
play O
cd O
's O
when O
I O
wanted O
to O
listen O
to O
music O
and O
do O
schoolwork O
. O

It O
runs B-AS
very O
quiet O
too O
which O
is O
a O
plus O
. O

but O
it O
has O
a O
major O
design B-AS
flaw O
. O

I O
took O
the O
laptop O
home O
and O
not O
even O
a O
month O
later O
, O
I O
began O
to O
have O
problems O
with O
it O
. O

It O
was O
heavy O
, O
bulky O
, O
and O
hard O
to O
carry O
because O
of O
the O
size B-AS
. O

That O
was O
my O
first O
Apple O
product O
and O
since O
then O
I O
have O
been O
incredibly O
happy O
with O
every O
product O
of O
theirs O
I O
have O
bought O
. O

i O
tried O
turning O
it O
done O
but O
it O
did O
nothing O
. O

It O
is O
super O
fast O
, O
and O
always O
loads O
. O

The O
games B-AS
included O
are O
very O
good O
games B-AS
. O

this O
computer O
will O
last O
you O
at O
least O
7 O
years O
, O
that O
s O
an O
amazing O
life B-AS
spanned O
an O
electronic O
. O

I O
bought O
mine O
from O
Apple O
Store O
the O
day O
it O
was O
released O
as O
Amazon O
did O
n't O
have O
it O
yet O
. O

I O
had O
something O
else O
go O
wrong O
and O
they O
said O
it O
had O
to O
be O
in O
good O
working O
order O
to O
be O
able O
to O
buy O
the O
warranty B-AS
. O

the O
whole O
experiece O
is O
horrible O
so O
save O
up O
and O
buy O
a O
better O
laptop O
. O

I O
just O
bought O
this O
laptop O
3 O
days O
ago O
. O

I O
am O
very O
pleased O
with O
my O
purchase O
! O

Sometimes O
you O
really O
have O
to O
tap O
the O
pad B-AS
to O
get O
it O
to O
worki O

It O
's O
super O
fast O
and O
a O
great O
value B-AS
for O
the O
price B-AS
! O

Three O
, O
the O
mac O
book O
has O
advantages O
over O
pcs O
with O
linux B-AS
based I-AS
os I-AS
there O
is O
very O
few O
problems O
with O
system B-AS
performance I-AS
when O
it O
comes O
to O
a O
mac O
. O

A O
mac O
is O
very O
easy O
to O
use B-AS
and O
it O
simply O
makes O
sense O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
eMachines O
can O
not O
be O
made O
entirely O
to O
blame O
for O
this O
computer O
's O
woes O
; O

however O
, O
I O
may O
have O
inadvertently O
thrown O
out O
one O
of O
the O
batteries B-AS
with O
the O
shipping B-AS
carton I-AS
. O

Love O
it O
so O
far O
. O

It O
is O
so O
much O
easier O
to O
use B-AS

There O
is O
no O
need O
to O
open O
a O
program B-AS
first O
and O
the O
cliick O
open O
or O
import O
. O

In O
short O
, O
you O
could O
say O
your O
mac O
could O
become O
your O
best O
friend O
no O
intention O
of O
replacing O
Rover O
your O
dog O
. O

It O
was O
a O
bad O
experience O
but O
i O
played O
down O
its O
importance O
. O

Meets O
my O
needs O
perfectly O
and O
is O
light O
enough O
for O
this O
senior O
to O
carry O
without O
affecting O
my O
arthritis O
. O

It O
is O
so O
nice O
not O
to O
worry O
about O
that O
and O
the O
extra O
expense O
that O
comes O
along O
with O
the O
necessary O
virus B-AS
protection I-AS
on O
PC O
's O
. O

The O
Notebook O
PC O
, O
Toshiba O
Qosmio O
is O
the O
best O
gift O
my O
father O
could O
have O
ever O
gotten O
me O
. O

Three O
weeks O
after O
I O
bought O
the O
netbook O
, O
the O
screen B-AS
quit O
working O
. O

The O
processor B-AS
screams O
, O
and O
because O
of O
the O
unique O
way O
that O
Apple O
OSX B-AS
16 I-AS
functions O
, O
most O
of O
the O
graphics B-AS
are O
routed O
through O
the O
hardware B-AS
rather O
than O
the O
software B-AS
. O

I O
am O
currently O
out O
of O
town O
and O
called O
to O
inform O
them O
the O
broken O
part O
would O
be O
returned O
when O
I O
got O
back O
in O
town O
. O

Returned O
laptop O
for O
a O
4th O
repair O
and O
it O
came O
back O
but O
now O
would O
lock O
up O
and O
randomly O
reboot O
frequently O
making O
the O
laptop O
unusable O
. O

I O
wanted O
something O
that O
had O
a O
new O
Intel B-AS
Core I-AS
processors I-AS
and O
HDMI B-AS
port I-AS
so O
that O
we O
could O
hook O
it O
up O
directly O
to O
our O
TV O
. O

The O
Apple O
will O
run O
Internet O
Explorer O
, O
but O
at O
an O
amazingly O
slow O
rate O
. O

With O
today O
's O
company O
fighting O
over O
marketshare O
, O
its O
a O
shame O
that O
ASUS O
can O
get O
away O
with O
the O
inept O
staff B-AS
answering O
thephone O
. O

Other O
than O
that O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
one O
complaint O
in O
the O
world O
! O

The O
computer O
is O
so O
slow O
, O
even O
after O
paying O
staples O
the O
extra O
money O
to O
speed O
it O
up O
. O

I O
feel O
that O
enough O
people O
have O
Macs O
these O
days O
and O
that O
companies O
need O
to O
start O
making O
things O
more O
compatable O
than O
they O
used O
to O
be O
. O

The O
price B-AS
premium I-AS
is O
a O
little O
much O
, O
but O
when O
you O
start O
looking O
at O
the O
features B-AS
it O
is O
worth O
the O
added O
cash O
. O

* O
5 O
weeks O
after O
giving O
the O
computer O
for O
repair*-Apple O
offers O
to O
send O
replacement O
after O
they O
receive O
the O
old O
computer O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
say O
enough O
of O
how O
satisfied O
I O
am O
with O
their O
product B-AS
and I-AS
help I-AS
aftermarket I-AS
. O

My O
computer O
was O
one O
of O
the O
best O
in O
the O
school O
compared O
to O
my O
fellow O
classmates O
. O

I O
bought O
for O
my O
son O
in O
the O
2nd O
grade O
. O

This O
has O
happened O
three O
times O
so O
far O
. O

I O
' O
m O
a O
professional O
consultant O
, O
and O
a O
client O
needed O
work O
on O
her O
machine O
. O

compresses O
itself O
and O
you O
ca O
n't O
use O
it O
. O

Microsoft B-AS
word I-AS
was O
not O

Who O
knows O
what O
will O
happen O
later O
on O
when O
they O
dismantle O
the O
whole O
damn O
thing O
? O
So O
, O
I O
said O
I O

If O
you O
already O
own O
a O
2009 O
, O
2010 O
, O
or O
early O
2011 O

you O
should O
wait O
until O
the O
next O
update O
. O

My O
Toshiba O
did O
not O
have O
sound B-AS
on O
everything O
, O
just O
certain O
things O
. O

I O
am O
overall O
very O
pleased O
with O

like O
the O

So O
, O
I O
must O
say O
I O
am O
not O
a O
happy O
camper O

-Called O

I O
bought O
it O
during O
the O
recent O
Comex O
IT O

The O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
was O
shorter O
than O
expected O

It O

I O
have O
never O

It O

? O
It O
will O
NOT O

I O
have O

My O

me O
crazy O
when O
I O
want O
to O
download O
a O

something O
of O
that O
nature O
and O
I O
ca O

its O
not O
compatable O
with O

With O
a O

shut B-AS
down I-AS

all O
the O

It O
was O
very O
easy O

It O

not O
take O
long O
to O

This O

had O
exactly O
the O

I O
needed O

Overall O
, O
still O
a O
very O
nice O
machine O

Where O
you O

you O

My O
kids O
and O
dogs O
destroyed O
two O
power B-AS
cords I-AS
by O
pulling O
on O
them O
. O

I O
had O
upgraded O
my O
old O
MacBook O
to O
Lion O
, O
so O
I O
kind O
of O
knew O
what O
I O
was O
getting O
, O
but O
had O
n't O
been O
able O
to O
enjoy O
some O
of O
the O
awesome O
new O
multi B-AS
- I-AS
touch I-AS

I O
had O
this O
computer O
for O
one O
month O
and O
had O
to O
send O
it O
in O
for O
repair O
. O

The O
screen B-AS
is O
a O
little O
glary O
, O
and O
I O
hated O
the O
clicking B-AS
buttons I-AS
, O
but O
I O
got O
used O
to O
them O
. O

Not O
to O
mention O
, O
the O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
is O
absolutely O
amazing O
. O

I O
realize O
that O
not O
every O

has O
this O
issue O

but O
the O
ones O
that O
do O
can O
not O
be O
repaired O

I O
have O
had O
a O
Mac O
for O
6 O
years O
and O
wo O
n't O
go O
back O
to O
PC O
. O

i O
love O
to O
use O
it O
it O
is O
esay O
and O
light O
. O

Windows B-AS
also O
shuts O
the O
computer O
down O
for O
no O
reason O
without O
warning O
. O

not O
using O
wired B-AS
lan I-AS
not O
sure O
what O
that O
s O
about O
. O

After O
about O
another O
month O
I O
had O
to O
send O
it O
in O
AGAIN O
to O
Acer O
for O
repairs O
. O

The O
macbook O
rarely O
requires O
a O
hard O
reboot O
. O

I O
LOVE O
it O
! O

The O
# O
1 O
reason O
that O
is O
always O
repeated O
. O

Now O
for O
the O
hardware B-AS
problems O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
that O
is O
not O
the O
case O
. O

Anyways O
I O
bought O
this O
two O
months O
ago O
and O
when O
I O
first O
brought O
it O
home O
it O
kept O
giving O
me O
a O
message O
about O
a O
vibration O
in O
the O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
and O
it O
is O
putting O
it O
temporaly O
in O
save O
zone O
. O

It O
's O
fast O
and O
has O
excellent O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
. O

It O
's O
face O
and O
depanable O
. O

No O
Viruses O
! O

I O
' O
m O
just O
really O
happy O
that O
I O
waited O
to O
buy O
, O
because O
this O
thing O
kicks O
a O
$ O
$ O
! O

The O
Hewitt O
Packard O
Pavillion O
dv6700 O
was O
my O
first O
laptop O
, O
before O
this O
I O
had O
a O
Dell O
desktop O
that O
I O
loved O
. O

Apple B-AS
care I-AS
included O
. O

It O
was O
an O
all O
around O
waste O
of O
money O
for O
me O
. O

I O
worked O
in O
IT O
retail O
sales O
before O
. O

Features B-AS
like O
the O
font B-AS
are O
very O
block O
- O
like O
and O
old O
school O
. O

It O
has O
everything O
you O
need O
to O
get O
the O
job O
done O
. O

It O
is O
loaded O
with O
programs B-AS
that O
is O
of O
no O
good O
for O
the O
average O
user O
, O
that O
makes O
it O
run B-AS
way O
to O
slow O
. O

I O
feel O
that O
it O
was O
poorly O
put O
together O
, O
because O
once O
in O
a O
while O
different O
plastic B-AS
pieces I-AS
would O
come O
off O
of O
it O
. O

it O
ca O
n't O
fuction O
well O
with O
lots O
of O
webpages O
open O
at O
once O
. O

Finally O
, O
I O
should O
note O
that O
I O
took O
the O
2 B-AS
GB I-AS
RAM I-AS
stick I-AS
from O
my O
old O
EeePC O
and O
installed O
it O
before O
I O
even O
powered O
on O
for O
the O
first O
time O
. O

This O
laptop O
has O
left O
me O
with O
a O
HORRIBLE O
taste O
in O
my O
mouth O
for O
Acer O
brand O
products O
. O

its O
not O
bad O
just O
VERY O
VERY O
annoying O
. O

Well O
, O
maybe O
more O
like O
week O
one O
. O

Windows B-AS
is O
also O
rather O
unsteady O
on O
its O
feet O
and O
is O
susceptible O
to O
many O
bugs O
. O

After O
sending O
out O
documents O
via O
email O
and O
having O
recipients O
tell O
me O
they O
could O
not O
open O
the O
documents O
or O
they O
came O
through O
as O
gibberish O
, O
I O
broke O
down O
and O
spent O
another O
$ O
100 O
to O
get O
Microsoft B-AS
Word I-AS
for I-AS
Mac I-AS
. O

I O
believe O
I O
purchased O
this O
in O
Dec O
09 O
for O
my O
primary O
work O
laptop O
which O
is O
used O
5 O
- O
10 O
hours O
a O
day O
, O
4 O
- O
6 O
days O
a O
week O
. O

DO O
NOT O
BUY O
GATEWAY O
COMPUTERS O
THEY O
ARE O
JUNK O
AND O
THE O
WARRANTY B-AS
COMPANY I-AS
IS O
HORRIBLE O
. O

then O
on O
top O
of O
it O
all O
their O
cusromer B-AS
service I-AS
center I-AS
is O
in O
the O
middle O
east O
. O

The O
only O
bad O
part O
is O
the O
size B-AS
. O

The O
little O
battery B-AS
that O
it O
did O
have O
would O
only O
last O
about O
an O
hour O
while O
just O
having O
it O
on O
the O
desktop O
. O

I O
liked O
the O
aluminum B-AS
body I-AS
. O

also O
it O
is O
light O
weight O
compared O
to O
others O
. O

Its O
good O
for O
playing B-AS
my O
apps O
on O
Facebook O
or O
watching B-AS
movies I-AS
. O

From O
the O
build B-AS
quality I-AS
to O
the O
performance B-AS
, O
everything O
about O
it O
has O
been O
sub O
- O
par O
from O
what O
I O
would O
have O
expected O
from O
Apple O
. O

I O
love O
the O
dock B-AS
where O
I O
can O
simply O
drop O
a O
file O
ontop O
of O
a O
particular O
program B-AS
, O
and O
the O
program B-AS
will O
simply O
open O
that O
file O
. O

Sorry O
, O
newegg O
. O

Be O
safe O
buy O
a O
Sony O
. O

pretty O
much O
everything O
else O
about O
the O
computer O
is O
good O
it O
just O
stops O
working B-AS
out O
of O
no O
were O
. O

Originally O
bought O
it O
for O
my O
wife O
. O

It O
was O
truly O
a O
great O
computer O
costing B-AS
less O
than O
one O
thousand O
bucks O
before O
tax O
. O

Waiting O
for O
the O
i7 B-AS
was O
well O
worth O
it O
, O
great O
value O
for O
the O
price B-AS
. O

I O
bought O
this O
laptop O
on O
Saturday O
and O
am O
completely O
in O
love O
with O
it O
! O

I O
asked O
how O
they O
would O
determine O
that O
since O
there O
are O
no O
scratches O
, O
dents O
or O
other O
signs O
of O
damage O
and O
was O
told O
that O
was O
the O
only O
way O
this O
type O
of O
damage O
could O
happen O
. O

Now O
, O
, O
, O
, O
, O
my O
monitor B-AS
has O
been O
acting O
up O
for O
about O
2 O
months O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
extended B-AS
warranty I-AS
was O
a O
problem O
. O

Boots B-AS
up I-AS
fast O
and O
runs B-AS
great O
! O

Lightweight O
and O
the O
screen B-AS
is O
beautiful O
! O

Buy O
it O
, O
love O
it O
, O
and O
I O
promise O
you O
wo O
n't O
regret O
it O
. O

I O
needed O
a O
driver B-AS
for O
my O
HP O
and O
they O
would O
not O
help O
me O
with O
out O
me O
paying O
over O
$ O
50 O
for O
it O
. O

If O
you O
do O
n't O
like O
fingerprints O
, O
this O
might O
not O
be O
the O
laptop O
for O
you O
. O

Call O
tech B-AS
support I-AS
, O
standard O
email O
the O
form O
and O
fax O
it O
back O
in O
to O
us O
. O

Just O
a O
month O
and O
a O
half O
or O
two O
months O
ago O
, O
my O
VAIO O
crashed O
again O
. O

They O
sent O
it O
back O
with O
a O
huge O
crack O
in O
it O
and O
it O
still O
did O
n't O
work B-AS
. O

A O
coupla O
months O
later O
, O
they O
change O
my O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
. O

I O
did O
contact O
HP O
and O
share O
how O
unhappy O
I O
am O
. O

The O
Macbook O
arrived O
in O
a O
nice O
twin B-AS
packing I-AS
and O
sealed O
in O
the O
box O
, O
all O
the O
functions B-AS
works O
great O
. O

The O
13 O
MacBook O
Pro O
is O
portable O
, O
durable O
, O
and O
very O
capable O
. O

I O
should O
have O
spent O
an O
extra O
hundred O
bucks O
and O
got O
a O
full O
sized O
computer O
. O

Great O
overall O
. O

My O
smart O
phone O
is O
faster O
! O

They O
say O
sorry O
out O
of O
warranty B-AS
. O

I O
have O
full O
control O
at O
all O
times O
of O
what O
is O
going O
on O
, O
there O
is O
no O
control+alt+delete O
business O
anymore O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
laptop O
because O
of O
the O
performance B-AS
to O
price B-AS
ratio O
. O

PC O
never O
worked O
right O
even O
after O
BIOS B-AS
fixed O
. O

After O
having O
two O
PC O
laptops O
die O
with O
in O
the O
past O
3 O
years O
, O
I O
was O
led O
to O
the O
Apple O
display O
at O
Best O
Buy O
by O
the O
sleek O
design B-AS
and O
promise O
of O
less O
tech B-AS
issues I-AS
. O

I O
have O
a O
laptop O
as O
my O
regular O
computer O
, O
but O
found O
that O
disconnecting O
it O
and O
lugging O
it O
around O
was O
a O
drag O
. O

This O
is O
my O
second O
MacBook O
. O

The O
size B-AS
is O
perfect O
and O
I O
do O
not O
recomend O
anything O
bigger O
except O
for O
any O
person O
who O
can O
exceed O
the O
limited O
space B-AS
it O
gives O
you O
. O

The O
service B-AS
I O
received O
from O
Toshiba O
went O
above O
and O
beyond O
the O
call O
of O
duty O
. O

Have O
had O
many O
higher O
priced B-AS
computers O
crash O
and O
burn O
long O
before O
ever O
got O
to O
use O
all O
that O
great O
memory B-AS
and O
speed B-AS
, O
etc O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
it O
just O
because O
of O
the O
internet B-AS
speed I-AS
probably O
because O
that O
s O
the O
only O
thing O
i O
really O
care O
about O
. O

I O
own O
other O
Macs O
but O
always O
find O
myself O
navigation O
to O
the O
MacBook O
Pro O
to O
get O
my O
work O
done O
. O

There O
are O
several O
programs B-AS
for O
Garageband B-AS
Pages I-AS
, O
Garageband B-AS
, O
Garageband B-AS
, O
etc O
, O
music B-AS
Garageband I-AS
, O
photo B-AS
management I-AS
Photo I-AS
Booth I-AS
, O
iPhoto B-AS
, O
video B-AS
- I-AS
editing I-AS
or O
movie B-AS
- I-AS
making I-AS
iMovie I-AS
, O
etc O
. O

This O
is O
my O
3rd O
Apple O
Laptop O
and O
first O
MacBook O
Pro O
. O

I O
have O
had O
this O
laptop O
for O
a O
few O
months O
now O
and O
i O
would O
say O
i O
m O
pretty O
satisfied O
. O

The O
love O
part O
of O
my O
relationship O
with O
this O
laptop O
does O
n't O
take O
very O
long O
. O

Not O
enough O
time O
for O
me O
to O
give O
it O
5 O
stars O
! O

The O
screen B-AS
shows O
great O
colors B-AS
. O

Reason O
why O
? O
It O
's O
because O
when O
you O
buy O
it O
, O
you O
know O
first O
thing O
that O
you O
will O
not O
lose O
any O
value B-AS
for O
that O
laptop O
, O
the O
price B-AS
will O
stay O
the O
same O
for O
the O
next O
year O
, O
and O
even O
if O
Apple O
does O
decides O
to O
change O
mode O
, O
your O
laptop O
value B-AS
will O
only O
drop O
10 O
- O
20 O
% O
, O
unlike O
PC O
laptops O
which O
drop O
more O
than O
80 O
% O
. O

That O
's O
a O
huge O
difference O
. O

Dells O
are O
ok O
, O
HPs O
are O
n't O
that O
good O
, O
but O
Macs O
or O
Fantastic O
. O

So O
, O
buyers O
beware O
! O

I O
am O
totally O
satisfied O
with O
my O
little O
toshie O
! O

I O
have O
no O
idea O
how O
to O
burn B-AS
cd I-AS
's I-AS
or O
to O
use O
the O
web B-AS
cam I-AS
, O
just O
for O
starters O
. O

Again O
, O
I O
sent O
it O
off O
to O
Acer O
, O
by O
this O
time O
they O
were O
paying O
for O
me O
to O
send O
it O
to O
them O
and O
everything O
, O
but O
it O
was O
still O
inconvienent O
because O
of O
my O
classes O
and O
my O
communication O
with O
my O
fiance O
. O

DEFINITELY O
recommended O
! O
! O
! O

It O
is O
extremely O
user O
friendly O
and O
intuitive O
. O

Let O
me O
start O
with O
the O
good O
, O
So O
awesome O
. O

I O
had O
finally O
reached O
my O
limit O
and O
broke O
down O
. O

The O
17 B-AS
inch I-AS
screen I-AS
is O
very O
large O
, O
but O
the O
computer O
is O
very O
light O
. O

My O
opinion O
of O
Sony O
has O
been O
dropping O
as O
fast O
as O
the O
stock O
market O
, O
given O
their O
horrible O
support B-AS
, O
but O
this O
machine O
just O
caused O
another O
plunge O
. O

Do O
I O
like O
the O
computer O
? O
Well O
, O
other O
than O
not O
getting O
viruses O
, O
I O
guess O
it O
is O
OK O
. O

For O
the O
Bluetooth B-AS
to O
work O
properly O
, O
you O
must O
install O
the O
Launch B-AS
Manager I-AS
on O
the O
Drivers B-AS
/ I-AS
Applications I-AS
DVD I-AS
, O
or O
it O
will O
not O
show O
after O
the O
reload O
. O

I O
waited O
and O
waited O
and O
no O
laptop O
. O

Everything O
is O
falling O
apart O
internally O
and O
externally O
. O

I O
also O
liked O
the O
glass B-AS
screen I-AS
. O

The O
switchable B-AS
graphic I-AS
card I-AS
is O
pretty O
sweet O
when O
you O
want O
gaming B-AS
on O
the O
laptop O
. O

It O
super O
shiny O
, O
so O
you O
can O
see O
the O
fingerprints O
easily O
. O

It O
's O
not O
a O
wear O
- O
and O
- O
tear O
issue O
, O
not O
due O
to O
user O
carelessness O
and O
most O
importantly O
, O
they O
CA O
N'T O
guarantee O
the O
problem O
will O
be O
solved O
if O
it O
is O
sent O
for O
service B-AS
and O
I O
have O
to O
accept O
the O
outcome O
. O

The O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
has O
not O
decreased O
since O
I O
bought O
it O
, O
so O
i O
' O
m O
thrilled O
with O
that O
. O

Its O
a O
dog O
plain O
and O
simple O
. O

When O
I O
called O
Toshiba O
, O
they O
would O
not O
do O
anything O
and O
even O
tried O
to O
charge O
me O
$ O
35 O
for O
the O
phone O
call O
, O
even O
though O
they O
did O
n't O
offer O
any O
technical B-AS
support I-AS
. O

My O
HP O
is O
very O
heavy O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
notebook O
and O
only O
had O
it O
for O
3 O
months O
If O
it O
is O
overload O
with O
updates O
the O
BOOT B-AS
MGR I-AS
. O

Oh O
and O
if O
that O
s O
not O
bad O
enough O
it O
does O
n't O
come O
with O
a O
recovery B-AS
cd I-AS
so O
you O
can O
make O
one O
if O
you O
know O
how O
to O
or O
buy O
one O
if O
you O
buy O
it O
the O
cost O
is O
$ O
25 O
for O
two O
cds O
. O

The O
price B-AS
and O
features B-AS
more O
than O
met O
my O
needs O
. O

They O
refuse O
. O

big O
mistake O
! O

Best O
Buy O
was O
great O
as O
always O
and O
accepted O
the O
return O
and O
gave O
me O
another O
model O
1764 O
. O

and O
dell O
and O
best O
buy O
both O
refused O
to O
take O
it O
back O
after O
i O
only O
had O
it O
for O
1 O
hour O
. O

My O
friends O
or O
children O
use O
that O
when O
they O
need O
to O
borrow O
the O
Net O
When O
I O
out O
grow O
this O
Meaning O
when O
its O
old O
and O
my O
oldest O
child O
is O
ready O
for O
one O
she O
will O
get O
this O
one O
ANd O
I O
will O
be O
buying O
only O
TOSHIBA O
! O

First O
of O
all O
, O
I O
' O
ve O
been O
Dell O
fan O
for O
more O
than O
fifteen O
years O
. O

GREAT O
INVESTMENT O
! O

I O
am O
just O
amazed O
. O

I O
burned O
my O
leg O
, O
after O
lifting O
it O
from O
my O
desk O
, O
and O
for O
less O
than O
5 O
second O
putting O
it O
on O
my O
lap O
to O
clean O
my O
coffee O
table O
, O
so O
I O
can O
place O
it O
there O
. O

I O
thought O
all O
my O
problems O
would O
finally O
be O
solved O
being O
that O
my O
old O
computer O
would O
n't O
go O
onto O
our O
wireless O
network O
and O
I O
would O
n't O
have O
the O
same O
problems O
because O
it O
was O
updated O
. O

Skype B-AS
is O
just O
so O
dang O
cool O
with O
this O
machine O
too O
. O

I O
would O
buy O
this O
lap O
top O
over O
and O
over O
again O
! O

the O
mouse B-AS
buttons I-AS
are O
hard O
to O
push O
. O

I O
can O
actually O
get O
work O
done O
with O
this O
MAC O
, O
and O
not O
fight O
with O
it O
like O
my O
tired O
old O
PC O
laptop O
. O

Also O
, O
HDD B-AS
secures O
inside O
using O
rails B-AS
, O
and O
there O
is O
only O
one O
set O
on O
the O
main O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
. O

If O
you O
're O
not O
wanting O
to O
be O
mobile O
, O
this O
is O
a O
good O
laptop O
to O
sit O
on O
a O
desk O
. O

I O
also O
travel O
with O
it O
and O
it O
never O
gives O
me O
any O
problems O
. O

Just O
do O
n't O
waste O
your O
time O
and O
money O
on O
this O
. O

All O
I O
will O
say O
now O
is O
that O
it O
was O
over O
two O
grand O
less O
expensive O
and O
so O
much O
better O
quality B-AS
than O
my O
hunk O
of O
crap O
Vaio O
. O

Beware O
, O
their O
staff B-AS
could O
send O
you O
back O
making O
you O
feel O
that O
only O
they O
know O
what O
a O
computer O
is O
. O

And O
I O
' O
m O
still O
paying O
the O
bloody O
financing O
, O
for O
a O
product O
which O
did O
n't O
last O
me O
at O
least O
three O
years O
! O

Games B-AS
being O
the O
main O
issue O
. O

No O
problems O
, O
no O
lock O
ups O
, O
no O
disappointments O
. O

While O
the O
computer O
seems O
to O
be O
set O
up O
in O
a O
common O
sense O
way O
rather O
than O
in O
geek O
- O
speak O
, O
there O
are O
certain O
quirks O
that O
can O
drive O
you O
crazy O
trying O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
PC O
world O
. O

I O
am O
definitely O
sold O
, O
and O
not O
going O
back O
to O
PCs O
for O
home O
use O
! O

I O
have O
a O
lapdesk O
which O
I O
can O
use O
, O
but O
I O
can O
still O
feel O
the O
heat O
through O
the O
foam O
and O
plastic O
. O

and O
its O
really O
cheap O
and O
you O
wo O
nt O
regret O
buying O
it O
. O

It O
was O
over O
rated O
! O

I O
do O
n't O
understand O
how O
anyone O
can O
think O
this O
is O
a O
great O
product O
worth O
purchasing O
. O

My O
sister O
has O
the O
same O
Mac O
as O
me O
and O
she O
is O
in O
a O
band O
and O
uses O
GarageBand B-AS
to O
record O
and O
edit O
. O

I O
was O
n't O
really O
sure O
I O
wanted O
to O
spend O
that O
kind O
of O
money O
! O

Other O
Thoughts O
, O
Do O
not O
purchase O
this O
product O
. O

They O
say O
that O
this O
will O
invalidate O
the O
warranty B-AS
on O
the O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
I O
do O
n't O
really O
understand O
why O
but O
anyway O
. O

and O
looks O
very O
sexyy O
, O
D O
really O
the O
mac O
book O
pro O
is O
the O
best O
laptop O
specially O
for O
students O
in O
college O
if O
you O
are O
not O
caring O
about O
price B-AS
. O

I O
took O
the O
computer O
back O
in O
yet O
again O
except O
this O
time O
they O
kept O
it O
to O
send O
into O
their O
Geek O
Squad O
headquarters O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
laptop O
and O
I O
would O
recommend O
it O
to O
anyone O
. O

Thank O
God O
for O
ctrl O
ZBottom O
line O
, O
I O
' O
ve O
been O
using O
laptops O
since O
the O
mid O
90s O
and O
probably O
the O
majority O
of O
brands O
out O
there O
. O

They O
definitely O
have O
a O
superior O
product O
! O

A O
great O
computer O
for O
light O
home B-AS
use I-AS
and O
business B-AS
use I-AS
. O

Bought O
it O
to O
use O
mostly O
for O
oline O
classes O
. O

Even O
with O
virus B-AS
protection I-AS
, O
it O
always O
turned O
off O
when O
updates B-AS
were O
needed O
and O
installed O
. O

Also O
consider O
the O
MS B-AS
Office I-AS
apps I-AS
are O
all O
trial O
versions O
, O
hope O
you O
have O
your O
own O
copies O
. O

They O
are O
wonderful O
, O
but O
very O
dangerous O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
emitting O
heat O
. O

This O
computer O
was O
awful O
! O

Heck O
, O
if O
I O
had O
enough O
money O
, O
I O
would O
but O
it O
as O
a O
gift O
for O
someone O
. O

Even O
so O
, O
I O
like O
playing O
online O
games B-AS
, O
so O
it O
was O
wonderful O
that O
there O
is O
a O
feature B-AS
where O
I O
can O
dualboot O
Windows B-AS
. O

The O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
is O
amazingly O
long O
at O
7hrs O
and O
5hrs O
if O
you O
use O
it O
. O

My O
previous O
purchases O
were O
with O
Dell O
and O
HP O
. O

I O
have O
not O
have O
any O
problems O
. O

I O
purchased O
an O
HP O
right O
after O
my O
high O
school O
graduation O
. O

Me O
and O
my O
boyfriend O
bought O
the O
Gateway O
NV78 O
in O
nov O
of O
09 O
. O

It O
is O
very O
user O
friendly O
and O
not O
hard O
to O
figure O
out O
at O
all O
. O

lightweight O
, O
long O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
, O
excellent O
transition O
from O
PC O
; O

The O
price B-AS
is O
another O
driving O
influence O
that O
made O
me O
purchase O
this O
laptop O
. O

The O
Nortons B-AS
virus I-AS
scan I-AS
is O
only O
for O
a O
very O
short O
time O
unlike O
others O
that O
usually O
are O
good O
for O
a O
year O
. O

It O
is O
stamped O
and O
not O
in O
pieces O
therefore O
it O
is O
a O
stronger O
more O
resilient O
frame B-AS
. O

I O
am O
first O
time O
Mac O
Buyer O
and O
am O
amazed O
at O
features B-AS
and O
ease O
of O
use B-AS
the O
Mac O
offers O
. O

Two O
, O
owning O
a O
17 O
inmac O
book O
gives O
the O
flexibility O
to O
sit O
anywhere O
you O
want O
without O
worry O
about O
bother O
anyone O
. O

Sent O
unit O
back O
and O
it O
's O
been O
two O
months O
. O

Came O
fully O
loaded B-AS
, O
good O
. O

I O
noticed O
windows B-AS
has O
a O
new O
system O
called O
Windows B-AS
7 I-AS
, O
what O
about O
us O
Vista B-AS
users O
? O
They O
should O
get O
all O
the O
bugs O
out O
of O
Vista B-AS
before O
investing O
in O
a O
new O
system O
. O

When O
we O
bought O
our O
new O
HP O
comouter O
in O
Dec O
of O
2008 O
, O
we O
wanted O
Windows O
XP O
, O
but O
were O
told O
it O
would O
cost O
an O
extra O
$ O
159 O
, O
so O
we O
went O
with O
Vista B-AS
. O

I O
definatly O
ca O
n't O
. O

Files O
as O
well O
would O
become O
lost O
, O
deleted O
or O
corrupted O
. O

It O
is O
meant O
to O
be O
PORTABLE O
. O

My O
laptop O
worked O
again O
for O
just O
a O
while O
before O
I O
started O
having O
issues O
AGAIN O
. O

This O
is O
perfect O
for O
her O
field O
. O

taking O
it O
back O
less O
than O
24 O
hours O
of O
purchase O

That O
's O
the O
downside O
for O
me O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
I O
have O
, O
is O
the O
key B-AS
broad I-AS
is O
a O
little O
dark O
to O
see O
the O
letters O
, O
would O
help O
if O
it O
was O
a O
little O
lighter O
then O
it O
is O
. O

Hopefully O
Amazon O
will O
take O
this O
back O
. O

They O
ended O
up O
keeping O
my O
computer O
for O
almost O
3 O
months O
! O

I O
' O
m O
still O
within O
the O
one O
year O
warranty B-AS
but O
the O
repair B-AS
" I-AS
depot I-AS
" I-AS
has O
deemed O
that O
this O
time O
it O
was O
caused O
by O
physical O
abuse O
and O
is O
not O
covered O
. O

But O
I O
needed O
a O
laptop O
for O
school B-AS
use I-AS
. O

he O
ca O
n't O
stand O
it O
. O

The O
computer O
was O
delivered O
as O
promised O
. O

This O
is O
the O
complete O
opposite O
to O
an O
ergonomic O
design B-AS
. O

I O
would O
like O
at O
least O
a O
4 O
hr O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
. O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
I O
do O
n't O
like O
about O
my O
mac O
is O
that O
sometimes O
there O
are O
programs B-AS
that O
I O
want O
to O
be O
able O
to O
run O
and O
I O
am O
not O
able O
to O
. O

Looking O
online O
, O
many O
people O
are O
having O
the O
same O
problem O
. O

Wireless B-AS
has O
not O
been O
a O
issue O
for O
me O
, O
like O
some O
others O
have O
meantioned O
. O

THIS O
IS O
MY O
SECOND O
MAC O
BOOK O
PRO O
. O

MacBook O
Notebooks O
quickly O
die O
out O
because O
of O
their O
short O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
many O
background O
programs B-AS
that O
run O
without O
the O
user O
's O
knowlede O
. O

All O
the O
things O
you O
can O
do O
with O
the O
trackpad B-AS
make O
navigating B-AS
around O
the O
computer O
and O
its O
programs B-AS
so O
much O
simpler O
, O
quicker O
, O
and O
easier O
. O

I O
guess O
the O
only O
good O
thing O
that O
came O
out O
of O
these O
were O
the O
speakers B-AS
and O
the O
subwoofer B-AS
. O

There O
s O
a O
built B-AS
in I-AS
camera I-AS
with O
special O
effects O
for O
video O
and O
photography O
. O

All O
for O
such O
a O
great O
price B-AS
. O

I O
went O
right O
out O
and O
purchased O
another O
laptop O
. O

Long O
story O
short O
, O
since O
I O
experience O
so O
many O
problems O
with O
my O
laptop O
every O
since O
I O
bought O
it O
from O
day O
one O
, O
I O
did O
n't O
ask O
for O
a O
new O
laptop O
or O
a O
refund O
of O
what O
I O
pay O
for O
a O
crapy O
laptop O
, O
but O
just O
an O
extension O
of O
my O
laptop O
warranty B-AS
for O
another O
year O
, O
they O
made O
a O
big O
deal O
of O
out O
that O
and O
after O
so O
many O
calls O
and O
complaints O
about O
their O
products O
and O
services O
, O
they O
finally O
gave O
in O
. O

I O
am O
able O
to O
play O
720p O
and O
1080p O
media O
files O
just O
fine O
with O
it O
. O

I O
already O
own O
an O
iPhone O
, O
and O
so O
the O
move O
just O
made O
more O
sense O
. O

So O
think O
about O
factoring O
those O
things O
in O
when O
you O
purchase O
. O

Took O
the O
netbook O
on O
a O
vacation O
trip O
and O
I O
was O
able O
to O
do O
whatever O
I O
wanted O
to O
do O
without O
lugging O
a O
much O
heavier O
laptop O
. O

Everything O
was O
up O
and O
running O
within O
15 O
minutes O
of O
unboxing O
. O

This O
computer O
gets O
very O
hot O
, O
before O
shutting O
down O
. O

Another O
thing O
is O
that O
after O
only O
a O
month O
the O
left B-AS
mouse I-AS
key I-AS
broke O
and O
it O
costed B-AS
$ O
175 O
to O
send O
it O
in O
to O
fix O
it O
. O

Went O
silently O
. O

Satisfy O
what O
I O
paid O
for O
it O
. O

IT O
IS O
TRASH O
! O

It O
has O
good O
speed B-AS
and O
plenty O
of O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
space I-AS
. O

Clear O
picture B-AS
on O
it O
and O
everything O
. O

Overall O
though O
, O
for O
the O
money O
spent O
it O
's O
a O
great O
deal O
. O

So O
you O
do O
n't O
get O
frustrated O
the O
first O
few O
weeks O
. O

They O
said O
that O
my O
computer O
was O
covered O
on O
an O
extended B-AS
warranty I-AS
, O
and O
that O
products O
with O
extended B-AS
warranties I-AS
are O
taken O
care O
of O
through O
third O
parties O
and O
not O
Sony O
itself O
anymore O
. O

It O
's O
so O
useable O
and O
responsive O
. O

It O
is O
truly O
a O
Desktop O
Replacement O
. O

I O
only O
used O
it O
to O
browse O
the O
internet O
and O
and O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
many O
times O
it O
has O
spontaniously O
shut O
down O
and O
it O
is O
just O
a O
blank O
screen O
now O
. O

A O
little O
pricey O
but O
it O
is O
well O
, O
well O
worth O
it O
. O

Very O
long O
- O
life O
battery B-AS
up O
to O
10 O
- O
11 O
hours O
depending O
on O
how O
you O
configure O
power O
level O
settings O
. O

Screen B-AS
is O
awesome O
, O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
is O
good O
. O

The O
black O
model O
also O
has O
a O
very O
nice O
seamless O
appearance B-AS
, O
one O
of O
the O
better O
looking O
notebooks O
I O
' O
ve O
seen O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
it O
was O
not O
as O
user O
friendly O
as O
I O
expected O
either O
. O

The O
technical B-AS
service I-AS
for I-AS
dell I-AS
is O
so O
3rd O
world O
it O
might O
as O
well O
not O
even O
bother O
. O

The O
graphics B-AS
were O
awful O
and O
the O
warranty B-AS
is O
n't O
even O
worth O
the O
cheap O
payment O
on O
the O
computer O
. O

and O
if O
u O
did O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
had O
the O
MacBook O
Pro O
15 O
for O
about O
three O
weeks O
, O
and O
it O
really O
is O
a O
great O
computer O
. O

They O
gave O
me O
a O
hard O
time O
yet O
again O
, O
but O
their O
was O
a O
malfunction O
in O
the O
battery B-AS
itself O
, O
it O
did O
n't O
die O
. O

It O
was O
definelty O
a O
smart O
move O
. O

I O
' O
m O
excited O
to O
learn O
more O
about O
what O
this O
powerful O
machine O
has O
to O
offer O
and O
encourage O
others O
to O
do O
the O
same O
. O

Apparently O
they O
are O
defective O
since O
they O
are O
not O
securely O
attached O
. O

but O
other O
then O
that O
I O
would O
give O
this O
product O
a O
4 O
in O
hafe O
stars O
. O

Sure O
hope O
Best O
Buy O
will O
replace O
it O
asap O
. O

I O
babyed O
the O
heck O
out O
of O
it O
and O
i O
still O
do O
. O

Handles O
all O
my O
basic O
media O
needs O
easily O
. O

Just O
what O
the O
doctor O
ordered O
. O

If O
you O
do O
n't O
feel O
comfortable O
doing O
it O
yourself O
, O
just O
buy O
the O
case B-AS
and O
be O
happy O
, O
plus O
it O
looks O
nice O
, O
I O
bought O
the O
white O
one O
from O
Best O
Buy O
. O

The O
reaction O
of O
Toshiba O
is O
there O
is O
nothing O
you O
can O
do O
about O
it O
so O
just O
sit O
back O
and O
except O
the O
fact O
that O
you O
are O
powerless O
and O
it O
is O
mind O
over O
matter O
. O

you O
can O
find O
many O
laptops O
with O
the O
same O
performance B-AS
and O
even O
better O
with O
lower O
price B-AS
, O
but O
you O
can O
not O
find O
the O
look B-AS
, O
easy O
, O
applications B-AS
, O
and O
the O
experience O
in O
mac O
. O

Excellent O
speed B-AS
for O
processing O
data O
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
I O
' O
m O
incredibly O
dissatisfied O
with O
this O
laptop O
, O
and O
with O
HP O
as O
a O
whole O
. O

I O
am O
not O
happy O
at O
all O
with O
the O
product O
I O
purchased O
. O

When O
you O
call O
tech B-AS
support I-AS
you O
were O
routed O
to O
someone O
who O
was O
in O
another O
country O
and O
did O
not O
know O
what O
they O
were O
doing O
. O

It O
has O
come O
into O
good O
use B-AS
for O
my O
finances O
, O
scheduling O
, O
my O
parents O
business O
expenses O
, O
and O
it O
is O
definitely O
amazing O
for O
gaming B-AS
. O

I O
was O
taught O
to O
use O
Photoshop B-AS
and O
was O
amazed O
. O

It O
's O
A O
MAC O
! O
! O

It O
was O
weird O
. O

I O
can O
hardly O
wait O
to O
see O
what O
s O
around O
the O
next O
corner O
. O

the O
apple O
pro O
notebook O
will O
not O
let O
you O
down O
. O

I O
did O
a O
review O
on O
it O
, O
its O
awesome O
. O

Before O
we O
got O
this O
laptop O
, O
had O
a O
compaq O
pasaro O
for O
5 O
years O
with O
no O
problems O
. O

I O
tried O
out O
another O
Mac O
for O
a O
few O
months O
before O
buying O
this O
one O
and O
it O
is O
a O
great O
machine O
. O

Somehow O
the O
system B-AS
clock I-AS
got O
messed O
up O
after O
reboot O
. O

the O
only O
problem O
is O
that O
i O
had O
to O
add O
1 O
gb O
RAM B-AS
, O
the O
computer O
was O
kinda O
slow O
. O

With O
the O
macbook O
pro O
it O
comes O
with O
freeASPECT0 O
to O
protect O
it O
from O
viruses O
and O
other O
intrusive O
things O
from O
downloads O
and O
internet O
surfing O
or O
emails O
. O

The O
computer O
could O
have O
been O
shipped O
by O
Priority O
Mail O
through O
the O
USPS O
for O
the O
same O
cost O
and O
arrived O
by O
Noon O
on O
Tue O
. O

I O
visited O
the O
Apple O
Store O
and O
was O
impressed O
with O
the O
17-inch O
MacBook O
Pro O
. O

The O
driver B-AS
updates I-AS
do O
n't O
fix O
the O
issue O
, O
very O
frustrating O
. O

I O
will O
never O
go O
back O
to O
Windows B-AS
! O

Do O
your O
research O
on O
this O
issue O
. O

Looking O
to O
take O
my O
video O
and O
photo O
editing O
to O
the O
next O
level O
, O
I O
decided O
to O
purchase O
the O
MBP O

in O
Intel O
Core O
i5 O
after O
reading O
consumer O
reviews O
as O
well O
as O
professional O
reviews O
of O
this O
laptop O
. O

It O
does O
nt O

When O
I O
first O

The O

apple O

one O
of O
the O
best O

companies O
in O

. O

PLEASE O
MAKE O
THESE O
! O

Frustrated O
I O
hung O
up O
and O
tried O
to O
call O
back O
3 O
days O
later O
to O
be O
told O
that O
it O
takes O
2 O
- O
3 O
days O
for O
turnaround O
time O
. O

After O
the O
first O
few O
months O
, O
the O
computer O
started O
crashing O
about O
every O
week O
. O

My O
son O
and O
his O
family O
have O
a O
hard O
time O
financially O
because O
he O
is O
self O
- O
employed O
so O
the O
family O
had O
no O
computer O
of O
any O
kind O
, O
and O
kyle O
the O
oldest O
child O
is O
12 O
and O
really O
need O
something O
to O
help O
him O
in O
school O
. O

It O
's O
a O
great O
product O
for O
a O
great O
price B-AS
! O

Again O
, O
the O
same O
problem O
, O
the O
right B-AS
speaker I-AS
did O
not O
work O
. O

But O
see O
the O
macbook O
pro O
is O
different O
because O
it O
may O
have O
a O
huge O
price O
tag O
but O
it O
comes O
with O
the O
full O
software B-AS
that O
you O
would O
actually O
need O
and O
most O
of O
it O
has O
free O
future O
updates B-AS
. O

Before O
i O
bought O
my O
new O
i5 O
, O
I O
did O
my O
research O
for O
about O
2 O
weeks O
and O
determined O
to O
move O
for O
HP O
to O
Apple O
for O
reliability O
, O
dependable O
, O
and O
long O
lasting O
operations O
. O

Dell O
wanted O
to O
charge O
us O
for O
everything O
everytime O
I O
called O
them O
with O
a O
problem O
. O

THIS O
HAS O
BEEN O
NOTHING O
BUT O
A O
HEADACHE O
SINCE O
WE O
PURCHASED O
IT O
. O

i O
have O
had O
my O
dell O
latitude O
for O
almost O
three O
years O
. O

May O
be O
better O
for O
the O
occasional O
web O
surfer O
. O

and O
the O
multiple B-AS
page I-AS
viewer I-AS
allows O
you O
to O
press O
one O
button O
to O
see O
every O
separate O
page O
currently O
opened O
at O
the O
same O
time O
in O
one O
screen O
are O
great O
for O
those O
who O
are O
working O
non O
stop O
or O
just O
shopping O
online O
. O

This O
was O
the O
3rd O
day O
and O
part O
still O
had O
not O
been O
shipped B-AS
. O

Obviously O
we O
both O
got O
new O
Macs O
. O

My O
Iphone O
synced O
right O
up O
just O
like O
a O
person O
would O
expect O
, O
unlike O
the O
PCs O
in O
our O
lives O
. O

That O
being O
said O
after O
2 O
weeks O
of O
owning O
every O
time O
I O
start O
it O
up O
now O
it O
gives O
me O
a O
black O
screen O
for O
5 O
- O
8 O
seconds O
stating O
pxe O
- O
e61 O
media O
test O
error O
check O
cable O
. O

It O
's O
fun O
to O
take O
to O
a O
bookstore O
, O
sit O
in O
the O
coffee O
shop O
area O
, O
sign O
in O
to O
WiFi O
and O
look O
up O
book O
reviews O
of O
books O
I O
might O
buy O
. O

Not O
super O
fancy O
, O
but O
not O
super O
expensive O
either O
. O

Keyboard B-AS
good O
sized O
and O
wasy O
to O
use B-AS
. O

HP O
said O
it O
was O
out O
of O
warranty B-AS
. O

-Stay O
away O
from O
Apple O
, O
or O
hope O
you O
laptop O
does O
not O
break O
down O
. O

It O
's O
a O
great O
prodcut O
to O
handle O
basic O
computing O
needs O
. O

I O
never O
had O
this O
kind O
of O
quality B-AS
issue O
with O
Dell O
not O
to O
say O
Dell O
is O
that O
great O
, O
not O
with O
a O
brand O
new O
laptop O
. O

wonderful O
features B-AS
. O

the O
laptop O
was O
really O
good O
and O
it O
goes O
really O
fast O
just O
the O
way O
i O
thought O
it O
would O
of O
run O
. O

I O
had O
to O
call O
HP O
and O
ask O
for O
a O
recovery B-AS
disk I-AS
because O
the O
computer O
does O
not O
come O
with O
one O
and O
completely O
redo O
it O
all O
. O

I O
m O
glad O
that O
it O
has O
such O
great O
features B-AS
in O
it O
. O

it O
's O
just O
a O
great O
toy O
to O
have O
around O
. O

I O
like O
those O
programs B-AS
better O
than O
Office B-AS
and O
you O
can O
save O
your O
files O
to O
be O
completely O
compatible O
with O
the O
Office B-AS
programs I-AS
as O
well O
. O

Great O
wifi B-AS
too O
. O

WHEN O
TYPING B-AS
, O
LETTERS O
AND O
SPACES O
ARE O
FREQUENTLY O
OMITTED O
REQUIRING O
THE O
USER O
TO O
REDO O
MANY O
WORDS O
AND O
SENTENCES O
. O

Only O
a O
few O
days O
after O
I O
received O
the O
computer O
back O
, O
the O
screen B-AS
froze O
again O
. O

It O
is O
not O
ideal O
for O
children O
because O
of O
the O
temp B-AS
. O

sounds O
like O
a O
typewriter O
, O
but O
if O
you O
can O
get O
past O
that O
, O
this O
is O
a O
great O
laptop O
for O
a O
little O
money O
! O

When O
this O
happened O
I O
would O
have O
to O
completely O
power O
off O
my O
computer O
and O
restart O
it O
. O

Although O
i O
do O
believe O
that O
Windows B-AS
operating I-AS
system I-AS
may O
be O
to O
fault O
for O
some O
of O
the O
problems O
. O

Great O
OS B-AS
, O
fabulous O
improvements O
to O
the O
existing O
line O
bumping O
up O
the O
processor B-AS
speed I-AS
and O
adding O
the O
thunderbolt B-AS
port I-AS
. O

I O
or O
my O
dad O
paid O
over O
twenty O
four O
hundred O
dollars O
for O
everything O
. O

The O
lcd B-AS
screen I-AS
stopped O
working O
on O
mine O
after O
10 O
months O
. O

That O
includes O
transferring O
my O
music O
and O
movies O
. O

Images B-AS
are O
crisp O
and O
clean O
. O

Took O
that O
one O
home O
, O
same O
thing O
. O

I O
' O
m O
going O
back O
to O
PC O
. O

Great O
, O
quick O
laptop O
for O
the O
money O
. O

although O
its O
windows B-AS
vista I-AS
compared O
to O
windows B-AS
xp I-AS
sucks O
. O

We O
have O
had O
numerous O
problems O
with O
Vista B-AS
, O
such O
as O
Adobe B-AS
Flash I-AS
player I-AS
just O
quits O
and O
has O
to O
be O
uninstalled O
and O
then O
reinsalled O
, O
Internet B-AS
Explore I-AS
just O
quits O
and O
you O
lose O
whatever O
you O
were O
working O
on O
, O
also O
, O
the O
same O
Windows B-AS
update I-AS
has O
appeared O
on O
this O
computer O
since O
we O
got O
it O
and O
has O
been O
update B-AS
probably O
400 O
times O
, O
the O
same O
update B-AS
. O

The O
Dell O
mini O
was O
the O
first O
Dell O
product O
that O
I O
had O
ever O
purchased O
. O

with O
the O
switch B-AS
being O
at O
the O
top O
you O
need O
to O
memorize O
the O
key O
combination O
rather O
than O
just O
flicking O
a O
switch B-AS
. O

My O
Mac O
has O
gone O
from O
being O
a O
trusted O
friend O
to O
an O
adversary O
. O

One O
more O
tip O
, O
please O
purchase O
this O
model O
and O
get O
a O
4 B-AS
GB I-AS
stick I-AS
of I-AS

By O
week O
two O
, O
my O
laptop O
had O
overheated O
and O
was O
completely O
dead O
even O
though O
I O
did O
not O
use O
it O
too O
much O
. O

And O
it O
is O
impossible O
to O
get O
them O
back O
in O
. O

My O
last O
laptop O
gave O
me O
a O
constant O
battle O
even O
though O
it O
was O
also O
completely O
new O
. O

I O
have O
been O
a O
mac O
user O
since O
the O
mid O
90s O
. O

It O
has O
bein O
into O
the O
shop O
to O
get O
a O
new O
hardrive B-AS
2 O
times O
and O
to O
fix O
the O
touch B-AS
control I-AS
buttons I-AS
on O
the O
keyboard B-AS
! O

After O
the O
bad O
experience O
with O
this O
computer O
went O
back O
to O
compaq O
. O

Finally O
after O
months O
of O
research O
the O
discovered O
that O
they O
mailed O
it O
to O
a O
Walmart O
and O
there O
probably O
would O
be O
no O
way O
to O
find O
the O
box O
. O

It O
does O
n't O
heat O
up O
like O
my O
old O
laptop O
. O

I O
always O
have O
used O
a O
tower O
home O
PC O
and O
jumped O
to O
the O
laptop O
and O
have O
been O
very O
satisfied O
with O
its O
performance B-AS
. O

It O
's O
solid O
. O

Before O
I O
got O
my O
macbook O
, O
I O
owned O
a O
Dell O
laptop O
. O

This O
laptop O
is O
the O
most O
amazing O
little O
peice O
of O
machinery O
I O
have O
owned O
outside O
of O
the O
Iphone O
. O

The O
computer O
runs B-AS
very O
fast O
with O
no O
problems O
and O
the O
iLife B-AS
software I-AS
that O
comes O
with O
it O
iPhoto B-AS
, O
iMovie B-AS
, O
iWeb B-AS
, O
iTunes B-AS
, O
GarageBand B-AS
is O
all O
very O
helpful O
as O
well O
. O

At O
first O
it O
worked O
well O
for O
a O
month O
or O
so O
then O
the O
system B-AS
board I-AS
failed O
and O
I O
send O
it O
in O
to O
toshiba O
some O
complaints O
and O
three O
weeks O
later O
I O
then O
receive O
my O
laptop O
back O
only O
to O
discover O
that O
it O
still O
has O
the O
same O
problem O
so O
now O
I O
have O
to O
send O
it O
back O
again O
to O
get O
it O
fixed O
again O
. O

Until O
I O
bought O
the O
Dell O
, O
I O
thought O
you O
just O
looked O
for O
what O
you O
wanted O
size B-AS
, O
software B-AS
, O
options O
, O
hardware B-AS
and O
purchase O
the O
best O
deal O
you O
could O
find O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
I O
could O
ever O
live O
without O
my O
Qousmio O
. O

It O
has O
plenty O
of O
memory B-AS
, O
lots O
of O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
, O
and O
great O
graphics B-AS
. O

It O
did O
n't O
take O
me O
long O
to O
get O
switched O
over O
to O
the O
Mac O
computer O
programs B-AS
and O
navigation B-AS
, O
it O
's O
been O
just O
fine O
and O
like O
the O
way O
this O
laptop O
functions O
much O
better O
. O

It O
lasted O
for O
many O
years O
of O
travel O
, O
kids O
and O
abuse O
and O
if O
I O
fired O
it O
up O
today O
, O
it O
would O
work O
. O

been O
a O
PC O
user O
for O
many O
, O
many O
years O
. O

I O
have O
never O
had O
any O
issues O
or O
problems O
with O
my O
MacBook O
Pro O
so O
far O
, O
and O
it O
is O
still O
as O
fast O
as O
it O
was O
when O
I O
first O
bought O
it O
. O

It O
freezes O
, O
and O
it O
always O
shows O
that O
there O
is O
an O
error O
, O
so O
I O
have O
to O
restart O
it O
a O
few O
times O
every O
time O
I O
use O
it O
. O

However O
, O
my O
girlfriend O
realized O
that O
the O
netbook O
's O
hinge B-AS
is O
a O
bit O
loose O
when O
you O
open O
or O
close O
the O
LCD B-AS
. O

My O
problem O
was O
with O
DELL B-AS
Customer I-AS
Service I-AS
. O

There O
are O
so O
many O
things O
wrong O
with O
this O
product O
, O
it O
just O
makes O
me O
want O
to O
set O
my O
self O
on O
fire O
! O

It O
is O
not O
even O
a O
year O
old O
yet O
, O
so O
I O
would O
definitely O
not O
recommend O
it O
to O
anyone O
. O

Amazing O
machine O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
do O
any O
high O
tech O
stuff O
on O
it O
, O
just O
write O
papers O
, O
check O
mail O
, O
and O
sometimes O
play O
games O
, O
so O
I O
ca O
n't O
reccomend O
it O
if O
you O
are O
in O
the O
computer O
field O
. O

Newegg O
's O
RMA B-AS
service I-AS
was O
great O
as O
always O
, O
I O
contacted O
them O
late O
Friday O
night O

me O
an O
RMA O

I O
' O
m O
very O
impressed O
. O

Dell O
sucks O

Design B-AS
, O
very O
durable O
. O

It O
is O
easy O
to O
go O
from O
one O

to O
another O

I O
spoke O
to O
4 O

MSN B-AS
Messenger I-AS
and O
a O
few O
other O

constantly O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

I O
have O
owned O
many O
computers O
and O
laptops O
. O

I O
recently O
purchased O
the O
mini O
and O
absolutely O
love O
it O
! O

Does O
a O
great O
job O
with O
video O
shot O
on O
a O
Canon O
5D O
MKII O
. O

I O
was O
told O
by O
many O
that O
it O
was O
a O
great O
computer O
, O
but O
we O
got O
one O
of O
these O
, O
and O
it O
worked O
great O
for O
one O
year O
, O
and O
as O
soon O
as O
the O
warrenty B-AS
was O
up O
, O
then O
it O
got O
really O
bad O
. O

I O
ve O
had O
to O
call O
tech B-AS
support I-AS
many O
times O
. O

The O
Apple B-AS
applications I-AS
exASPECT1 O
are O
fun O
, O
easy O
, O
and O
really O
cool O
to O
use O
unlike O
the O
competition O
! O
. O

Yes O
, O
I O
have O
it O
on O
the O
highest O
available O
setting O
. O

Not O
to O
mention O
it O
has O
shit O
gigs B-AS
. O

Hieroglyphics O
are O
quite O
common O
. O

This O
worked O
just O
fine O
. O

I O
paid O
for O
extra O
memory B-AS
and O
the O
17-inch B-AS
screen I-AS
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
top O
of O
the O
line O
DVD B-AS
and O
CD B-AS
burners I-AS
. O

Its O
pretty O
fast O
and O
does O
not O
have O
hiccups O
while O
I O
am O
using O
it O
for O
web B-AS
browsing I-AS
, O
uploading B-AS
photos I-AS
, O
watching B-AS
movies I-AS
720p O
on O
occasion O
and O
creating B-AS
presentations I-AS
. O

I O
was O
so O
happy O
with O
my O
new O
Mac O
. O

Quality B-AS
Display I-AS
I O
love O
HP O
, O
, O
it O
's O
the O
only O
computer O
/ O
printer O
we O
will O
buy O
. O

Despite O
the O
inconvenient O
weight O
, O
I O
opted O
for O
the O
12 B-AS
cell I-AS
battery I-AS
. O

My O
MacBook O
is O
faster O
than O
any O
comparable O
PC O
. O

The O
case B-AS
is O
carved O
out O
of O
a O
single O
block O
of O
aluminum O
. O

I O
' O
m O
very O
happy O
with O
this O
machine O
! O

I O
do O
not O
recommend O
this O
company O
or O
their O
products O
! O
! O
! O
! O

I O
like O
this O
machine O
because O
its O
very O
lightweight O
. O

First O
it O
burned O
or O
fused O
the O
power B-AS
adapter I-AS
plug I-AS
. O

the O
features B-AS
are O
great O
, O
the O
only O
thing O
it O
needs O
is O
better O
speakers B-AS
. O

It O
was O
still O
working O
, O
but O
there O
was O
nothing O
on O
the O
screen B-AS
. O

I O
bought O
this O
laptop O
and O
found O
its O
TAB B-AS
is O
not O
functioning O
. O

Toshiba O
is O
aware O
of O
the O
issue O
but O
unless O
the O
extended B-AS
warrenty I-AS
is O
bought O
Toshiba O
will O
do O
nothing O
about O
it O
. O

HP O
said O
I O
had O
done O
the O
damage O
. O

-Called O
headquarters O
again O
, O
they O
report O
that O
TFT B-AS
panel I-AS
is O
broken O
, O
should O
be O
fixed O
by O
the O
end O
of O
the O
week O
week O
3 O
. O

Navigation B-AS
through O
the O
computer O
is O
far O
superior O
compared O
to O
Windows B-AS
operating I-AS
systems I-AS
, O
as O
well O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
this O
product O
. O

If O
I O
had O
to O
buy O
another O
computer O
, O
I O
would O
most O
definetly O
buy O
an O
acer O
one O
computer O
. O

The O
screen B-AS
is O
framed O
by O
half O
to O
a O
full O
- O
inch O
margin O
that O
is O
obviously O
unnecessary O
, O
reduces O
the O
screen B-AS
size O
and O
increases O
the O
bulk B-AS
. O

Though O
the O
picture B-AS
, O
video B-AS
, O
and O
music B-AS
software I-AS
is O
nowhere O
close O
to O
professional O
grade O
software B-AS
I O
m O
used O
to O
CS5 O
but O
does O
the O
job O
for O
beginner O
and O
even O
intermediate O
media O
designers O
. O

I O
previously O
owned O
an O
HP O
desktop O
and O
a O
Dell O
laptop O
. O

Everything O
else O
just O
install O
and O
go O
. O

This O
thing O
is O
a O
lemon O
. O

My O
laptop O
is O
almost O
2yrs O
old O
and O
I O
have O
never O
had O
any O
problems O
with O
it O
. O

All O
the O
customers O
that O
come O
in O
hate O
Dell O
. O

We O
now O
own O
two O
of O
these O
, O
identical O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
already O
recommended O
this O
laptop O
to O
a O
friend O
who O
eye O
'd O
the O
computer O
when O
I O
took O
it O
out O
of O
my O
bag O
. O

I O
enjoy O
very O
much O
my O
new O
Toshiba O
, O
purchased O
specifially O
for O
attending O
online O
schooling O
. O

Once O
you O
go O
Mac O
, O
you O
ca O
n't O
go O
back O
! O

I O
brought O
this O
laptop O
last O
friday O
, O
and O
originally O
it O
worked O
fantastic O
. O

The O
much O
lauded O
combined B-AS
touch I-AS
pad I-AS
and I-AS
clicker I-AS
is O
a O
nightmare O
. O

The O
Unibody B-AS
construction I-AS
is O
solid O
, O
sleek O
and O
beautiful O
. O

They O
're O
easy O
, O
fun O
, O
powerful O
and O
will O
last O
a O
long O
time O
. O

I O
WANT O
MY O
L505-s5988 O
BACK O
! O

I O
let O
my O
friend O
borrow O
it O
, O
and O
she O
knows O
nothing O
about O
computers O
, O
and O
she O
used O
it O
with O
ease O
. O

This O
MacBook O
is O
an O
outstanding O
product O
with O
great O
value B-AS
. O

If O
that O
is O
the O
case O
for O
you O
, O
I O
would O
suggest O
a O
pull O
- O
behind O
solution O
when O
looking O
at O
cases O
. O

I O
had O
to O
re O
- O
install O
Windows B-AS
within O
two O
weeks O
of O
the O
purchase O
and O
soon O
discovered O
cracks O
in O
the O
screen B-AS
hinges I-AS
. O

A O
SECOND O
PROBLEM O
INVOLVES O
THE O
BATTERY B-AS
WHICH O
IS O
ADVERTISED O
AS O
HAVING O
A O
STORAGE O
LIFE O
OF O
11 O
HOURS O
BUT O
WHEN O
FULLY O
CHARGED O
SHOWS O
ONLY O
7 O
HOURS O
OF O
SERVICE B-AS
. O

and O
plenty O
of O
storage B-AS
with O
250 O
gbthough O
I O
will O
upgrade O
this O
and O
the O
ram B-AS
. O

I O
had O
to O
call O
Apple O
19 O
times O
each O
time O
40 O
to O
75 O
minutes O
on O
the O
phone O
, O
and O
take O
it O
to O
their O
store O
for O
evaluations O
, O
and O
diagnostics O
, O
5 O
times O
. O

No O
temporary O
replacement O
, O
they O
are O
out O
of O
replacements O
because O
many O
computers O
had O
problems O
with O
the O
Nvidia B-AS
chipset I-AS
status O
of O
repair O
. O

I O
took O
it O
to O
friend O
who O
temporarily O
fixed O
it O
and O
I O
finally O
paid O
about O
1500 O
for O
the O
extended B-AS
warranty I-AS
. O

I O
respond O
that O
I O
do O
not O
have O
the O
old O
computer O
. O

I O
homeschool O
my O
kids O
and O
with O
this O
netbook O
next O
to O
my O
desk O
we O
get O
to O
teaching O
and O
illustrating O
without O
skipping O
a O
beat O
. O

Programs B-AS
would O
crash O
all O
the O
time O
, O
and O
it O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
a O
very O
unstable O
, O
unreliable O
laptop O
for O
me O
. O

I O
BOUGHT O
THIS O
LAP O
TOP O
AND O
THE O
CHARGE B-AS
TIME I-AS
DOSE O
N'T O
LAST O
AS O
LONG O
AS O
THEY O
SAY O
IT O
WILL O
MORE O
LIKE O
2 O
HOURS O

Also O
, O
because O
of O
the O
size B-AS
and O
consistancy B-AS
of O
the O
laptop O
computer O
, O
some O
websites O
would O
n't O
even O
attempt O
to O
work O
on O
the O
computer O
because O
of O
browser O
problems O
. O

I O
work O
with O
kids O
and O
they O
love O
making O
short O
videos O
on O
there O
. O

It O
is O
very O
durable O
, O
I O
am O
pretty O
rough O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
electronics O
and O
it O
has O
taken O
it O
all O
with O
no O
reprecutions O
yet O
. O

the O
key B-AS
bindings I-AS
take O
a O
little O
getting O
used O
to O
, O
but O
have O
loved O
the O
Macbook O
Pro O
. O

Keyboard B-AS
is O
reasonable O
size B-AS
. O

Instead O
it O
is O
sitting O
in O
West O
Verginia O
waiting O
for O
UPS O
to O
take O
two O
days O
to O
send O
Me O
a O
box O
and O
Two O
days O
for O
them O
to O
ship O
the O
computer O
some O
691 O
miles O
by O
air O
? O
to O
Louisville O
Ky O
. O

I O
' O
m O
now O
trying O
to O
decide O
on O
another O
Dell O
model O
. O

I O
find O
myself O
using O
the O
10-key B-AS
more O
than O
I O
thought O
I O
would O
. O

The O
Macbook O
is O
a O
fantastic O
laptop O
. O

Fan B-AS
noise O
, O
The O
fan B-AS
made O
a O
constant O
hissing O
noise O
in O
the O
background O
. O

I O
believe O
this O
is O
because O
I O
was O
more O
active O
than O
the O
average O
user O
, O
meaning O
I O
average O
about O
three O
tabs O
. O

Best O
Buy O
Rocks O
! O

A O
couple O
things O
you O
should O
know O
, O

bought O
the O
first O
asus O
laptop O
in O
san O
francisco O
, O
returned O
it O
in O
santa O
maria O
, O
thinking O
it O
was O
just O
a O
problem O
with O
that O
computer O
. O

The O
screen B-AS
is O
bright O
and O
clear O
, O
the O
operating B-AS
system I-AS
is O
solid O
and O
friendly O
to O
a O
novice O
. O

It O
has O
a O
1 O
ghz O
faster O
processor B-AS
and O
a O
stock O
500 B-AS
gb I-AS
hard I-AS
drive I-AS
. O

The O
feature B-AS
are O
good O
enough O
for O
what O
I O
need O
. O

All O
the O
yada O
- O
yada O
. O

Finally O
, O
the O
biggest O
problem O
has O
been O
tech B-AS
support I-AS
. O

this O
laptop O
is O
great O
for O
work O
and O
doing O
my O
pictures O
. O

I O
had O
the O
computer O
for O
a O
full O
year O
and O
it O
was O
a O
new O
computer O
. O

This O
is O
n't O
a O
big O
deal O
, O
I O
have O
n't O
noticed O
the O
issue O
with O
DVDs O
or O
other O
media O
, O
only O
through O
USB B-AS
output I-AS
. O

I O
love O
it O
! O

With O
Windows O
laptops O
a O
wireless B-AS
mouse I-AS
is O
an O
absolute O
must O
. O

I O
had O
been O
a O
Windows B-AS
user O
before O
this O
I O
love O
the O
size B-AS
because O
the O
screen B-AS
is O
big O
enough O
for O
what O
I O
use O
it O
for O
Internet O
, O
artwork O
, O
and O
yet O
it O
is O
small O
enough O
to O
be O
reasonably O
portable O
. O

But O
if O
you O
're O
willing O
to O
pay O
another O
200 O
dollar O
for O
a O
windows B-AS
disc I-AS
. O

Very O
good O
quality B-AS
and O
well O
made O
. O

I O
bought O
a O
Logitech O
desktop O
set O
in O
anticipation O
for O
using O
with O
the O
MBP O
, O
but O
I O
use O
the O
touchpad B-AS
90 O
% O
of O
the O
time O
. O

When O
calling O
Dell O
for O
help O
, O
reurn O
, O
or O
a O
new O
computer O
they O
were O
not O
useful O
and O
left O
it O
up O
to O
myself O
to O
figure O
out O
what O
to O
do O
with O
it O
. O

Two O
of O
the O
times O
was O
in O
one O
month O
. O

So O
needless O
to O
day O
, O
I O
' O
m O
not O
happy O
. O

my O
niece O
and O
nephew O
have O
played O
a O
few O
web O
games O
and O
it O
runs O
anything O
that O
does O
n't O
require O
a O
dedicated O
video B-AS
card I-AS
. O

Although O
I O
was O
promised O
about O
10 O
hours O
, O
I O
found O
myself O
to O
a O
limited O
7 O
hours O
which O
is O
still O
amazing O
. O

It O
had O
the O
full O
sized O
touch B-AS
pad I-AS
with O
2 O
buttons O
instead O
of O
just O
one O
. O

It O
was O
also O
cheaper O
than O
the O
Pro O
which O
made O
it O
even O
more O
appealing O
to O
me O
. O

Typically O
, O
when O
I O
purchase O
a O
new O
laptop O
I O
always O
end O
up O
using O
an O
external B-AS
mouse I-AS
for O
convenience O
. O

Consumer O
Report O
recommended O
Toshiba O
. O

Needless O
to O
say O
I O
told O
them O
No O
and O
have O
a O
nice O
day O
and O
hung O
up O
! O

It O
was O
super O
easy O
to O
set B-AS
up I-AS
and O
Is O
really O
easy O
to O
get O
used O
to O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
can O
be O
updated O
is O
the O
video B-AS
, O
other O
than O
that O
you O
're O
all O
set O
. O

It O
was O
n't O
worth O
it O
. O

Its O
a O
good O
laptop O
for O
its O
value B-AS
. O

ANd O
I O
babyed O
the O
heck O
out O
of O
it O
just O
one O
day O
when O
i O
opened O
it O
turned O
it O
on O
went O
to O
click O
and O
it O
was O
broke O
. O

Probbly O
the O
worst O
decision O
we O
ever O
made O
! O

Then O
the O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
failed O
; O

This O
computer O
literally O
takes O
about O
five O
minutes O
to O
start O
up O
and O
to O
be O
able O
to O
use O
without O
it O
crawling O
and O
I O
DO O
mean O
crawling O
. O

I O
had O
less O
problems O
. O

It O
will O
be O
returned O
in O
the O
state O
to O
which O
it O
was O
shipped O
Michigan O
. O

Plain O
and O
simple O
, O
itlaptop O
runs B-AS
great O
and O
loads B-AS
fast O
. O

This O
machine O
rocks O
! O

of O
course O
my O
warranty B-AS
runs O
out O
next O
month O
. O

My O
next O
laptop O
will O
also O
be O
a O
Mac O
! O

But O
not O
in O
this O
case O
. O

taking O
notes O
, O
research O
, O
an O
online O
class O
and O
such O
and O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
spend O
too O
much O
on O
my O
first O
machine O
. O

The O
capabilities O
using O
that O
program B-AS
alone O
made O
me O
want O
a O
Mac O
. O

When O
I O
got O
this O
laptop O
in O
2007 O
to O
help O
me O
with O
school O
, O
I O
had O
a O
hard O
time O
from O
beginning O
. O

I O
do O
not O
know O
for O
sure O
. O

No O
machine O
has O
come O
remotely O
close O
to O
causing O
as O
many O
problems O
. O

Every O
single O
one O
we O
' O
ve O
gotten O
we O
' O
ve O
had O
problems O
with O
. O

it O
is O
the O
worst O
computer O
dell O
ever O
made O
. O

If O
you O
ever O
see O
the O
spinning B-AS
beachball I-AS
come O
up O
when O
you O
think O
it O
should O
n't O
, O
check O
the O
Activity O
Monitor O
app O
to O
see O
if O
the O
disk B-AS
throughput I-AS
has O
temporarily O
dropped O
to O
zero O
. O

I O
have O
found O
also O
, O
it O
is O
very O
easy O
to O
be O
able O
to O
access O
wireless B-AS
internet I-AS
access I-AS
; O

About O
1/2 O
of O
the O
sites O
I O
need O
to O
visit O
because O
of O
my O
work O
contain O
some O
type O
of O
Flash O

This O
is O
a O
great O
value B-AS
for O
the O
money O
. O

It O
was O
a O
great O
laptop O
, O
ran B-AS
great O
and O
was O
really O
fast O
. O

The O
battery B-AS
has O
never O
worked O
well O
. O

return O
it O
. O

I O
can O
guarantee O
this O
will O
be O
the O
last O
Dell O
I O
will O
ever O
purchase O
! O

They O
said O
it O
was O
a O
computer O
error O
on O
this O
type O
of O
computer O
. O

I O
will O
never O
buy O
another O
computer O
from O
Dell O
ever O
again O
do O
to O
how O
awful O
it O
worked O
and O
how O
I O
was O
treated O
by O
the O
company B-AS
. O

My O
review O
mainly O
talks O
about O
the O
difference O
I O
have O
felt O
between O
an O
early O
2011 O
and O
late O
2011 O
mac O
book O
pro O
. O

That O
was O
a O
big O
mistake O
. O

The O
only O
problem O
is O
a O
lack O
of O
screen B-AS
resolutions I-AS
! O

Small O
enough O
to O
use O
on O
a O
long O
flight O
, O
Light O
enough O
to O
carry B-AS
through O
airports O
and O
powerful O
enough O
to O
replace O
my O
desktop O
while O
on O
long O
business O
trips O
. O

Typing O
on O
the O
keyboard B-AS
becomes O
uncomfortable O
after O
extended O
use O
due O
to O
the O
sharp O
edges B-AS
that O
your O
wrists O
rest O
on O
. O

If O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
netbook O
pc O
DO O
NOT O
BUY O
FROM O
ASUS O
! O
! O
! O

It O
has O
many O
great O
programs B-AS
, O
such O
as O
ILife B-AS
, O
iPhotos B-AS
and O
others O
. O

Other O
Thoughts O
, O
Received O
replacement O
16 O
Days O
later O
. O

If O
the O
number O
of O
patrons O
in O
the O
Apple O
store O
are O
any O
indication O
, O
HP O
and O
other O
PC O
manufacturers O
need O
to O
take O
note O
. O

The O
processor B-AS
went O
on O
me O
, O
the O
fan B-AS
went O
and O
the O
motherboard B-AS
went O
. O

I O
bought O
my O
first O
MacBook O
after O
seeing O
the O
product O
demonstrated O
. O

It O
is O
very O
well O
built B-AS
. O

Might O
not O
make O
the O
avid O
gamer O
happy O
but O
I O
do O
n't O
really O
think O
that O
is O
what O
this O
computer O
is O
designed O
for O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
this O
laptop O
to O
anybody O
that O
wants O
great O
performance B-AS
from O
a O
laptop O
and O
would O
like O
to O
relax O
and O
not O
become O
enraged O
cursing O
the O
gods O
about O
to O
throw O
your O
laptop O
out O
the O
door O
. O

The O
screen B-AS
resolution I-AS
was O
exactly O
what O
I O
was O
looking O
for O
. O

Even O
though O
it O
is O
running O
Snow B-AS
Leopard I-AS
, O
24 O
GHz O
C2D O
is O
a O
bit O
of O
an O
antiquated O
CPU B-AS
and O
thus O
the O
occasional O
spinning B-AS
wheel I-AS
would O
appear O
when O
running O
Office B-AS
Mac I-AS
applications I-AS
such O
as O
Word B-AS
or O
Excel B-AS
. O

seriously O
why O
have O
n't O
they O
just O
replaced O
it O
by O
now O
. O

There O
is O
no O
number O
pad B-AS
to O
the O
right O
of O
the O
keyboard B-AS
which O
is O
a O
bummer O
. O

After O
20 O
- O
30 O
min O
the O
screen B-AS
of O
the O
notebook O
switched O
off O
. O

If O
upgrade O
is O
possible O
to O
the O
full O
Windows B-AS
7 I-AS
, O
then O
I O
will O
truly O
be O
a O
very O
happy O
geek O
. O

I O
have O
used O
both O
PCs O
and O
Macs O
and O
I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
I O
really O
really O
love O
my O
Mac O
Book O
Pro O
. O

I O
was O
originally O
concerned O
that O
I O
could O
n't O
view O
work O
I O
had O
done O
in O
college O
on O
my O
Mac O
because O
of O
the O
PC O
formatting O
, O
but O
I O
was O
even O
more O
thrilled O
to O
learn O
of O
programs B-AS
like O
iLife B-AS
and O
iWork B-AS
that O
allow O
you O
to O
convert O
your O
PC O
documents O
into O
readable O
files O
on O
Macs O
. O

It O
is O
a O
big O
big O
, O
but O
since O
it O
has O
a O
184 O
screen O
what O
would O
you O
expect O
! O
. O

I O
have O
never O
had O
an O
experience O
like O
this O
. O

We O
have O
n't O
had O
any O
problems O
with O
it O
at O
all O
. O

returned O
it O
to O
walmart O
. O

10 O
hours O
of O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
is O
really O
something O
else O
. O

I O
love O
everything O
about O
it O
. O

It O
's O
slow O
and O
one O
day O
i O
hope O
to O
have O
the O
money O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
it O
and O
buy O
something O
else O
. O

It O
meets O
all O
my O
needs O
for O
work O
and O
pleasure O
while O
traveling O
. O

Runs B-AS
fast O
and O
the O
regular B-AS
layout I-AS
keyboard I-AS
is O
so O
much O
better O
. O

All O
was O
well O
. O

All O
the O
programs B-AS
are O
easy O
and O
straight O
forward O
on O
my O
MacBook O
Pro O
, O
it O
is O
clean O
and O
organized O
, O
which O
I O
always O
strive O
to O
be O
myself O
. O

He O
said O
quite O
a O
number O
of O
people O
had O
encountered O
this O
problem O
and O
said O
it O
is O
a O
common O
issue O
. O

Not O
worth O
it O
one O
bit O
. O

I O
just O
ca O
n't O
fathom O
that O
the O
celebrated O
Dell O
would O
last O
a O
week O
in O
environment O
of O
free O
competition O
with O
normal O
products O
, O
it O
only O
survives O
b O
/ O
c O
its O
substandard O
laptops O
are O
forced O
onto O
captive O
students O
and O
employees O
through O
question O
- O
raising O
programs O
. O

Much O
of O
which O
HP O
ended O
up O
paying O
for O
. O

I O
reinstalled O
windows B-AS
through O
the O
recovery B-AS
discs I-AS
and O
everything O
seemed O
good O
again O
. O

Windows B-AS
7 I-AS
Starter I-AS
is O
terrific O
no O
you O
ca O
n't O
change O
the O
background O
but O
I O
do O
n't O
need O
to O
, O
I O
use O
it O
just O
for O
school O
work O
. O

Support B-AS
has O
been O
lackluster O
and O
now O
I O
just O
want O
a O
refund O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
they O
had O
no O
record O
of O
me O
having O
the O
3 B-AS
year I-AS
warranty I-AS
I O
'd O
paid O
almost O
$ O
400 O
for O
, O
and O
I O
had O
to O
call O
in O
, O
spend O
hours O
on O
their O
online B-AS
chat I-AS
service I-AS
, O
and O
fax O
in O
multiple O
documents O
. O

I O
hate O
to O
say O
this O
, O
but O
if O
I O
could O
take O
this O
back O
to O
the O
shop O
and O
get O
my O
money O
back O
, O
then O
I O
would O
. O

It O
makes O
doing O
schoolwork O
at O
night O
so O
much O
easier O
. O

Being O
only O
2 O
months O
old O
, O
I O
am O
not O
a O
happy O
camper O
! O

> O
iPhoto B-AS
is O
probably O
the O
best O
program O
I O
have O
ever O
worked O
with O
, O
easy O
and O
convenient O
. O

I O
love O
to O
write O
and O
play O
with O
graphics O
and O
html O
programming O
and O
my O
new O
Toshiba O
works B-AS
great O
on O
both O
! O

THis O
computer O
may O
be O
small O
but O
it O
is O
one O
heck O
of O
a O
power O
horse O
. O

They O
would O
repair O
one O
thing O
, O
send O
it O
back O
and O
it O
would O
still O
have O
the O
same O
problem O
. O

Such O
as O
PAGES O
, O
NUMBERS O
, O
and O
so O
on O
. O

My O
laptop O
now O
has O
no O
battery B-AS
. O

Beta O
had O
better O
quality O
, O
but O
VHS O
became O
the O
industry O
standard O
. O

It O
made O
the O
computer O
much O
easier O
to O
use B-AS
and O
navigate B-AS
. O

, O
-If O
you O
buy O
this O
, O
do O
n't O
go O
into O
it O
expecting O
7 O
hrs O
of O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
, O
and O
you O
'll O
be O
perfectly O
satisfied O
. O

Needs O
longer O
lasting O
battery B-AS
, O
More O
than O
1 O
to O
2 O
Hrs O
. O

in O
May O
I O
started O
having O
problems O
with O
the O
USB B-AS
ports I-AS
not O
working O
. O

10 O
plus O
hours O
of O
battery B-AS
. O

If O
only O
Bill O
Gates O
would O
read O
some O
of O
what O
is O
said O
here O
MS O
would O
do O
a O
better O
job O
. O

The O
design B-AS
is O
awesome O
, O
quality B-AS
is O
unprecedented O
. O

I O
' O
m O
going O
to O
try O
and O
keep O
my O
old O
G4 O
on O
the O
road O
for O
as O
long O
as O
possible O
. O

The O
Mac B-AS
version I-AS
of I-AS
Microsoft I-AS
Office I-AS
is O
cheaper O
than O
buying O
the O
actual O
and O
works O
just O
as O
well O
. O

The O
Mac O
takes O
about O
the O
same O
amount O
of O
starting B-AS
- I-AS
up I-AS
time I-AS
as O
the O
average O
PC O
, O
but O
keeps O
itself O
cleaned O
up O
and O
ready O
to O
use O
. O

Its O
hard O
to O
encounter O
a O
problem O
on O
a O
mac O
that O
would O
require O
such O
abrupt O
action O
. O

The O
Toshiba O
Net O
book O
operates B-AS
very O
well O
. O

I O
loved O
it O
. O

the O
touch B-AS
pad I-AS
is O
fine O
, O
again O
, O
it O
's O
a O
real O
touch B-AS
pad I-AS
. O

The O
pictures B-AS
are O
clear O
as O
can O
be O
. O

It O
is O
also O
very O
lightweight O
, O
making O
transporting B-AS
this O
computer O
very O
easy O
. O

If O
anything O
, O
I O
would O
only O
suggest O
using O
one O
of O
these O
laptops O
if O
only O
you O
have O
to O
. O

I O
sit O
down O
and O
use O
my O
husband O
's O
work O
PC O
and O
I O
do O
n't O
like O
it O
one O
bit O
. O

It O
's O
wonderful O
for O
computer O
gaming B-AS
. O

You O
have O
to O
toss O
out O
the O
wifi B-AS
card I-AS
and O
replace O
it O
just O
to O
have O
any O
sort O
of O
network B-AS
capability I-AS
. O

AND O
the O
best O
part O
is O
that O
it O
even O
comes O
with O
a O
free O
printer B-AS
when O
they O
have O
a O
certain O
promotion O
/ O
offer O
going O
, O
of O
course O
! O

the O
place O
we O
bought O
it O
from O
said O
that O
after O
they O
send O
it O
out O
to O
gateway O
4 O
times O
they O
would O
give O
us O
a O
new O
one O
. O

it O
is O
very O
easy O
for O
anyone O
to O
use B-AS
an O
apple O
and O
specially O
the O
mcbook O
pro O
notebook O
. O

I O
like O
it O
better O
than O
my O
big O
Dell O
Laptop O
. O

The O
flaws O
are O
, O
this O
computer O
is O
not O
for O
computer O
gamers O
because O
of O
the O
OS B-AS
X I-AS
. O

I O
tried O
giving O
it O
0 O
stars O
but O
I O
had O
to O
choose O
at O
least O
one O
, O
but O
IMO O
NO O
STARS O

They O
really O
do O
have O
the O
worlds O
very O
worst O
repair B-AS
service I-AS
. O

They O
need O
to O
stop O
outsoucing O
and O
send O
some O
complaint O
calls O
to O
US O
based O
customer B-AS
service I-AS
agents I-AS
for O
those O
who O
live O
in O
the O
United O
states O
. O

I O
was O
also O
able O
to O
install O
and O
use O
my O
Photoshop B-AS
and O
AfterEffects B-AS
programs I-AS
easily O
. O

It O
's O
perfect O
for O
everything O
and O
runs B-AS
faster O
than O
an O
average O
pc O
! O

for O
being O
so O
small O
it O
is O
amazing O
that O
it O
is O
as O
fast O
as O
it O
is O
. O

Heck O
, O
I O
like O
all O
Mac O
computers O
, O
but O
they O
're O
all O
WAY O
too O
pricey O
for O
the O
kind O
of O
economy O
the O
US O
is O
going O
through O
. O

Then O
after O
paying O
for O
it O
to O
be O
examined O
I O
was O
told O
it O
was O
same O
problem O
cited O
on O
website O
but O
I O
'd O
have O
to O
pay O
anyways O
since O
it O
was O
past O
warrenty B-AS
. O

They O
claim O
that O
I O
should O
be O
happy O
because O
I O
am O
getting O
a O
new O
laptop O
to O
replace O
my O
two O
- O
month O
old O
laptop O
. O

I O
' O
m O
already O
hooked O
on O
the O
sleek O
look B-AS
and O
dependability B-AS
that O
this O
laptop O
has O
shown O
. O

The O
machine O
itself O
is O
alright O
. O

It O
seems O
to O
have O
some O
opions O
that O
are O
intalled O
but O
do O
not O
work O
like O
I O
thought O
they O
would O
. O

And O
having O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
company B-AS
has O
been O
a O
even O
worse O
nightmare O
. O

I O
will O
definitely O
be O
getting O
a O
new O
laptop O
if O
it O
has O
any O
more O
issues O
after O
the O
warranty B-AS
expires O
and O
researching O
carefully O
when O
I O
do O
so O
I O
do O
n't O
run O
accross O
a O
situation O
like O
this O
again O
! O

I O
also O
experience O
the O
same O
with O
my O
MacBook O
Air O
. O

It O
has O
all O
the O
features B-AS
that O
are O
necessary O
for O
college O
and O
if O
not O
they O
are O
able O
to O
be O
added O
onto O
the O
computer O
. O

I O
have O
owned O
many O
different O
brands O
of O
laptops O
in O
my O
life O
. O

I O
did O
an O
internet O
search O
and O
this O
is O
a O
very O
common O
problem O
with O
this O
laptop O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
owned O
this O
labtop O
for O
less O
then O
two O
months O
, O
already O
the O
mouse B-AS
button I-AS
has O
broke O
. O

It O
did O
fairly O
well O
, O
other O
than O
it O
's O
poor O
performance B-AS
, O
overheating O
and O
occational O
blue O
screen O
. O

The O
touchpad B-AS
is O
very O
intuitive O
, O
so O
much O
so O
that O
I O
never O
want O
to O
use O
buttons B-AS
to O
click O
again O
! O

tons O
of O
bloatware O
and O
junk O
programs B-AS
. O

its O
sad O
because O
their O
commercials O
are O
great O
. O

lots O
of O
extra O
space B-AS
but O
the O
keyboard B-AS
is O
ridiculously O
small O
. O

Luckily O
, O
Dell O
said O
they O
would O
replace O
my O
laptop O
with O
a O
new O
one O
, O
but O
instead O
I O
got O
a O
refund O
and O
bought O
a O
mac O
. O

I O
decided O
to O
get O
this O
pile O
of O
crap O
on O
a O
whim O
and O
totally O
freaking O
regret O
it O
. O

Never O
been O
hacked O
. O

It O
's O
so O
bad O
that O
I O
' O
m O
thinking O
I O
only O
got O
half O
a O
battery B-AS
or O
something O
. O

Good O
keyboard B-AS
, O
long O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
, O
largest O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
and O
windows B-AS
7 I-AS
. O

I O
think O
it O
was O
seventy O
nine O
plus O
tax O
. O

In O
summary O
, O
take O
your O
money O
elsewhere O
. O

The O
processor B-AS
is O
very O
quick O
and O
effective O
as O
I O
load B-AS
webpages I-AS
and O
applications B-AS
. O

My O
battery B-AS
went O
bad O
about O
a O
year O
and O
a O
half O
after O
having O
it O
and O
it O
cost O
around O
eighty O
to O
a O
hundred O
dollars O
! O

I O
will O
NEVER O
buy O
Refurbished O
again O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
cae O
how O
cheap O
it O
is O
. O

It O
pretty O
much O
does O
everything O
we O
could O
ever O
need O
, O
and O
looks O
great O
to O
boot B-AS
. O

It O
is O
just O
slow O
slow O
slow O
. O

Bottom O
line O
, O
I O
doubt O
you O
'd O
be O
overly O
disappointed O
if O
you O
invest O
in O
this O
machine O
. O

As O
a O
lifelong O
Windows B-AS
user O
, O
I O
was O
extremely O
pleased O
to O
make O
the O
change O
to O
Mac O
. O

So O
, O
owing O
to O
these O
problems O
, O
I O
went O
out O
and O
got O
myself O
an O
Apple O
MacBook O
Pro O
, O
which O
I O
am O
using O
with O
great O
satisfaction O
at O
this O
very O
moment O
. O

The O
Macbook O
Pro O
is O
extremely O
thin O
and O
light O
compared O
to O
those O
heavy O
Windows O
Laptop O
. O

So O
this O
was O
great O
for O
me O
. O

This O
is O
the O
first O
macbook O
I O
have O
ever O
had O
. O

The O
acer O
one O
compuer O
is O
a O
great O
computer O
. O

another O
problem O
. O

The O
Macbook O
is O
also O
made O
better O
, O
my O
computer O
has O
never O
got O
a O
virus O
, O
and O
the O
laptop O
runs B-AS
just O
as O
fast O
as O
the O
first O
day O
I O
bought O
it O
. O

So O
, O
if O
you O
're O
thinking O
of O
a O
laptop O
, O
I O
would O
heartily O
recommend O
theApple O
133 O
MacBook O
Pro O
Notebook O
Computer O
Z0J80001 O
Notebook O
for O
all O
your O
needs O
! O
. O

I O
wiped O
nearly O
everything O
off O
of O
it O
, O
installed O
OpenOffice B-AS
and O
Firefox B-AS
, O
and O
I O
am O
operating O
an O
incredibly O
efficient O
and O
useful O
machine O
for O
a O
great O
price B-AS
. O

Overall O
I O
feel O
this O
netbook O
was O
poor O
quality B-AS
, O
had O
poor O
performance B-AS
, O
although O
it O
did O
have O
great O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
when O
it O
did O
work O
. O

I O
picked O
it O
out O
becaASPECT0 O
it O
was O
inexpensive O
$ O
400 O
and O
I O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
a O
good O
, O
easy O
to O
use B-AS
first O
laptop O
. O

MY O
ONLY O
PROBLEM O
IS O
I O
CAN O
NOT O
REG O
THE O
PRODUCT B-AS
KEY I-AS
. O

The O
Time O
remaining O
goes O
from O
4 O
hours O
plus O
to O
less O
than O
2 O
hours O
over O
the O
span O
of O
about O
10 O
minutes O
. O

Pay O
attention O
to O
the O
specs B-AS
if O
you O
want O
these O
options O
. O

Stupidly O
, O
mind O
- O
numbingly O
slow O
-- O
then O
I O
found O
it O
can O
only O
be O
loaded O
with O
2 O
GB O
* O
maximum O
* O
. O

It O
also O
does O
not O
have O
bluetooth B-AS
. O

Sure O
it O
has O
the O
one B-AS
touch I-AS
keys I-AS
but O
that O
was O
the O
best O
feature O
of O
the O
computer O
. O

I O
can O
do O
pretty O
much O
75 O
% O
of O
what O
I O
do O
on O
my O
desktop O
on O
my O
kitchen O
table O
. O

Being O
a O
PC O
user O
my O
whole O
life O
. O

great O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
. O

The O
real O
stand O
out O
on O
this O
computer O
is O
the O
feel O
of O
the O
keyboard B-AS
and O
it O
's O
speed B-AS
. O

At O
first O
, O
the O
computer O
seemed O
a O
great O
deal O
-- O
seemingly O
high O
- O
end O
specs B-AS
for O
a O
low O
, O
low O
price B-AS
. O

Delivery B-AS
was O
early O
too O
. O

During O
that O
time O
, O
I O
had O
to O
send O
it O
back O
3 O
times O
. O

Although O
I O
opted O
for O
the O
lowest O
end O
MacBook O
Pro O
, O
this O
thing O
holds O
its O
own O
. O

Love O
the O
stability B-AS
of O
the O
Mac B-AS
software I-AS
and O
operating B-AS
system I-AS
. O

And O
that O
probably O
explains O
why O
I O
' O
ve O
already O
had O
my O
SATA B-AS
controller I-AS
go O
bad O
within O
a O
year O
of O
buying O
it O
. O

I O
left O
the O
place O
angrily O
. O

I O
my O
wife O
is O
also O
now O
the O
proud O
owner O
of O
a O
Macbook O
as O
well O
! O

I O
' O
ve O
had O
a O
Toshiba O
laptop O
in O
the O
past O
; O

It O
's O
also O
very O
capable O
of O
doing O
moderate O
video B-AS
editing I-AS
although O
you O
may O
need O
the O
performance B-AS
boost O
of O
the O
larger O
MacBook O
Pros O
for O
heavy O
duty O
mobile O
video B-AS
editing I-AS
. O

ASUS O
said O
my O
net O
- O
book O
was O
working O
properly O
. O

I O
received O
this O
laptop O
as O
a O
gift O
and O
let O
me O
just O
tell O
you O
that O
its O
the O
worst O
. O

Very O
annoying O
. O

My O
main O
reason O
to O
convert O
was O
the O
imovie B-AS
program I-AS
. O

It O
has O
a O
faster O
processor B-AS
and O
more O
ram B-AS
. O

If O
you O
need O
an O
affordable O
, O
entry O
- O
level O
laptop O
, O
this O
will O
fit O
the O
bill O
. O

Laptops O
are O
usually O
used O
on O
the O
go O
, O
so O
why O
not O
give O
you O
a O
better O
battery B-AS
? O

I O
will O
never O
complain O
about O
the O
price O
since O
I O
believe O
you O
get O
what O
you O
pay O
for O
and O
my O
MacBook O
Pro O
was O
worth O
every O
dollar O
. O

I O
was O
n't O
a O
big O
fan O
of O
the O
Netbooks O
but O
this O
one O
was O
very O
well O
designed B-AS
. O

It O
may O
take O
a O
little O
getting O
used O
to O
but O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
viruses O
or O
other O
headaches O
. O

And O
the O
warranty B-AS
on O
this O
macbook O
pro O
can O
last O
up O
to O
5 O
years O
or O
1000 O
battery O
recharge O
cycles O
. O

I O
still O
have O
that O
stupid O
bluetooth B-AS
mouse I-AS
to O
! O

Would O
like O
more O
trendy O
, O
high O
tech O
features B-AS
. O

Keyboard B-AS
is O
great O
but O
primary O
and O
secondary O
control B-AS
buttons I-AS
could O
be O
more O
durable O
. O

Screen O
is O
a O
bit O
glossy O
, O
but O
that O
's O
not O
too O
bad O
. O

Received O
the O
product O
promptly O
and O
without O
any O
issues O
. O

It O
is O
so O
great O
, O
I O
can O
Hardly O
ever O
take O
my O
hands O
off O
it O
! O

I O
remind O
myself O
from O
time O
to O
time O
to O
take O
off O
my O
watch O
when O
ever O
I O
look O
at O
the O
small O
scratch O
that O
it O
has O
caused O
. O

I O
got O
it O
back O
again O
and O
was O
told O
the O
motherboard B-AS
had O
been O
replaced O
, O
so O
I O
was O
now O
on O
the O
SECOND O
motherboard B-AS
within O
3 O
months O
. O

But O
reasons O
we O
chose O
this O
Apple O
computer O
. O

Processor B-AS
, O
When O
compared O
to O
my O
3 O
week O
old O
Early O
2011 O
edition O
there O
I O
barely O
experience O
any O
difference O
in O
performance B-AS
23 O
GHz O
v O
/ O
s O
24 O
GHz O
. O

They O
say O
it O
could O
be O
the O
motherboard B-AS
again O
, O
but O
Dell O

I O
upgraded O
from O
a O
5 O
year O
old O
laptop O
and O
was O
amazed O
to O
find O
out O
that O
this O
computer O
is O
much O
slower O
then O
my O
old O
laptop O
. O

2nd O
Best O
computer O
in O
the O
world O
only O
one O
way O
this O
computer O
might O
become O
the O
best O
is O
that O
it O
needs O
to O
upgreade O
patches B-AS
to O
make O
less O
easier O
for O
people O
to O
hack O
into O

Love O
the O
speed B-AS
, O
especially O
! O

It O
could O
be O
a O
perfect O
laptop O
if O
it O
would O
have O
faster O
system B-AS
memory I-AS
and O
its O
radeon B-AS
5850 I-AS
would O
have O
DDR5 B-AS
instead O
of O
DDR3 B-AS
. O

Not O
only O
are O
the O
versions O
of O
these O
programs B-AS
able O
to O
be O
saved O
, O
worked O
on O
and O
opened O
on O
both O
a O
PC O
and O
Mac O
, O
the O
versions O
of O
these O
programs B-AS
on O
a O
Mac O
are O
graphically O
and O
functionally O
superior O
. O

By O
Air O
sounds O
more O
like O
by O
truck O
to O
Me O
. O

So O
far O
it O
has O
been O
five O
months O
since O
the O
last O
problem O
was O
fixed O
and O
I O
am O
PRAYING O
it O
has O
finally O
stopped O
. O

It O
's O
outstanding O
too O
. O

The O
speed B-AS
gives O
you O
the O
power O
to O
work O
on O
these O
projects O
seamlessly O
, O
and O
multiple O
at O
a O
time O
if O
you O
sowish O
. O

Awesome O
laptop O
and O
the O
perfect O
size B-AS
to O
carry O
around O
in O
college O
. O

So O
I O
' O
m O
disappointed O
in O
that O
because O
communicating O
with O
my O
relatives O
out O
of O
the O
area O
is O
a O
priority O
. O

A O
MONTH O
LATER O
, O
we O
reinstall O
the O
OS B-AS
( I-AS
Vista I-AS
) I-AS
. O

Some O
problems O
can O
be O
fixed O
if O
you O
purchase O
new O
software B-AS
, O
but O
there O
is O
no O
guarentee O
. O

My O
real O
problem O
with O
it O
? O
The O
statement O
of O
7 O
hour O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
is O
not O
just O
mere O
exaggeration O
- O
it O
's O
a O
lie O
. O

just O
chill O
and O
enjoy O
. O

The O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
is O
also O
relatively O
good O
. O

It O
is O
her O
first O
laptop O
and O
she O
is O
thrilled O
. O

I O
should O
have O
sent O
it O
back O
to O
them O
then O
. O

I O
definitely O
suggest O
getting O
an O
extended B-AS
warranty I-AS
, O
you O
will O
probably O
need O
it O
! O

If O
this O
would O
be O
your O
first O
Mac O
purchase O
then O
I O
would O
highly O
suggest O
that O
you O
take O
advantage O
of O
the O
class O
that O
they O
offer O
to O
learn O
about O
the O
differences O
between O
Mac O
and O
PC O
's O
. O

This O
laptop O
leaves O
alot O
to O
be O
desired O
, O
I O
have O
had O
it O
only O
5 O
months O
and O
have O
had O
to O
send O
it O
away O
to O
be O
repaired O
twice O
. O

I O
have O
found O
it O
very O
easy O
to O
use B-AS
, O
very O
imformative O
, O
wonder O
alerts O
and O
tutorials O
making O
it O
very O
easy O
for O
someone O
like O
me O
who O
is O
not O
exactly O
technologically O
advanced O
to O
learn O
to O
use B-AS
the O
various O
features B-AS
and O
programs B-AS
. O

I O
do O
n't O
have O
stupid O
pop B-AS
up I-AS
windows I-AS
even O
when O
I O
have O
pop B-AS
ups I-AS
blocked O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
wait O
5 O
minutes O
for O
a O
webpage O
to O
download O
, O
and O
best O
of O
all O
I O
can O
run O
all O
the O
web B-AS
programming I-AS
software I-AS
I O
need O
to O
use O
all O
at O
once O
without O
slowing O
me O
down O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
laptop O
so O
that O
the O
entire O
family O
had O
a O
computer O
in O
the O
living O
room O
; O

Do O
n't O
waste O
your O
money O
or O
time O
. O

It O
has O
spent O
more O
time O
in O
repair O
shops O
than O
i O
can O
possibly O
recount O
here O
. O

Memory B-AS
is O
upgradable O
. O

Web B-AS
access I-AS
through O
the O
3 B-AS
G I-AS
network I-AS
is O
so O
slow O
, O
it O
's O
very O
frustrating O
and O
VERY O
DISAPPOINTING O
. O

Well O
, O
I O
bought O
this O
laptop O
a O
month O
or O
two O
ago O
. O

My O
MacBook O
Pro O
has O
been O
a O
huge O
disappointment O
. O

Received O
all O
four O
in O
good O
order O
; O

The O
computer O
first O
started O
malfunctioning O
3 O
months O
after O
purchasing O
it O
. O

this O
is O
starting O
off O
good O
. O

The O
large O
screen B-AS
also O
helps O
when O
you O
are O
working O
in O
design B-AS
based I-AS
programs I-AS
like O
Adobe B-AS
Creative I-AS
Suite I-AS
. O

The O
only O
pro O
to O
this O
computer O
is O
it O
was O
under O
$ O
600 O
! O

Moral O
of O
the O
story O
, O
-Do O
not O
buy O
anything O
from O
companies B-AS
that O
do O
not O
respect O
their O
customers O
. O

This O
is O
my O
first O
Dell O
I O
heard O
their O
customer B-AS
service I-AS
was O
lacking O
and O
that O
they O
were O
working O
on O
improving O
it O
! O

As O
well O
as O
having O
the O
plug B-AS
in O
the O
computer O
come O
loose O
. O

Very O
small O
and O
portable O
I O
' O
ve O
had O
this O
netbook O
about O
12 O
hrs O
now O
and O
It O
's O
better O
than O
expected O
. O

She O
said O
Wal O
Mart O
rants O
and O
raves O
abouy O
carring O
Dell O
because O
it O
's O
a O
big O
name O
but O
they O
are O
a O
piece O
of O
garbage O
. O

NOT O
WITH O
APPLE O
. O

After O
3 O
pleasant O
weeks O
of O
use O
, O
the O
laptop O
just O
died O
. O

Each O
time O
taking O
about O
1 O
day O
or O
so O
. O

Second O
HDD B-AS
cover I-AS
has O
walls O
inside O
that O
need O
to O
be O
broken O
if O
you O
what O
to O
install O
one O
. O

If O
you O
want O
more O
information O
on O
macs O
I O
suggest O
going O
to O
applecom O
and O
heading O
towards O
the O
macbook O
page O
for O
more O
information O
on O
the O
applications B-AS
. O

So O
a O
couple O
of O
years O
later O
, O
I O
was O
a O
dumb O
college O
girl O
and O
had O
to O
have O
the O
wireless O
internet O
. O

This O
netbook O
went O
bad O
on O
me O
after O
3 O
days O
. O

Probably O
wo O
n't O
work O
either O
. O

Great O
product O
by O
Apple O
with O
the O
new O
great O
looking O
design B-AS
. O

I O
love O
the O
keyboard B-AS
. O

Probably O
as O
good O
as O
you O
can O
get O
in O
a O
netbook O
, O
does O
everything O
I O
ask O
for O
and O
has O
some O
very O
good O
unexpected O
pluses O
. O

Overall O
I O
am O
very O
satisfied O
with O
the O
purchase O
. O

In O
my O
line O
of O
work O
, O
I O
often O
have O
to O
take O
work O
home O
, O
and O
this O
makes O
it O
so O
easy O
. O

They O
told O
me O
to O
reprogram O
the O
computer O
, O
and O
I O
did O
n't O
need O
to O
do O
that O
, O
and O
I O
lost O
pictures O
of O
my O
oldests O
first O
2 O
years O
of O
her O
life O
. O

I O
use O
iphoto B-AS
all O
the O
time O
, O
which O
is O
a O
great O
program B-AS
for O
anyone O
who O
is O
into O
photography O
, O
amateurs O
and O
experts O
alike O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
laptop O
for O
my O
son O
in O
2007 O
for O
his O
Christmas O
present O
. O

It O
took O
so O
much O
time O
. O

I O
hate O
it O
. O

The O
screen O
is O
n't O
huge O
, O
but O
that O
does O
n't O
matter O
when O
I O
output O
media O
to O
the O
50 O
inch O
LCD O
TV O
. O

I O
'll O
stick O
to O
Tashiba O
. O

I O
will O
have O
to O
purchase O
Spy B-AS
ware I-AS
or O
Nortell B-AS
for O
privacy O
protection O
. O

You O
will O
not O
regret O
buying O
such O
a O
great O
thing O
like O
this O
! O

I O
was O
said O
it O
's O
videocard B-AS
. O

Plus O
stylish O
. O

For O
the O
price B-AS
and O
what O
I O
get O
out O
of O
it O
has O
exceeded O
my O
expectations O
. O

And O
, O
if O
you O
are O
going O
to O
deal O
with O
HP O
be O
careful O
. O

I O
took O
the O
computer O
into O
Best O
Buy O
where O
I O
purchased O
it O
and O
they O
kept O
it O
over O
night O
to O
study O
it O
. O

If O
your O
time O
is O
worth O
anything O
to O
you O
, O
if O
you O
are O
tired O
of O
rebooting O
, O
reformatting O
, O
reinstalling O
, O
trying O
to O
find O
drivers B-AS
, O
if O
you O
want O
a O
computer O
to O
work O
for O
you O
for O
a O
change O
, O
make O
the O
change O
to O
this O
computer O
. O

My O
MacBook O
Pro O
is O
no O
exception O
. O

Unless O
you O
do O
n't O
care O
how O
long O
it O
takes O
to O
get O
going O
, O
find O
something O
else O
. O

You O
may O
be O
reading O
one O
now O
! O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
wish O
is O
the O
15 O
inch O
MacBook O
Pro O
has O
much O
better O
speakers B-AS
on O
the O
side O
of O
the O
keyboard B-AS
. O

I O
will O
have O
to O
say O
that O
I O
love O
my O
MacBook O
Pro O
! O

In O
fact O
, O
he O
said O
, O
about O
10 O
% O
of O
their O
products O
fail O
. O

This O
is O
the O
first O
Apple O
product O
that O
I O
have O
purchased O
. O

Now O
, O
as O
easy O
as O
it O
is O
to O
use B-AS
, O
and O
I O
do O
think O
it O
is O
a O
great O
STARTER O
laptop O
. O

This O
causes O
my O
wrist O
to O
scrape O
up O
against O
it O
. O

Enough O
said O
. O

Setting B-AS
would O
change O
for O
some O
reason O
, O
the O
screen B-AS
size I-AS
would O
change O
on O
it O
's O
own O
, O
like O
the O
pixel B-AS
sizes I-AS
and O
whatnot O
. O

It O
had O
some O
kind O
of O
pre B-AS
installed I-AS
software I-AS
update I-AS
that O
completely O
shut O
the O
computer O
down O
when O
you O
clicked O
it O
. O

Ever O
since O
I O
bought O
this O
laptop O
, O
so O
far O
I O
' O
ve O
experience O
nothing O
but O
constant O
break O
downs O
of O
the O
laptop O
and O
bad O
customer B-AS
services I-AS
I O
received O
over O
the O
phone O
with O
toshiba O
customer B-AS
services I-AS
hotlines O
. O

I O
do O
not O
plan O
on O
going O
back O
. O

No O
laptop O
is O
perfect O
, O
but O
sometimes O
you O
just O
find O
a O
computer O
that O
works O
for O
you O
. O

I O
really O
like O
the O
Mac O
154 O
in O
Notebook O
, O
but O
its O
very O
pricey O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
space B-AS
bar I-AS
makes O
a O
noisy O
click O
every O
time O
you O
use O
it O
. O

iPhotos B-AS
is O
an O
excellent O
program B-AS
for O
storing O
and O
organizing O
photos O
. O

Other O
than O
that O
its O
a O
great O
performing B-AS
machine O
and O
well O
meets O
all O
my O
needs O
and O
more O
. O

We O
were O
occasional O
Mac O
users O
before O
, O
but O
most O
recently O
owned O
a O
budget O
PC O
since O
it O
is O
what O
we O
could O
afford O
. O

Called O
tech O
support O
and O
got O
the O
usual O
Acer O
We O
do O
n't O
support O
software B-AS
but O
for O
$ O
$ O
$ O
we O
can O
help O
you O
I O
explained O
there O
was O
no O
software B-AS
involved O
in O
booting B-AS
. O

I O
would O
never O
tell O
anyone O
to O
buy O
one O
either O
. O

The O
programs B-AS
are O
great O
, O
like O
iphoto B-AS
love O
the O
editing O
capabilities O
, O
imail B-AS
which O
can O
incorporate O
with O
the O
address O
book O
on O
the O
ipod O
and O
ipad O
, O
imovie B-AS
, O
etc O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
did O
n't O
learn O
in O
my O
research O
was O
the O
software B-AS
I O
would O
need O
like O
privacy O
protection O
and O
warranty O
protection O
, O
in O
case O
it O
gets O
broken O
, O
or O
crashes O
etc O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
say O
enough O
good O
for O
it O
! O

Comfterbale O
to O
use B-AS
light O
easy O
to O
transport B-AS
. O

The O
Computer O
itself O
is O
a O
good O
product O
but O
the O
repair B-AS
depot I-AS
stinks O
. O

I O
thought O
the O
price B-AS
was O
great O
for O
the O
specs B-AS
. O

I O
was O
tired O
of O
going O
without O
my O
laptop O
every O
few O
weeks O
. O

the O
only O
down O
fall O
is O
that O
it O
has O
no O
cd B-AS
drive I-AS
but O
i O
found O
that O
they O
are O
very O
cheap O
to O
by O
and O
also O
very O
portable O
making O
this O
the O
best O
friend O
to O
someone O
who O
is O
always O
looking O
for O
more O
space O
then O
they O
have O
. O

So O
, O
the O
hard B-AS
disk I-AS
capacity I-AS
really O
does O
n't O
matter O
to O
me O
. O

Just O
for O
a O
stupid O
CD O
. O

Keys B-AS
stick O
periodically O
and O
I O
have O
nt O
had O
the O
laptop O
for O
45 O
days O
yet O
. O

It O
crashes O
, O
and O
when O
it O
goes O
flat O
, O
it O
just O
DIES O
like O
a O
PC O
, O
maybe O
worse O
and O
I O
loose O
all O
my O
open O
documents O
! O

I O
also O
like O
that O
you O
can O
scroll O
down O
in O
a O
window O
using O
two O
fingers O
on O
the O
trackpad B-AS
. O

Everything O
from O
the O
design B-AS
to O
the O
OS B-AS
is O
simple O
and O
to O
the O
point O
. O

I O
am O
now O
making O
a O
point O
to O
avoid O
their O
products O
and O
I O
hope O
my O
experience O
can O
serve O
as O
a O
warning O
to O
you O
as O
well O
. O

I'v O
spent O
as O
much O
for O
shipping B-AS
as O
I O
would O
to O
buy O
a O
new O
netbook O
- O
of O
course O
a O
different O
brand O
. O

I O
personally O
like O
the O
gaming B-AS
look I-AS
but O
needed O
a O
machine O
that O
delivered O
gaming B-AS
performance I-AS
while O
still O
looking O
professional O
in O
front O
of O
my O
customers O
. O

This O
just O
keeps O
having O
it O
's O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
replaced O
! O

When O
you O
look O
at O
the O
specs O
on O
Apple O
products O
in O
comparison O
to O
a O
Dell O
or O
a O
HP O
, O
yes O
they O
do O
seem O
to O
offer O
less O
for O
a O
higher O
cost B-AS
. O

Then O
I O
proceed O
to O
tell O
her O
that O
I O
checked O
out O
other O
retail O
stores O
that O
carry O
the O
netbook O
and O
it O
was O
n't O
LIKE O
THAT O
. O

Then O
they O
had O
me O
jump O
through O
many O
hoops O
and O
questions O
to O
see O
if O
they O
could O
find O
another O
way O
to O
invalidate O
me O
. O

The O
only O
downfall O
is O
the O
volume B-AS
control I-AS
. O

Clearly O
, O
there O
is O
something O
wrong O
with O
the O
product O
and O
LG O
did O
n't O
take O
up O
the O
responsibility O
. O

Very O
fast O
boot B-AS
up I-AS
and O
shut B-AS
down I-AS
. O

Right O
out O
of O
the O
box O
, O
this O
little O
netbook O
did O
everything O
I O
asked O
of O
it O
, O
including O
streaming O
the O
everyday O
video O
you O
're O
bound O
to O
encounter O
checking O
mail O
and O
websites O
my O
biggest O
complaint O
previously O
. O

I O
am O
very O
happy O
with O
this O
laptop O
. O

this O
laptop O
is O
durable O
and O
it O
is O
easy O
to O
travel O
with O
. O

I O
finally O
decided O
on O
this O
laptop O
because O
it O
was O
the O
right O
price B-AS
for O
what O
I O
need O
it O
. O

What O
a O
mistake O
! O

If O
internet B-AS
connectivity I-AS
is O
important O
I O
would O
recommend O
going O
with O
a O
dell O
net O
book O
for O
50 O
bucks O
more O
, O
or O
buy O
a O
USB B-AS
wireless I-AS
card I-AS
. O

I O
had O
read O
online O
that O
some O
users O
were O
having O
sound B-AS
problems O
. O

My O
last O
computer O
, O
a O
Toshiba O
, O
cost B-AS
only O
$ O
400 O
, O
and O
worked O
like O
a O
charm O
for O
many O
years O
. O

It O
discharges B-AS
too O
quickly O
. O

But O
to O
be O
honest O
, O
the O
compatibility B-AS
issues O
and O
the O
other O
little O
quirks O
make O
me O
think O
I O
ll O
buy O
a O
PC O
next O
time O
. O

three O
years O
is O
a O
decent O
life O
, O
but O
this O
must O
make O
it O
to O
graduation O
and O
beyond O
. O

I O
work O
on O
a O
PC O
at O
home O
and O
have O
used O
Pc O
all O
through O
college O
. O

TOSHIBA O
WILL O
NOT O
ACKNOWLEDGE O
THIS O
PROBLEM O
. O

Then O
it O
ceased O
charging B-AS
at O
all O
. O

An O
absolutely O
hateful O
machine O
that O
no O
one O
should O
get O
of O
their O
own O
free O
will O
. O

I O
do O
not O
experience O
a O
lot O
of O
heat O
coming O
out O
of O
it O
, O
however O
I O
would O
highly O
suggest O
purchasing O
a O
stand B-AS
however O
, O
due O
to O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
design B-AS
of O
the O
macbook O
as O
it O
is O
one O
very O
large O
heat B-AS
sink I-AS
. O

* O
is O
a O
bit O
laggy O
, O
not O
the O
greatest O
. O

I O
am O
not O
much O
of O
a O
computer O
techie O
, O
so O
I O
can O
understand O
some O
of O
the O
internal O
problems O
, O
though O
I O
do O
have O
trend B-AS
micro I-AS
as O
an O
antiviral B-AS
program I-AS
. O

Stay O
away O
from O
HP O
. O

The O
computer O
continued O
to O
give O
me O
issues O
and O
in O
Late O
June O
it O
completely O
died O
again O
and O
I O
tried O
to O
call O
Acer O
again O
to O
get O
it O
fixed O
and O
they O
refused O
to O
help O
me O
, O
they O
said O
my O
warrenty B-AS
was O
up O
and O
hung O
up O
on O
me O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
have O
n't O
had O
any O
major O
problems O
with O
the O
laptop O
except O
that O
the O
plastic B-AS
piece I-AS
that O
covers O
the O
usb B-AS
port I-AS
wires I-AS
have O
all O
come O
off O
. O

Wonderful O
sleek O
case B-AS
design I-AS
is O
only O
on O
the O
outside O
. O

It O
is O
speedy O
when O
connected O
wirelessly O
to O
any O
network O
regardless O
if O
the O
connection B-AS
is O
weak O
or O
not O
. O

I O
like O
it O
! O

The O
pricing B-AS
is O
very O
competitive O
. O

so O
we O
got O
a O
good O
deal O
on O
hsn O
for O
an O
ascer O
notebook O
and O
we O
bought O
it O
for O
him O
. O

Connecting O
to O
my O
wireless O
router O
via O
built B-AS
- I-AS
in I-AS
wireless I-AS
took O
no O
time O
at O
all O
. O

Its O
still O
going O
. O

This O
computer O
is O
exceptionally O
thin O
for O
it O
's O
screen B-AS
size I-AS
and O
processing B-AS
power I-AS
. O

There O
is O
NO O
way O
I O
will O
buy O
a O
LG O
product O
in O
the O
future O
. O

I O
have O
not O
had O
a O
problem O
with O
the O
applications B-AS
quitting O
or O
freezing O
. O

Prior O
to O
this O
computer O
, O
I O
owned O
a O
PowerBook O
G4 O
for O
6 O
years O
quite O
a O
long O
time O
for O
a O
laptop O
. O

Maybe O
this O
is O
virus O
related O
, O
maybe O
not O
, O
but O
the O
computer O
has O
locked O
up O
many O
times O
, O
and O
on O
two O
occasions O
, O
the O
screen B-AS
has O
simply O
gone O
black O
. O

The O
advantages O
of O
owning O
a O
mac O
are O
numerous O
. O

I O
challenge O
anyone O
to O
show O
proof O
that O
through O
anywhere O
near O
normal O
use O
can O
get O
more O
than O
25 O
hrs O
out O
of O
it O
. O

Using O
this O
machine O
is O
like O
a O
mild O
form O
of O
torture O
. O

This O
wiped O
out O
several O
programs B-AS
that O
were O
installed O
on O
the O
computer O
when O
it O
was O
bought O
. O

On O
the O
twelfth O
day O
that O
I O
had O
the O
notebook O
, O
I O
decided O
to O
go O
to O
Dell O
's O
website O
and O
update O
it O
. O

The O
computer O
blinks O
it O
shuts O
off O
at O
will O
. O

Excellent O
product O
for O
the O
money O
. O

It O
's O
graphics B-AS
are O
n't O
bad O
at O
all O
, O
for O
the O
lower O
end O
of O
the O
MacBook O
Pro O
spectrum O
, O
easily O
capable O
of O
running O
StarCraft O
II O
and O
other O
games O
with O
comparable O
graphics B-AS
. O

I O
have O
Vista B-AS
, O
so O
I O
am O
unable O
to O
install B-AS
and O
unASPECT2 O
some O
programs B-AS
. O

The O
screen B-AS
is O
bright O
and O
vivid O
and O
the O
keyboard B-AS
is O
very O
easy O
to O
use O
, O
very O
important O
for O
use O
quick O
typers O
. O

I O
can O
do O
everything O
I O
could O
before O
, O
only O
faster O
and O
more O
efficiently O
. O

I O
called O
Toshiba O
and O
they O
want O
me O
to O
be O
without O
my O
laptop O
for O
about O
two O
weeks O
while O
they O
look O
at O
the O
problem O
. O

the O
mouse B-AS
jumps O
around O
all O
the O
time O
and O
it O
clicks O
stuff O
i O
do O
n't O
want O
it O
too O
. O

i O
do O
n't O
understand O
why O
i O
spent O
twice O
as O
much O
to O
get O
a O
laptop O
rather O
than O
a O
desktop O
when O
my O
lap O
top O
is O
completely O
immoble O
. O

For O
those O
that O
care O
about O
noise B-AS
this O
thing O
does O
n't O
really O
make O
any O
; O

Here O
we O
are O
another O
year O
later O
and O
the O
computer O
is O
doing O
the O
same O
thing O
. O

Despite O
the O
plethora O
of O
problems O
, O
I O
managed O
to O
use O
technological O
trickery O
to O
keep O
the O
machine O
operational O
for O
two O
years O
. O

I O
had O
my O
IWORKS B-AS
, O
Itunes B-AS
, O
Email O
, O
MS B-AS
Office I-AS
, O
network O
and O
printers O
set O
up O
and O
completely O
working O
perfectly O
within O
an O
hour O
. O

Simply O
amazing O
computer O
! O
! O

I O
first O
purchased O
this O
Dell O
model O
1764 O
on O
April O
6 O
, O
201 O

The O
macbooks O
are O
small O
enough O
to O
be O
very O
portable O
yet O
hold O
tons O
of O
information O
and O
performance B-AS
. O

Two O
times O
with O
in O
one O
month O
. O

The O
only O
downfall O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
the O
software B-AS
I O
have O
wo O
n't O
work O
with O
Mac O
and O
iWork B-AS
is O
not O
worth O
the O
price B-AS
of O
it O
. O

Waited O
on O
getting O
this O
computer O
, O
but O
it O
has O
been O
a O
great O
change O
. O

For O
my O
burn O
thigh O
which O
has O
put O
a O
permanent O
mark O
on O
my O
skin O
it O
happened O
7 O
months O
ago O
they O
offered O
me O
an O
ITouch O
8Gig O
you O
know O
it O
is O
a O
bit O
insulating O
when O
a O
company O
this O
rich O
, O
offer O
a O
loyal O
customer O
like O
me O
, O
a O
bottom O
of O
their O
product O
line O
as O
a O
gift O
for O
events O
like O
this O
. O

Whenever O
tried O
to O
turn O
it O
on O
, O
it O
would O
restart O
as O
soon O
as O
the O
BIOS B-AS
launched O
Windows B-AS
or O
Winblows O
, O
as O
I O
like O
ot O
call O
it O
. O

BUT O
there O
's O
this O
application B-AS
called O
Boot B-AS
Camp I-AS
which O
allows O
you O
to O
add O
another O
OS B-AS
X I-AS
like O
Windows B-AS
. O

The O
mousepad B-AS
is O
a O
huge O
pain O
in O
the O
arse O
! O

I O
hope O
to O
edit O
this O
in O
the O
next O
few O
hours O
, O
I O
am O
going O
to O
try O
to O
install O
my O
own O
copy O
of O
Windows B-AS
7 I-AS
. O

If O
it O
's O
not O
shipped O
on O
the O
next O
business O
day O
, O
called O
on O
a O
Friday O
they O
are O
closed O
on O
weekends O
, O
what O
was O
the O
next O
step O
. O

I O
also O
purchased O
Applecare B-AS
for O
$ O
300 O
, O
which O
is O
a O
three O
year O
extended B-AS
warranty I-AS
, O
since O
I O
ve O
never O
seen O
any O
laptop O
that O
lasted O
more O
than O
two O
. O

I O
have O
had O
the O
netbook O
for O
2 O
months O
and O
I O
love O
it O
, O
I O
read O
some O
reviews O
that O
say O
netbooks O
are O
slow O
but O
it O
does O
not O
seem O
any O
slower O
than O
the O
other O
computers O
I O
use O
. O

I O
run O
windows B-AS
via O
bootcamp B-AS
for O
the O
couple O
programs B-AS
I O
do O
not O
want O
to O
buy O
a O
mac O
version O
of O
, O
like O
my O
cad O
programs B-AS
. O

C'm O
on O
, O
LG O
. O

Whenever O
I O
call O
Dell O
about O
an O
unrelated O
problem O
, O
they O
ask O
me O
if O
my O
laptop O
is O
running O
slowly O
and O
if O
I O
'd O
like O
to O
purchase O
more O
memory B-AS
for O
$ O
75 O
. O

since O
then O
i O
have O
had O
minor O
problems O
with O
slow O
operation B-AS
. O

If O
you O
faintly O
come O
close O
to O
touching O
this O
thing O
while O
typing O
, O
all O
craziness O
may O
break O
loose O
. O

Registration/1st O
use B-AS
is O
easy O
. O

I O
love O
this O
laptop O
, O
and O
use O
it O
everyday O
to O
do O
something O
, O
and O
never O
lets O
me O
down O
. O

Finally O
was O
able O
to O
reach O
a O
young O
lady O
in O
California O
and O
ordered O
the O
machine O
and O
was O
subsequently O
given O
a O
delivery O
date O
. O

I O
definitely O
will O
buy O
a O
Mac O
again O
if O
and O
when O
this O
computer O
ever O
fails O
. O

The O
Toshiba O
Mini O
Notebook O
, O
Model O
NB O
305-N410BL O
, O
is O
a O
great O
little O
computer O
. O

Take O
your O
time O
and O
go O
through O
the O
tutorials B-AS
patiently O
. O

So O
if O
anyones O
looking O
to O
buy O
a O
computer O
or O
laptop O
you O
should O
stay O
far O
far O
away O
from O
any O
that O
have O
the O
name O
TOSHIBA O
on O
it O
. O

I O
' O
m O
an O
excellent O
touch O
typist O
, O
and O
my O
hands O
are O
very O
sensitive O
, O
too O
. O

This O
time O
the O
mouse B-AS
pad I-AS
and O
right B-AS
click I-AS
key I-AS
would O
n't O
work O
! O

EVENTUALLY O
we O
pushed O
hard O
enough O
to O
convince O
them O
that O
this O
was O
the O
MACHINE O
that O
was O
causing O
the O
problems O
. O

The O
first O
full B-AS
charge I-AS
of O
this O
battery B-AS
got O
me O
only O
about O
2 O
full O
hours O
. O

I O
bought O
a O
cordless B-AS
mouse I-AS
for O
it O
, O
but O
do O
n't O
always O
take O
it O
out O
; O

When O
I O
got O
it O
, O
I O
immediately O
noticed O
that O
it O
was O
quite O
heavy O
and O
thick O
and O
not O
really O
attractive O
. O

It O
is O
sleek O
, O
smooth O
, O
and O
lightweight O
. O

i O
am O
a O
huge O
computer O
person O
i O
love O
anykind O
of O
computer O
that O
works O
well O
, O
but O
when O
i O
got O
this O
one O
i O
was O
so O
happy O
with O
the O
way O
it O
works O
and O
how O
it O
runs B-AS
its O
amazing O
. O

It O
took O
Toshiba B-AS
tech I-AS
support I-AS
4 O
calls O
and O
4 O
different O
techs B-AS
to O
correct O
the O
problem O
. O

They O
only O
stay O
charged B-AS
a O
little O
over O
an O
hour O
. O

Now O
they O
are O
believers O
in O
the O
product O
. O

Had O
to O
have O
this O
computer O
repaired O
twice O
in O
the O
first O
5 O
months O
after O
purchasing O
it O
. O

Hewlett O
Packard O
HP O
Pavillion O
DV6000 O
Laptop O
is O
the O
worst O
laptop O
we O
have O
ever O
bought O
. O

I O
had O
never O
owned O
a O
Mac O
before O
; O

The O
4 O
USB O
ports O
are O
nice O
, O
but O
the O
two O
on O
the O
side O
only O
work O
now O
and O
then O
. O

I O
could O
not O
find O
a O
phone O
number O
anywhere O
to O
call O
an O
actual O
live O
person O
for O
tech B-AS
support I-AS
and O
had O
to O
result O
the O
their O
online B-AS
chat I-AS
. O

i O
try O
to O
use O
it O
today O
and O
I O
ca O
n't O
logon O
. O

Keyboard B-AS
could O
use O
some O
trimming O
. O

The O
bottom O
- O
line O
is O
that O
this O
laptop O
just O
is O
n't O
worth O
it O
. O

I O
returned O
the O
computer O
to O
HP O
and O
they O
kept O
it O
for O
3 O
months O
. O

Its O
white O
color B-AS
is O
stylish O
for O
college O
students O
and O
easy O
to O
take O
to O
carry O
and O
take O
to O
classes O
. O

Returned O
laptop O
for O
repair O
a O
2nd O
time O
and O
it O
came O
back O
with O
obvious O
physical O
damage O
keyboard B-AS
bulging O
and O
speaker B-AS
grill I-AS
pressed O
in O
, O
buttons B-AS
not O
working O
and O
USB B-AS
ports I-AS
inoperative O
. O

When O
I O
am O
next O
to O
my O
router O
on O
my O
HP O
I O
get O
full O
service O
, O
on O
my O
Eee O
PC O
I O
get O
3 O
bars O
. O

I O
got O
assurances O
from O
2 O
different O
people O
that O
the O
remaining O
10 O
months O
of O
my O
warranty B-AS
would O
transfer O
to O
the O
new O
computer O
. O

Pretty O
disappointed O
about O
this O
product O
. O

The O
letter B-AS
A I-AS
stopped O
working O
after O
the O
first O
week O
. O

By O
the O
time O
I O
was O
finally O
able O
to O
get O
a O
work O
order O
to O
get O
it O
fixed O
I O
had O
been O
without O
my O
computer O
for O
almost O
a O
week O
while O
I O
was O
an O
Online O
College O
Student O
, O
so O
it O
was O
very O
inconvenient O
and O
I O
had O
to O
send O
it O
off O
and O
be O
without O
it O
while O
it O
was O
being O
fixed O
also O
. O

It O
out O
performs O
any O
other O
laptop O
on O
the O
market O
today O
. O

This O
is O
what O
I O
call O
a O
good O
after B-AS
sales I-AS
service I-AS
. O

Maybe O
it O
's O
Acer O
, O
maybe O
it O
's O
MSFT O
. O

So O
if O
you O
want O
a O
good O
machine O
that O
does O
almost O
anything O
this O
is O
the O
one O
, O
if O
you O
want O
a O
low O
budget O
computer O
then O
look O
at O
the O
other O
great O
brands O
Best O
Buy O
sells O
. O

I O
took O
off O
a O
star O
because O
the O
machine O
has O
a O
lot O
of O
junk O
software B-AS
on O
it O
. O

I O
would O
buy O
one O
of O
these O
for O
every O
person O
in O
my O
office O
if O
I O
could O
. O

With O
what O
I O
do O
know O
how O
to O
do O
, O
the O
computer O
works B-AS
beautiful O
. O

HAVING O
HAD O
EXPERIENCE O
WITH O
A O
TOSHIBA O
LAPTOP O

I O
WAS O
DISAPPOINTED O
TO O
FIND O
THAT O
THE O
TOSHIBA O
NB305 O
LAPTOP O
HAS O
MAJOR O
PROBLEMS O
. O

Tried O
to O
make O
a O

I O

For O
the O

price B-AS
, O
you O
get O
a O
lot O
more O
in O
the O

I O
made O
a O
photo O
book O
as O
a O
gift O
, O
on O
my O
computer O
, O
pushed O
Buy O
and O
it O
drew O
from O
my O
iTunes B-AS
account O
and O
sent O
the O
book O
to O
my O
house O
, O
the O
book O
was O
of O
perfect O
quality O
- O
exactly O
how O
I O
had O
created O
it O
and O
looked O
better O
than O
I O
had O
even O
imagined O
. O

I O
use O
this O
for O
my O
tutoring O
business O
, O
and O
since O
I O
' O
m O
always O
bouncing O
from O
student O
to O

, O
it O
is O
ideal O
for O

yes O
, O
it O
gets O
the O
8 O

advertised O
! O
. O

It O
is O
in O
the O
best O
condition O
and O
has O
a O
really O

When O
it O
come O

you O
do O
n't O
matter O

At O

those O

very O
very O
slow O

I O
' O
m O
going O
back O
to O

With O
what O
I O
paid O
for O
this O
computer O
it O
should O
have O
had O
everything O
on O
it O

Apple O

always O
great O
about O
the O

of O
things O

they O
always O
come O
up O
with O
good O

I O

looking O
for O
a O

Runs B-AS

and O
quick O

Not O
a O
bad O
laptop O
, O
it O
's O
a O
bit O
slow O
, O
but O
gets O
the O
job O

Honestly O
, O
I O
spent O
more O
time O
waiting O
for O
it O

unfreeze O

actually O
doing O
what O
I O
got O
on O
there O
for O

This O
a O

notebook O

No O
I O
am O
generous O
calling O
it O
slow O

The O
downside O
to O
this O
netbook O
is O
pretty O
much O
the O
same O
for O
any O
netbook O
, O
screen B-AS
size I-AS
is O
not O
something O

stare O

the O
entire O
10 O

11 O
hours O
of O

life I-AS
five O
days O

All O

definitely O
recommend O
this O

for O
nearly O
everyone O

in O
5 O
months O
the O

quality I-AS
got O
worse O
and O

The O
big O
screen B-AS
allows O
you O
to O
enjoy O
watching O
movies O
, O
pictures O
and O

the O
headphone B-AS

not O

I O
have O

at O
least O
eight O
Toshiba O
laptops O
, O
and O
they O
have O
been O
outstanding O
, O
including O
this O
one O
. O

I O
called O
back O
to O
ensure O
that O
received O
it O
, O
they O
had O
. O

the O
manufacturer O
's O
warranty B-AS
only O
covers O
replacement O
/ O
repair O

What O
I O
'd O
like O
is O
for O
the O
laptop O
to O
run B-AS
well O
without O
having O
to O
purchase O
additional O
memory B-AS
. O

If O
you O
can O
afford O
a O
new O
laptop O
, O
and O
are O
in O
the O
market O
for O
one O
, O
of O
course O
, O
then O
definitely O
go O
for O
this O
. O

Got O
the O
computer O
back O
a O
month O
later O
and O
it O
was O
still O
broken O
sent O
it O
out O
again O
and O
they O
repaired O
it O
. O

It O
works B-AS
exactly O
like O
it O
did O
the O
day O
I O
took O
it O
out O
of O
the O
box O
. O

Now O
, O
the O
next O
issue O
I O
had O
freaked O
me O
out O
. O

i O
love O
ths O
notebook O
. O

It O
is O
fast O
booting B-AS
up I-AS
, O
shutting B-AS
down I-AS
, O
and O
connection B-AS
with I-AS
the I-AS
internet I-AS
. O

The O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
is O
great O
. O

This O
is O
not O
a O
serious O
gaming B-AS
laptop O
or O
a O
serious O
media O
machine O
; O

Even O
if O
Apple O
replaces O
whatever O
needs O
replacing O
I O
wonder O
if O
, O
since O
I O
seem O
to O
be O
doubling O
the O
amount O
of O
time O
I O
get O
out O
of O
it O
each O
time O
it O
's O
like O
new O
, O
I O
might O
have O
8 O
months O
next O
time O
. O

I O
got O
this O
laptop O
on O
Black O
Friday O
. O

They O
replaced O
my O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
as O
well O
as O
my O
mother B-AS
board I-AS
. O

I O
fell O
in O
love O
with O
it O
. O

It O
was O
just O
one O
problem O
after O
another O
for O
me O
, O
and O
that O
's O
reason O
we O
had O
forked O
out O
so O
much O
money O
was O
so O
we O
would O
n't O
have O
anything O
to O
worry O
about O
. O

There O
is O
nothing O
to O
complain O
about O
the O
system B-AS
. O

and O
it O
comes O
with O
the O
new O
OSX B-AS
that O
comes O
with O
new O
features B-AS
that O
makes O
the O
use B-AS
more O
easy O
. O

Maybe O
not O
the O
cutting O
edge O
Satellite O
L455D O
but O
it O
is O
a O
workhorse O
. O

But O
the O
Macbook O
is O
the O
best O
! O

Now O
the O
screen B-AS
is O
going O
darker O
, O
darker O
, O
darker O

EITHER O

it O

still O
love O
to O

Features B-AS

This O

is O
the O

Both O

started O
acting O
extremely O
slow O
within O
the O
first O
year O
of O
owning O
them O

The O
MacBook O
Pro O
is O
very O
sturdy O
and O
versatile O

when O
i O
called O
to O
have O
another O
one O
shipped O
or O
to O
get O
my O
money O
back O
they O
said O
the O

is O
23 O
twenty O
three O

from O
the O

of O

BOUGHT O
FROM O
WAL O
- O
MART O
, O
I O
BELIEVE O
THAT O
THIS O
LAPTOP O
WAS O
A O
REPAIRED O
ITEM O
. O

Could O
nt O
not O
use O
it O
. O

I O
sent O
it O
back O
and O
found O
this O
time O
that O
the O
battery B-AS
was O
faulty O
, O
so O
I O
got O
a O
new O
one O
and O
some O
other O
fixes O
they O
found O
. O

I O
swear O
they O
design O
these O
things O
to O
go O
to O
crap O
after O
a O
year O
so O
you O
are O
stuck O
and O
have O
to O
buy O
a O
new O
one O
. O

Great O
pick O
for O

. O

It O
's O
fast O
, O
it O
's O
easy O
easy O
easy O
to O
set B-AS
up I-AS
, O
easy O
to O
hook B-AS
to I-AS
my I-AS
wireless I-AS
network I-AS
. O

I O
previously O
purchased O
a O
13 O
macbook O
had O
pro O
specs B-AS
and O
was O
aluminum B-AS
style I-AS
which O
had O
a O
nvidia B-AS
9800 I-AS
If O
I O
am O
not O
mistaken O
and O
it O
had O
major O
heating O
issues O
. O

They O
did O
n't O
even O
try O
to O
assist O
me O
or O
even O
offer O
a O
replacement O
. O

We O
used O
PC O
products O
, O
it O
seemed O
simpler O
to O
continue O
with O
the O
same O
thing O
. O

The O
people O
there O
just O
changed O
for O
me O
on O
the O
spot O
and O
I O
got O
a O
new O
arm B-AS
piece I-AS
and O
they O
did O
n't O
even O
request O
for O
a O
receipt O
. O

I O
love O
my O
Samsung O
TV O
and O
Galaxy O
S O
smartphone O
, O
but O
this O
Netbook O
was O
a O
very O
poor O
computer O
. O

I O
made O
a O
perfect O
decision O
when O
I O
bought O
the O
Toshiba O
! O

I O
take O
it O
everywhere O
with O
me O
because O
it O
's O
so O
easy O
to O
carry B-AS
. O

The O
only O
thing O
is O
that O
the O
battery B-AS
wo O
n't O
last O
more O
than O
1/2 O
an O
hour O
. O

It O
still O
heats O
up O
like O
mad O
and O
I O
am O
unable O
to O
use O
it O
with O
the O
computer O
directly O
on O
my O
lap O
for O
more O
than O
five O
to O
ten O
minutes O
at O
a O
time O
. O

The O
first O
fell O
apart O
right O
after O
the O
1-year B-AS
- I-AS
warranty I-AS
. O

I O
am O
finding O
my O
way O
around O
this O
laptop O
better O
than O
my O
last O
one O
. O

They O
told O
me O
it O
was O
my O
loss O
even O
though O
it O
was O
the O
computer O
, O
not O
what O
I O
' O
ve O
done O
. O

I O
would O
Highly O
recommend O
this O
MacBook O
. O

About O
2 O
months O
ago O
i O
bought O
the O
2011 O
macbook O
pro O
, O
which O
was O
an O
upgrade O
from O
my O
2010 O
macbook O
pro O
. O

Let O
's O
just O
get O
this O
out O
of O
the O
way O
, O
I O
love O
Apple O
! O

Oh O
and O
it O
has O
word O
and O
stuff O
but O
its O
a O
trial O
verion O
so O
after O
about O
a O
month O
or O
so O
when O
you O
go O
to O
open O
it O
it O
asks O
for O
a O
product O
key O
which O
did O
n't O
come O
with O
the O
computer O
and O
even O
after O
clicking O
cancel O
it O
wo O
nt O
let O
you O
use O
it O
at O
all O
I O
use O
the O
old O
word B-AS
processer I-AS
which O
works O
good O
. O

The O
keyboard B-AS
has O
a O
wonderful O
nature O
feel O
. O

They O
went O
through O
asking O
me O
open O
up O
various O
components O
, O
taking O
battery B-AS
out O
, O
hard B-AS
disk I-AS
apart O
, O
and O
after O
2 O
hours O
on O
phone O
could O
not O
fix O
it O
. O

* O
4 O
weeks O
after O
giving O
the O
computer O
for O
repair*-Annoyed O
at O
MacHouse O
Amsterdam O
, O
decided O
to O
send O
complaint O
email O
to O
Apple O
. O

While O
there O
are O
occasions O
that O
my O
computer O
will O
freeze O
or O
will O
need O
to O
be O
manually O
shut O
down O
, O
this O
occurs O
far O
less O
frequently O
than O
on O
PC O
computers O
and O
laptops O
that O
I O
' O
ve O
used O
. O

Bought O
with O
a O
credit O
card O
. O

The O
battery B-AS
does O
n't O
last O
long O
but O
I O
' O
m O
sure O
an O
upgrade O
battery B-AS
would O
solve O
that O
problem O
. O

I O
was O
looking O
too O
closely O
at O
the O
other O
performance B-AS
specs I-AS
and O
while O
comparing O
, O
I O
took O
it O
for O
granted O
that O
these O
features B-AS
were O
standard O
. O

I O
did O
a O
lot O
of O
research O
and O
ended O
up O
thinking O
this O
Toshiba O
was O
the O
best O
one O
for O
me O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
had O
it O
now O
about O
2 O
months O
and O
absolutely O
LOVE O
IT O
. O

I O
have O
no O
idea O
how O
this O
could O
have O
even O
gotten O
past O
quality B-AS
control I-AS
during O
production O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
last O
week O
, O
and O
the O
very O
next O
day O
had O
to O
return O
it O
because O
it O
over O
heated O
and O
the O
touch B-AS
- I-AS
mouse I-AS
stopped O
responding O
. O

I O
am O
so O
happy O
to O
have O
purchased O
this O
computer O
. O

Oh O
yea O
, O
has O
no O
numeric B-AS
pad I-AS
on O
the O
side O
. O

The O
cover B-AS
for I-AS
the I-AS
DVD I-AS
drive I-AS
soon O
came O
off O
, O
too O
-- O
a O
mark O
of O
poor O
construction B-AS
quality I-AS
. O

I O
returned O
the O
2nd O
laptop O
for O
a O
full O
refund O
. O

really O
no O
problems O
with O
the O
hand O
me O
down O
computers O
I O
received O
from O
my O
children O
. O

I O
did O
not O
take O
the O
class O
and O
wish O
that O
I O
would O
have O
. O

It O
would O
be O
a O
load O
on O
long O
trips O
where O
a O
lot O
of O
walking O
is O
required O
. O

But O
the O
arm B-AS
velcro I-AS
is O
torn O
after O
one O
use O
. O

Not O
good O
for O
a O
person O
who O
gets O
online O
daily O
. O

The O
laptop O
was O
returned O
but O
audio O
issue O
was O
not O
fixed O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
even O
remember O
how O
I O
finally O
got O
it O
taken O
care O
of O
, O
but O
I O
was O
done O
with O
Sony O
after O
that O
! O

So O
it O
was O
only O
about O
2 O
weeks O
ago O
. O

I O
just O
love O
this O
lap O
top O
, O
I O
just O
wish O
it O
were O
all O
silver O
or O
they O
had O
all O
black O
. O

The O
software B-AS
is O
amazing O
. O

We O
carry O
the O
netbook O
around O
here O
and O
there O
, O
hence O
it O
's O
kinda O
of O
irritating O
when O
the O
LCD B-AS
just O
slide O
downwards O
. O

There O
is O
nothing O
better O
. O

I O
now O
own O
another O
Hewlitt O
Packard O
. O

The O
2 B-AS
GB I-AS
of I-AS
RAM I-AS
is O
plenty O
, O
able O
to O
run O
Windows B-AS
7 I-AS
and O
at O
least O
2 O
or O
3 O
other O
programs B-AS
with O
next O
to O
no O
slowdown O
. O

The O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
is O
amazing O
, O
the O
versitility B-AS
is O
outstanding O
. O

It O
is O
known O
as O
Safari B-AS
, O
and O
if O
you O
are O
doing O
any O
website O
work O
, O
you O
should O
know O
that O
many O
hosting O
companies O
do O
not O
support O
it O
. O

Vista B-AS
is O
a O
nightmare O
. O

i O
spent O
eight O
hundred O
dollars O
from O
a O
giant O
paper O
weight O
that O
looks O
good O
on O
a O
bus O
. O

I O
have O
used O
a O
couple O
of O
others O
on O
the O
job O
as O
well O
. O

The O
program B-AS
came O
with O
the O
computer O
and O
works O
beautifully O
. O

Posted O
Nov O

, O
2010 O
, O
Two O
weeks O
ago O
I O
bought O
this O
notebook O
. O

Acer O
wo O
n't O
replace O
the O
laptop O
. O

I O
am O
also O
upset O
with O
CR O
for O
giving O
a O
good O
rating O
. O

the O
hinge B-AS
design I-AS
forced O
you O
to O
place O
various O
connections O
all O
around O
the O
computer O
, O
left O
right O
and O
front O
. O

I O
have O
owned O
macbook O
pros O
since O
2005 O
and O
this O
is O
the O
best O
yet O
! O

I O
was O
loving O
this O
Netbook O
because O
it O
had O
an O
amazing O
screen B-AS
and O
display B-AS
and O
was O
small O
and O
light O
, O
but O
after O
1 O
week O
it O
stopped O
openning O
web O
pages O
for O
me O
even O
after O
installing O
new O
browsers B-AS
then O
eventually O
it O
just O
started O
giving O
me O
a O
blue O
screen B-AS
and O
crashing O
everytime O
I O
booted O
it O
. O

Now O
I O
could O
get O
myself O
a O
cheap O
computer O
, O
that O
will O
probably O
work O
a O
whole O
lot O
better O
! O

I O
would O
definitely O
not O
go O
back O
to O
using O
a O
PC O
after O
using O
the O
mac O
. O

The O
So O
called O
laptop O
Runs B-AS
to O
Slow O
and O
I O
hate O
it O
! O

This O
is O
the O
first O
laptop O
I O
' O
ve O
owned O
, O
althougth O
I O
used O
several O
at O
my O
previous O
job O
. O

Those O
moments O
in O
thime O
where O
you O
want O
to O
throw O
something O
against O
the O
wall O
? O
Yeah O
, O
I O
wanted O
to O
throw O
that O
lap O
top O
out O
the O
window O
and O
light O
it O
on O
fire O
. O

Charger B-AS
seems O
large O
for O
this O
class O
of O
computer O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
really O
have O
a O
complaint O
. O

I O
' O
m O
pretty O
sure O
it O
's O
not O
newegg O
's O
fault O
but O
when O
you O
turn O
on O
a O
computer O
you O
just O
bought O
you O
want O
it O
to O
at O
least O
get O
to O
desktop O
. O

Best O
Buy O
ended O
up O
junking O
the O
computer O
and O
giving O
me O
a O
replacement O
computer O
. O

I O
dislike O
the O
quality O
and O
the O
placement O
of O
the O
speakers B-AS
. O

The O
screen B-AS
graphics I-AS
and O
clarity B-AS
, O
and O
sharpness B-AS
are O
great O
. O

If O
I O
have O
a O
problem O
with O
any O
of O
my O
apple O
items O
I O
make O
an O
appointment O
at O
one O
of O
my O
local O
stores O
and O
they O
work O
on O
correcting O
it O
right O
there O
. O

So O
I O
called O
customer B-AS
support I-AS
which O
is O
good O
too O
and O
they O
went O
through O
it O
and O
it O
is O
just O
a O
safety B-AS
feature I-AS
and O
it O
does O
not O
affect O
performance B-AS
at O
all O
, O
I O
just O
chose O
to O
hide O
the O
message O
. O

I O
claim O
that O
this O
has O
no O
value O
to O
me O
, O
the O
laptop O
was O
new O
anyway O
. O

Enough O
said O
. O

Not O
working O
bad O

i O
would O
really O
recommend O
to O
any O
person O
out O
there O
to O
get O
this O
laptop O
cause O
its O
really O
worth O
it O
. O

Otherwise O
this O
little O
notebook O
has O
met O
all O
my O
expectations O
. O

My O
son O
said O
it O
popped O
up O
and O
he O
clicked O
update O
. O

I O
lost O
two O
items O
I O
was O
working O
on O
until O
I O
figured O
out O
what O
was O
happening O
. O

The O
unibody B-AS
design I-AS
is O
edgy O
and O
durable O
. O

STOPPED O
BOOTING B-AS
UP I-AS
less O
than O
a O
week O
after O
my O
one B-AS
- I-AS
year I-AS
warranty I-AS
was O
up O
. O

But O
, O
for O
the O
cost B-AS
this O
is O
a O
winner O
. O

Let O
me O
tell O
you O
, O
this O
machine O
is O
great O
. O

I O
have O
used O
a O
computer O
at O
work O
but O
having O
your O
own O
personal O
laptop O
is O
AWSOME O
! O

Later O
it O
held O
zero O
charge B-AS
and O
its O
replacement O
worked O
for O
less O
than O
three O
months O
. O

The O
second O
issue O
I O
had O
with O
it O
occured O
a O
month O
later O
and O
it O
kept O
overheating O
, O
even O
if O
on O
for O
less O
than O
an O
hour O
! O

Also O
, O
the O
battery B-AS
does O
not O
last O
very O
long O
at O
all O
. O

Good O
luck O
with O
your O
purchase O
options O
. O

Buy O
this O
if O
you O
like O
being O
tortured O
, O
teased O
, O
frustrated O
and O
wasting O
twice O
as O
much O
time O
as O
you O
spent O
using O
your O
old O
Mac O
. O

Very O
disappointed O
! O

They O
are O
asking O
me O
to O
ship O
the O
unit O
back O
to O
fix O
it O
at O
their O
site O
. O

I O
bought O
it O
from O
HSN O
because O
it O
was O
bundled O
with O
extra O
software B-AS
, O
but O
as O
it O
turns O
out O
, O
that O
software B-AS
just O
crashes O
it O
more O
often O
. O

I O
looked O
around O
and O
based O
off O
my O
price B-AS
comparison O
from O
a O
brand O
I O
trusted O
I O
landed O
here O
. O

I O
constantly O
had O
to O
send O
my O
laptop O
in O
for O
services B-AS
every O
3 O
months O
and O
it O
always O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
same O
problem O
that O
they O
said O
they O
had O
already O
fixed O
. O

Strong O
performance B-AS
in O
this O
device O
makes O
use B-AS
of O
fun O
and O
a O
strong O
sense O
of O
the O
era O
of O
speed B-AS
This O
device O
serves O
all O
modern O
requirements O
is O
a O
very O
strong O
game O
and O
is O
very O
use B-AS
for O
designers O
. O

Unless O
you O
need O
the O
Bluetooth B-AS
3 I-AS
. O

I O
was O
sorly O
disapointed O
to O
discover O
that O
HP O
what O
I O
thought O
was O
a O
reputable O
company O
would O
n't O
honor O
the O
warrenty B-AS
when O
the O
fan B-AS
blade I-AS
fell O
apart O
. O

That O
is O
pretty O
sad O
when O
they O
name O
them O
specifically O
. O

More O
times O
that O
not O
the O
screen O
pops O
up O
saying O
I O
have O
a O
bad O
internet B-AS
connection I-AS
, O
or O
the O
page O
ca O
n't O
be O
displayed O
. O

No O
viruses O
. O

It O
is O
everything O
that O
I O
would O
want O
in O
a O
computer O
. O

Do O
yourself O
a O
favor O
and O
invest O
in O
a O
few O
external B-AS
harddrives I-AS
if O
you O
are O
planning O
on O
purchasing O
this O
laptop O
. O

However O
, O
If O
I O
sound O
enthusiastic O
about O
this O
, O
I O
am O
! O

You O
will O
fall O
in O
love O
with O
it O
in O
no O
time O
. O

i O
give O
this O
laptop O
a O
five O
star O
review O
i O
love O
it O
and O
it O
has O
done O
chams O
for O
me O
. O

They O
removed O
them O
and O
returned O
the O
computer O
to O
me O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
understand O
why O
only O
Windows B-AS
7 I-AS
Starter I-AS
is O
included O
. O

On O
3 O
July O
2004 O
, O
I O
purcased O
this O
model O
at O
Best O
Buy O
for O
about O
$ O
150 O

I O
went O
with O
him O
and O
we O
picked O
this O
one O
. O

While O
most O
people O
say O
that O
PCs O
hold O
functionality B-AS
and O
value B-AS
and O
Macs O
are O
just O
pretty O
to O
look B-AS
at O
, O
I O
think O
there O
's O
something O
to O
be O
said O
about O
the O
simplicity B-AS
of O
Macs O
. O

This O
is O
my O
second O
MACBOOK O
PRO O
and O
it O
's O
better O
than O
ever O
. O

My O
macbook O
is O
so O
much O
better O
looking B-AS
and O
so O
thin O
! O

The O
notebook O
would O
not O
turn O
back O
on O
again O
. O

The O
ease O
of O
use B-AS
is O
wonderful O
. O

This O
system O
came O
loaded O
with O
Windows B-AS
7 I-AS
Starter I-AS
. O

-When O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
went O
to O
4 O
hours O
or O
less O
, O
took O
it O
to O
the O
MacHouse O
Amsterdam O
for O
repair O
26th O
of O
August O
. O

The O
battery B-AS
gets O
so O
HOT O
it O
is O
scary O
. O

Best O
thing O
is O
I O
can O
use O
existing O
32 O
bit O
old O
programs B-AS
. O

It O
's O
so O
nice O
to O
look B-AS
at O
and O
the O
keys B-AS
are O
easy O
to O
type O
with O
. O

The O
apple O
macbook O
pro O
nothing O
to O
say O
butprofessionally O
great O
and O
outstanding O
. O

It O
's O
also O
very O
energy O
efficient O
, O
running O
on O
a O
quarter O
of O
the O
power O
it O
takes O
to O
run O
a O
60 O
Watt O
lightbulb O
. O

I O
am O
forever O
changed O
and O
will O
no O
longer O
buy O
a O
Windows B-AS
based O
machine O
for O
personal O
use O
. O

Mom O
, O
Dad O
, O
Brother O
, O
sister O
, O
You O
name O
it O
! O

but O
it O
came O
back O
in O
even O
worse O
shape O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
would O
change O
about O
it O
is O
the O
mouse B-AS
keys I-AS
. O

It O
is O
absolutely O
horrible O
to O
use B-AS
, O
despite O
all O
its O
so O
called O
advanced O
features B-AS
. O

Before O
, O
I O
reloaded O
with O
Windows B-AS
7 I-AS
Ultimate I-AS
and O
used O
only O
the O
downloaded O
drivers B-AS
from O
Acer O
's O
site O
. O

I O
have O
to O
keep O
turning O
it O
until O
it O
decides O
to O
lower O
and O
there O
is O
no O
mute B-AS
. O

It O
's O
still O
beautiful O
and O
has O
better O
color B-AS
reproduction I-AS
than O
I O
could O
ever O
expect O
from O
a O
notebook O
. O

After O
that O
I O
turned O
to O
email O
in O
my O
next O
vain O
help O
to O
get O
them O
to O
acknowledge O
that O
the O
warranty B-AS
was O
still O
valid O
. O

So O
far O
, O
a O
great O
product O
. O

He O
loves O
it O
and O
it O
is O
easy O
to O
use B-AS
and O
well O
the O
schools O
start O
teaching O
the O
kids O
early O
about O
computers O
so O
it O
was O
easy O
for O
him O
to O
get O
started O
. O

u O
can O
do O
what O
u O
want O
in O
just O
few O
seconds O
, O
even O
to O
start B-AS
up I-AS
your O
computer O
takes O
few O
seconds O
. O

It O
's O
the O
most O
wonderful O
thing O
in O
the O
entire O
world O
. O

So O
I O
'd O
pop O
them O
off O
to O
see O
what O
the O
problem O
was O
, O
well O
guess O
what O
? O
The O
darn O
thing O
would O
n't O
go O
back O
on O
. O

Also O
, O
macbooks O
come O
with O
much O
more O
features B-AS
which O
are O
so O
cool O
! O

They O
sent O
out O
a O
Sony B-AS
' I-AS
Certified I-AS
' I-AS
technician I-AS
. O

They O
have O
developed O
excellent O
proprietary B-AS
software I-AS
for O
editing O
video O
and O
pictures O
and O
I O
' O
m O
looking O
forward O
to O
utilizing O
these O
tools O
on O
the O
regular O
. O

Getting O
the O
Apple B-AS
Care I-AS
plan I-AS
is O
a O
must O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
saved O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
and O
headaches O
so O
far O
, O
using O
my O
new O
MacBook O
Pro O
. O

overall O
i O
would O
recomend O
this O
to O
anybody O
and O
tell O
them O
that O
if O
they O
want O
to O
burn O
their O
music O
or O
play O
there O
video B-AS
games I-AS
to O
buy O
the O
cd B-AS
drive I-AS
. O

-Apple O
offers O
to O
send O
replacement O
and O
after O
10 O
days O
I O
send O
them O
the O
old O
computer O
. O

So O
far O
, O
I O
have O
no O
complaints O
. O

His O
was O
worth O
$ O
36 O
. O

NOW O
AM O
VERY O
APREHENSIVE O
ABOUT O
TOSHIBA O
LAPTOPS O
. O

I O
spent O
2200 O
dollars O
on O
a O
top O
of O
the O
line O
laptop O
. O

I O
also O
own O
an O
HP O
notebook O
and O
it O
does O
n't O
even O
come O
close O
. O

Our O
Apple O
133 O
MacBook O
Pro O
Notebook O
Computer O
Z0J80001 O
Notebook O
and O
has O
become O
such O
an O
integral O
part O
of O
completing O
our O
daily O
needs O
and O
social O
networking O
. O

I O
am O
constantly O
trying O
to O
uninstall O
programs B-AS
, O
clean O
cookies O
, O
and O
delete O
unused O
files O
. O

The O
dv4 O
boasted O
a O
faster O
processor B-AS
, O
more O
memory B-AS
, O
and O
a O
bigger O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
than O
my O
old O
computer O
, O
plus O
a O
better O
quality O
web B-AS
cam I-AS
, O
nicer O
screen B-AS
, O
and O
many O
other O
features B-AS
. O

The O
only O
downfall O
is O
the O
battery B-AS
only O
last O
15 O
- O
20 O
hrs O
when O
not O
plugged O
in O
. O

The O
graphics B-AS
on O
this O
computer O
are O
also O
stellar O
, O
very O
clear O
and O
vivid O
. O

Aside O
from O
the O
trial B-AS
software I-AS
and O
the O
short O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
, O
lack O
of O
a O
webcam B-AS
, O
its O
great O
. O

As O
a O
die O
- O
hard O
Windows B-AS
enthusiast O
, O
I O
shunned O
the O
idea O
of O
a O
Mac O
until O
this O
point O
. O

I O
think O
that O
if O
it O
is O
the O
motherboard B-AS
again O
so O
soon O
that O
they O
should O
replace O
it O
. O

if O
this O
computer O
every O
breaks O
down O
on O
me O
i O
will O
most O
definatly O
get O
the O
same O
one O
again O
. O

I O
had O
a O
MacBook O
Notebook O
, O
and O
it O
had O
absolutely O
no O
protection O
from O
viruses O
, O
spyware O
, O
malware O
, O
etc O
. O

The O
computer O
loads B-AS
in O
about O
a O
1/10th O
of O
the O
time O
that O
my O
PC O
did O
, O
and O
I O
have O
all O
of O
the O
programs B-AS
that O
were O
on O
my O
PC O
. O

I O
made O
the O
right O
decision O
. O

In O
the O
past O
few O
years O
, O
I O
' O
ve O
had O
terrible O
experiences O
with O
HP O
. O

Overall O
, O
it O
's O
ok O
. O

Graphics B-AS
are O
clean O
and O
sharp O
, O
internet B-AS
interfaces I-AS
are O
seamless O
. O

The O
newer O
black B-AS
keyboard I-AS
took O
a O
little O
bit O
away O
from O
the O
previous O
gray O
one O
which O
looked O
really O
slick O
, O
but O
it O
is O
still O
a O
great O
notebook O
! O

Sony O
parts O
reliability O
and O
quality O
of O
service B-AS
is O
recenlty O
the O
worst O
. O

I O
am O
very O
Happy O
! O

As O
with O
any O
laptop O
not O
purchased O
with O
software B-AS
options I-AS
, O
it O
comes O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
what O
I O
consider O
useless O
applications B-AS
. O

Its O
Office B-AS
compatible O
, O
but O
the O
features B-AS
and O
its O
functioning B-AS
is O
all O
new O
again O
so O
you O
might O
as O
well O
save O
the O
money O
and O
just O
learn O
the O
pre O
installed O
mac O
programs B-AS
. O

I O
occassionaly O
use O
it O
for O
work O
via O
VPN O
and O
it O
has O
not O
given O
me O
any O
problems O
. O

I O
sent O
it O
back O
AND O
THEY O
LOST O
IT O
. O

It O
just O
works B-AS
flawlessly O
! O

Do O
you O
think O
I O
purposely O
destroy O
my O
netbook O
, O
so O
that O
I O
can O
demand O
a O
new O
set O
? O
Do O
you O
think O
it O
's O
fun O
to O
take O
public O
transport O
all O
the O
way O
to O
the O
service B-AS
center I-AS
and O
get O
a O
non O
- O
satisfactory O
solution O
? O
Or O
rather O
NO O
solution O
. O

I O
' O
m O
having O
the O
laptop O
returned O
unrepaired O
since O
paying O
$ O
176 O
every O
3 O
months O
just O
is O
n't O
worth O
it O
that O
's O
about O
how O
long O
the O
port B-AS
seems O
to O
last O
. O

Ok O
first O
. O

So O
if O
you O
move O
laptop O
a O
lot O
, O
it O
might O
get O
loose O
, O
however O
it O
sits O
pretty O
tightly O
. O

another O
satisfied O
customer O
. O

also O
the O
battery B-AS
is O
completely O
shot O
. O

Highly O
recommended O
! O

/ O
awesome O
cooling B-AS
system I-AS
much O
better O
grafics B-AS
card I-AS
ATI O
5870 O
/ O
8 B-AS
GB I-AS
RAM I-AS
LED I-AS
backlit I-AS
screen I-AS
. O

The O
biggest O
problem O
is O
that O
the O
box O
had O
no O
instructions B-AS
in O
it O
. O

But O
after O
using O
it O
a O
couple O
of O
weeks O
, O
the O
overall O
operation B-AS
is O
poor O
. O

Will O
not O
buy O
another O
Toshiba O
, O
this O
is O
my O
second O
, O
not O
happy O
w/ O
either O
. O

Compared O
to O
similarly O
spec O
'd O
PCs O
, O
this O
machine O
is O
good O
value B-AS
, O
well O
built B-AS
and O
works B-AS
easily O
right O
out O
of O
the O
box O
. O

The O
cool O
thing O
about O
the O
Mac O
Book O
was O
that O
I O
went O
on O
my O
honeymoon O
and O
shot O
a O
bunch O
of O
pictures O
and O
movies O
with O
my O
iPhone O
, O
then O
I O
came O
back O
and O
put O
them O
onto O
my O
Macbook O
and O
made O
a O
pretty O
good O
DVD O
movie O
with O
all O
the O
pictures O
and O
videos O
from O
my O
trip O
. O

for O
two O
months O
, O
when O
YOU O
GUESSED O
IT O
. O

This O
was O
my O
first O
MacBook O
purchase O
ever O
. O

Screen B-AS
is O
crystal O
clear O
and O
the O
system B-AS
is O
very O
responsive O
. O

I O
will O
stack O
it O
up O
against O
laptops O
that O
cost O
twice O
as O
much O
any O
day O
. O

Quite O
simply O
this O
is O
the O
best O
laptop O
I O
have O
ever O
owned O
. O

Or O
the O
cursor B-AS
would O
show O
up O
some O
place O
else O
. O

The O
newer O
MacBook O
that O
I O
have O
purchased O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
computers O
. O

I O
have O
had O
some O
excellent O
computer O
and O
have O
found O
I O
had O
no O
idea O
what O
to O
do O
with O
them O

As O
it O
turns O
out O
, O
I O
just O
did O
n't O
know O
any O
better O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
had O
friends O
with O
Acers O
who O
seem O
to O
have O
had O
similar O
or O
exact O
same O
problems O
. O

What O
can O
I O
say O
. O

It O
is O
easy O
to O
operate B-AS
and O
I O
have O
already O
ordered O
more O
software B-AS
and O
gadgets B-AS
for O
my O
new O
Rolls O
Royce O
of O
laptops O
. O

What O
's O
also O
interesting O
is O
this O
survey O
changed O
my O
ratings O
the O
first O
time O
I O
submitted O
it O
in O
case O
it O
does O
n't O
keep O
what O
I O
put O
here O
are O
my O
aratings O

it O
might O
be O
something O
deep O
within O
Windows B-AS
, O
for O
I O
was O
unable O
to O
create O
a O
disk B-AS
image I-AS
on O
my O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
. O

I O
had O
a O
toshiba O
for O
10 O
years O
. O

The O
track B-AS
pad I-AS
to O
me O
is O
what O
really O
stands O
out O
though O
, O
you O
can O
do O
several O
different O
things O
with O
it O
just O
depending O
on O
how O
many O
fingers O
you O
use O
on O
the O
track B-AS
pad I-AS
, O
awesome O
thinking O
Apple O
! O

Now O
I O
had O
not O
tried O
to O
use O
this O
since O
the O
disc B-AS
drive I-AS
had O
been O
replaced O
and O
after O
taking O
it O
back O
to O
the O
Geek O
Squad O
I O
found O
out O
they O
had O
accidently O
not O
used O
the O
right O
drive B-AS
when O
they O
replaced O
the O
first O
one O
, O
so O
back O
it O
went O
to O
get O
the O
correct O
drive B-AS
. O

First O
, O
you O
ll O
discover O
that O
the O
word B-AS
processing I-AS
program I-AS
known O
as O
Appleworks B-AS
rarely O
translates O
perfectly O
on O
anyone O
else O
s O
computer O
, O
if O
it O
translates O
at O
all O
. O

she O
ca O
n't O
tell O
the O
difference O
between O
it O
and O
her O
regular O
desktop O
system O
. O

With O
in O
weeks O
of O
purchasing O
my O
computer O
is O
began O
to O
slow O
down O
. O

It O
does O
n't O
bother O
me O
though O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
had O
this O
laptop O
for O
about O
a O
month O
now O
. O

I O
already O
have O
a O
HP O
laptop O
I O
bought O
last O
year O
that O
's O
standard O
size B-AS
. O

It O
was O
okay O
for O
over O
a O
week O
before O
the O
blue O
screens O
started O
occuring O
again O
. O

English O
must O
have O
been O
his O
third O
or O
fourth O
language O
. O

Battery B-AS
is O
not O
upgradable O
to O
a O
longer O
life O
battery B-AS
. O

I O
am O
just O
ONE O
of O
the O
million O
customers O
. O

it O
has O
times O
were O
it O
freezes O
for O
10 O
seconds O
and O
then O
starts O
again O
. O

apple O
has O
a O
reputation O
and O
is O
well O
known O
for O
its O
easy O
usage B-AS
. O

Returned O
laptop O
for O
a O
3rd O
repair O
and O
it O
came O
back O
with O
previous O
problems O
fixed O
except O
for O
speaker B-AS
grill I-AS
but O
the O
unit O
started O
locking O
up O
during O
use O
and O
eventually O
would O
not O
operate O
at O
all O
. O

I O
just O
plug O
this O
into O
my O
22 B-AS
" I-AS
Monitor I-AS
and O
the O
speedy O
MacOSX B-AS
performs O
just O
as O
well O
on O
this O
dual B-AS
- I-AS
core I-AS
that O
my O
Dell O
did O
with O
Windows B-AS
7 I-AS
with O
a O
quad B-AS
- I-AS
core I-AS
. O

Love O
the O
graphics B-AS
, O
awesome O
programs B-AS
including O
Garageband B-AS
, O
and O
really O
cool O
default B-AS
background I-AS
. O

Screen B-AS
, O
keyboard B-AS
, O
and O
mouse B-AS
, O
If O
you O
ca O
n't O
see O
yourself O
spending O
the O
extra O
money O
to O
jump O
up O
to O
a O
Mac O
the O
beautiful O

, O
responsive O
island O
backlit O
keyboard B-AS
, O
and O
fun O
multi B-AS

is O
worth O
the O
extra O
money O
to O
me O
alone O
. O

I O
am O
taking O
back O
today O
. O

My O
parents O
bought O
it O
for O
me O
as O
a O
graduation O
gift O
, O
and O
i O
' O
m O
totally O
almost O
kind O
of O
maybe O
definitely O
obsessed O
with O
it O
. O

The O
MacBook O
is O
way O
too O
overpriced O
for O
something O
so O
simple O
and O
chaotic O
. O

-Complied O
to O
their O
protocol O
, O
called O
number O
, O
made O
case O
, O
got O
an O
email O
address O
to O
send O
complaint O
. O

The O
OS O
takes O
some O
getting O
used O
to O
especially O
after O
being O
a O
Windows B-AS
user O
for O
so O
long O
but O
the O
learning O
curve O
is O
so O
worth O
it O
! O

It O
quit O
working O
within O
a O
weeks O
time O
. O

but O
after O
i O
got O
used O
to O
it O
i O
love O
it O
. O

I O
also O
purchased O
iWork B-AS
to O
go O
with O
it O
which O
has O
programs B-AS
for O
word B-AS
processing I-AS
, O
spreadsheets B-AS
, O
and O
presentations B-AS
similar O
to O
Microsoft B-AS
Office I-AS
. O

After O
4 O
days O
, O
being O
denied O
6 O
times O
and O
told O
off O
once O
, O
I O
managed O
to O
get O
through O
and O
was O
able O
to O
send O
them O
a O
scanned O
copy O
of O
the O
receipt O
. O

Overall O
, O
I O
experienced O
a O
huge O
change O
in O
that O
my O
mac O
runs B-AS
pretty O
fast O
compared O
to O
my O
old O
PC O
. O

When O
I O
got O
the O
computer O
back O
and O
realizwed O
it O
still O
was O
not O
correct O
HP O
told O
me O
it O
was O
out O
of O
warranty B-AS
and O
now O
it O
was O
my O
problem O
. O

It O
also O
came O
with O
a O
built B-AS
it I-AS
web I-AS
cam I-AS
which O
is O
great O
because O
I O
can O
see O
an O
communicate O
with O
my O
family O
members O
back O
home O
. O

Good O
monitor B-AS
and O
performed B-AS
well O
. O

They O
are O
closed O
at O
9 O
pm O
eastern O
. O

In O
those O
three O
years O
, O
I O
' O
ve O
had O
a O
couple O
of O
minor O
problems O
and O
both O
were O
resolved O
by O
Apple O
quickly O
and O
easily O
. O

Although O
my O
model O
was O
listed O
as O
recalled O
, O
HP O
denied O
my O
claim O
. O

It O
was O
secure O
and O
easy O
to O
navigate B-AS
. O

I O
was O
a O
little O
weary O
at O
purchasing O
another O
13 O
macbook O
almost O
2 O
years O
later O
but O
t O
looks O
like O
the O
newer O
macbooks O
have O
gotten O
its O
current O
line O
of O
graphics B-AS
cards I-AS
in O
order O
this O
time O
around O
. O

The O
machine O
has O
a O
bluray B-AS
player I-AS
the O
book B-AS
has O
no O
mention O
of O
it O
or O
how O
to O
connect O
it O
to O
your O
HDTV O
. O

I O
am O
loyal O
to O
Apple O
. O

They O
are O
by O
far O
the O
easiest O
systems B-AS
to O
actually O
learn O
about O
computers O
with O
. O

I O
will O
be O
patient O
for O
few O
months O
. O

this O
apple O
navigates O
you O
thru O
the O
unexplored O
world O
of O
the O
internet B-AS
. O

This O
was O
purchased O
for O
my O
daughter O
and O
I O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised O
. O

Finally O
set O
the O
unit O
back O
to O
HP O
after O
a O
month O
of O
hell O
. O

I O
could O
n't O
afford O
a O
new O
mac O
, O
so O
I O
bought O
a O
PC O
instead O
. O

The O
video O
card O
is O
great O
for O
media B-AS
, O
and O
above O
average O
for O
gaming B-AS
, O
but O
not O
a O
gamers O
first O
choice O
. O

It O
was O
always O
getting O
froze O
up O
. O

my O
information O
was O
all O
lost O
my O
fault O
, O
I O
know O
, O
but O
I O
never O
thought O
I O
would O
need O
to O
back O
up O
my O
information O
on O
a O
brand O
new O
Mac O
, O
the O
paragon O
of O
all O
computers O
! O

But O
no O
one O
could O
tell O
me O
when O
my O
part O
would O
be O
shipped O
nor O
could O
they O
tell O
me O
where O
to O
buy O
it O
ON O
THEIR O
WEBSITE O
! O
! O
! O

I O
got O
the O
blue O
screen O
of O
death O
the O
first O
month O
I O
got O
it O
. O

This O
is O
the O
third O
MacBook O
Pro O
in O
our O
family O
. O

Apple O
continues O
to O
shine O
and O
provide O
a O
much O
more O
enjoyable O
computer O
experience O
! O

I O
had O
of O
course O
bought O
a O
3 B-AS
year I-AS
warranty I-AS
, O
so O
I O
sent O
it O
in O
to O
be O
replaced O
and O
almost O
2 O
months O
later O
the O
dv4 O
is O
what O
the O
sent O
me O
as O
a O
replacement O
. O

Apparently O
there O
is O
a O
manufacturing O
defect O
, O
something O
with O
the O
amount O
of O
thermal B-AS
paste I-AS
. O

Despite O
the O
claims O
of O
the O
Apple O
apologists O
a O
vice O
of O
which O
I O
am O
recently O
myself O
reformed O
the O
internals B-AS
of O
Mac O
laptops O
are O
NO O
different O
from O
PCs O
at O
this O
point O
. O

Took O
several O
hours O
with O
customer B-AS
support I-AS
before O
I O
could O
even O
start O
the O
PC O
out O
of O
the O
box O
. O

Asus O
facial B-AS
recognition I-AS
does O
n't O
work O
and O
windows B-AS
logon I-AS
is O
n't O
either O
. O

Windows B-AS
Vista I-AS
makes O
this O
computer O
almost O
unusable O
for O
online B-AS
service I-AS
. O

I O
contacted O
Acer O
and O
they O
are O
giving O
me O
FREE O
recovery B-AS
DVDs I-AS
, O
so O
do O
n't O
go O
and O
pay O
for O
them O
, O
just O
ask O
for O
them O
and O
they O
should O
give O
them O
to O
you O
. O

Now O
when O
I O
order O
I O
did O
not O
go O
full O
scale O
for O
the O
webcam B-AS
or O
full O
keyboard B-AS
I O
wanted O
something O
for O
basics O
of O
being O
easy O
to O
carry B-AS
when O
I O
use O
crutchs O
or O
wheelchair O
and O
with O
a O
backpack O
laptop O
bag O
. O

Can O
listen O
to O
my O
music O
and O
watch O
my O
videos O
with O
ease O
and O
with O
a O
great O
display B-AS
. O

Otherwise O
, O
all O
other O
features B-AS
are O
a O
1 O

So O
in O
late O
March O
, O
early O
April O
2009 O
I O
was O
without O
it O
again O
for O
a O
couple O
weeks O
while O
I O
had O
online O
courses O
I O
had O
to O
complete O
and O
my O
fiance O
was O
in O
Afghanistan O
and O
web O
conferencing O
was O
the O
best O
communication O
method O
we O
had O
. O

The O
performance B-AS
is O
awesome O
. O

I O
pondered O
very O
long O
over O
this O
decision O
. O

This O
thing O
sucks O
! O

I O
Love O
my O
new O
computer O
! O

Okay O
, O
let O
's O
just O
start O
out O
by O
saying O
I O
am O
in O
no O
way O
a O
computer O
techy O
. O

It O
was O
a O
Waste O
of O
money O
from O
day O
one O
! O

I O
' O
m O
new O
, O
just O
switched O
from O
years O
of O
PC O
frustration O
. O

So O
I O
got O
another O
netbook O
which O
I O
love O
! O

But O
in O
fact O
it O
is O
totally O
the O
opposite O
. O

The O
display B-AS
is O
beyond O
horrible O
. O

He O
LEFT O
ME O
, O
instructions O
on O
what O
to O
do O
when O
this O
comes O
up O
, O
or O
that O
comes O
up O
. O

It O
's O
a O
joke O
. O

There O
is O
hardly O
any O
memory B-AS
on O
the O
computer O
's O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
. O

Actually O
, O
I O
had O
noticed O
the O
one O
on O
the O
sales O
floor O
also O
did O
n't O
have O
sound B-AS
! O

I O
started O
hainv O
problems O
with O
it O
within O
the O
first O
month O
. O

Next O
, O
most O
Acer O
laptop O
fans B-AS
are O
on O
the O
bottom O
which O
is O
right O
on O
your O
laptop O
. O

the O
laptop O
preformed B-AS
pretty O
well O
. O

I O
' O
m O
honestly O
afraid O
that O
it O
will O
burn O
me O
, O
it O
's O
that O
hot O
! O

But O
I O
do O
n't O
see O
it O
as O
a O
problem O
. O

Numerous O
problems O
over O
the O
next O
3 O
weeks O
until O
I O
got O
the O
blue O
screen O
of O
death O
and O
had O
to O
send O
the O
PC O
back O
to O
HP O
. O

I O
think O
this O
will O
happen O
to O
any O
new O
version O
of O
computer O
/ O
phone O
released O
and O
I O
need O
to O
wait O
for O
the O
next O
set O
of O
updates O
to O
have O
all O
of O
this O
fixed O
. O

This O
one O
has O
had O
the O
same O
effect O
. O

And O
if O
you O
are O
a O
game O
player O
it O
works O
with O
World O
Of O
Warcraft O
wonderfully O
. O

This O
computer O
is O
absolutely O
AMAZING O
! O
! O
! O

So O
buyer O
beware O
when O
buying O
Toshiba O

I O
found O
this O
laptop O
on O
sale O
for O
under O
6000 O
at O
Best O
Buy O
which O
was O
a O
great O
deal O
! O

I O
got O
my O
MacBook O
Pro O
because O
I O
wanted O
to O
do O
all O
the O
stuff O
I O
need O
to O
do O
without O
worrying O
about O
the O
system B-AS
quitting O
on O
me O
or O
freezing O
for O
a O
few O
minutes O
. O

I O
love O
the O
Apple O
products O
. O

I O
loved O
the O
netbook O
minus O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
was O
windows B-AS
OS I-AS
until O
this O
started O
happening O
. O

The O
minute O
you O
fire O
it O
up O
it O
's O
all O
good O
, O
very O
easy O
user B-AS
interface I-AS
. O

I O
have O
had O
two O
Toshiba O
satellite O
computers O
and O
while O
they O
are O
okay O
, O
they O
are O
in O
no O
way O
comparable O
to O
the O
Mac O
. O

I O
actually O
contact O
Toshiba O
before O
I O
started O
having O
problem O
and O
was O
given O
run O
around O
after O
I O
supplied O
serial O
number O
in O
order O
to O
delay O
me O
sending O
in O
laptop O
until O
after O
warrenty B-AS
expired O
. O

They O
're O
absolutely O
useless O
, O
unless O
you O
count O
the O
joy O
of O
releasing O
anger O
while O
smashing O
into O
little O
peices O
against O
the O
wall O
. O

was O
a O
great O
deal O
i O
will O
give O
that O
. O

There O
s O
also O
iDVD B-AS
, O
a O
program B-AS
dedicated O
to O
putting O
all O
your O
favorite O
media O
together O
photos O
, O
recordings O
, O
video O
projects O
into O
one O
program B-AS
so O
that O
you O
can O
create O
the O
perfect O
memoir O
for O
your O
parents O
, O
family O
, O
siblings O
, O
and O
any O
other O
person O
important O
in O
your O
life O
that O
there O
may O
be O
. O

His O
language O
was O
so O
bad O
I O
swore O
I O
was O
taking O
the O
turing O
test O
, O
and O
it O
was O
failing O
. O

After O
replacing O
the O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
the O
battery B-AS
stopped O
working O
3 O
months O
of O
use O
which O
was O
frustrating O
. O

Was O
this O
product O
worth O
my O
time O
and O
money O
to O
ever O
want O
to O
purchase O
another O
products O
that O
is O
toshiba O
or O
relating O
to O
toshiba O
? O
Probably O
not O
ever O
again O
. O

I O
have O
used O
PC O
's O
and O
converting O
to O
this O
MacBook O
Pro O
was O
easy O
. O

I O
love O
the O
easy O
to O
see O
screen B-AS
, O
and O
It O
works B-AS
well O
for O
work O
, O
persoal O
or O
just O
play O
. O

If O
what O
you O
need O
is O
a O
machine O
to O
do O
some O
surfing B-AS
, O
email O
checking O
, O
word B-AS
processing I-AS
, O
and O
watching O
a O
movie O
or O
two O
, O
this O
is O
the O
machine O
you O
want O
. O

-Apparently O
, O
contactus O
@ O
euroapplecom O
is O
not O
a O
good O
address O
to O
send O
complaints O
. O

It O
does O
n't O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
frills O
, O
but O
I O
did O
n't O
need O
any O
, O
and O
being O
able O
to O
buy O
what O
I O
needed O
, O
and O
not O
more O
than O
I O
needed O
was O
very O
important O
. O

the O
mouse B-AS
pad I-AS
and O
buttons B-AS
are O
the O
worst O
i O
' O
ve O
ever O
seen O
. O

I O
am O
sorry O
that O
I O
purchased O
this O
laptop O
. O

Awesome O
graphics B-AS
! O

It O
really O
is O
perfect O
for O
work B-AS
and O
play B-AS
. O

The O
pro O
is O
a O
great O
product O
, O
I O
wish O
that O
the O
13 O
inch O
models O
came O
with O
the O
Intel B-AS
i I-AS
processors I-AS
and O
had O
a O
more O
comfortable O
edge B-AS
the O
edge B-AS
hurt O
my O
wrists O
. O

I O
am O
a O
college O
student O
and O
it O
has O
been O
very O
useful O
. O

The O
apple O
MacBook O
is O
the O
best O
investment O
that O
I O
have O
ever O
made O
. O

My O
sister O
is O
the O
electronics O
manager O
at O
Wal O
Mart O
and O
she O
says O
that O
HP O
is O
the O
best O
. O

One O
drawback O
I O
noticed O
was O
sound B-AS
quality I-AS
via I-AS
USB I-AS
. O

The O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
sucked O
the O
juice O
from O
my O
laptop O
and O
when O
the O
extended O
life O
battery O
went O
out O
we O
were O
SOL O
there O
to O
, O
so O
much O
for O
that O
warranty B-AS
covering O
all O
the O
products O
we O
purchased O
. O

I O
needed O
a O
new O
computer O
for O
graduate O
school O
had O
never O
owned O
a O
laptop O
before O
, O
and O
the O
only O
reason O
I O
did O
n't O
purchase O
a O
Mac O
was O
because O
my O
school O
's O
website O
strongly O
recommended O
students O
purchase O
PCs O
. O

I O
have O
had O
another O
Mac O
, O
but O
it O
got O
slow O
due O
to O
an O
older O
operating B-AS
system I-AS
. O

If O
you O
have O
the O
money O
I O
suggest O
going O
for O
the O
i7 O
. O

That O
's O
very O
possible O
, O
but O
since O
they O
do O
n't O
make O
Windows B-AS
XP I-AS
drivers I-AS
for O
the O
sound B-AS
card I-AS
in O
this O
machine O
, O
I O
was O
stuck O
until O
Windows B-AS
7 I-AS
came O
out O
. O

I'ts O
nice O
to O
have O
the O
higher O
- O
end O
laptops O
, O
but O
this O
fits O
my O
budget B-AS
and O
the O
features B-AS
I O
need O
. O

It O
is O
, O
however O
, O
very O
heavy O
. O

Was O
disappointed O
to O
find O
out O
that O
the O
model O
had O
been O
discontinued O
, O
apparently O
because O
of O
known O
motherboard B-AS
problems O
. O

Well O
, O
I O
started O
using O
Google O
Chrome O
, O
which O
is O
a O
little O
better O
, O
but O
it O
freezes O
too O
sometimes O
. O

Also O
the O
speakers B-AS
are O
not O
very O
loud O
, O
But O
it O
is O
a O
netbook O
. O

LOVE O
THIS O
LAPTOP O
WONDERFUL O
PRICE B-AS
FOR O
WHAT O
YOU O
GET O
! O

But O
, O
at O
the O
same O
time O
they O
the O
company O
would O
not O
and O
could O
not O
do O
anything O
about O
my O
problem O
. O

Just O
a O
black O
screen B-AS
! O

All O
you O
have O
to O
do O
is O
turn O
it O
on O
and O
it O
works O
. O

A O
key O
contributor O
that O
led O
me O
to O
Mac O
is O
the O
art B-AS
aspect I-AS
. O

Eventually O
my O
battery B-AS
would O
n't O
charge O
, O
so O
unless O
I O
had O
it O
plugged O
in O
it O
would O
n't O
even O
power O
on O
. O

Recently O
there O
are O
a O
few O
incidents O
that O
annoy O
the O
hell O
out O
of O
me O
. O

Save O
your O
money O
and O
go O
for O
a O
better O
device O
. O

I O
have O
been O
a O
PC O
user O
since O
middle O
school O
, O
but O
in O
my O
mid O
twenties O
I O
decided O
to O
convert O
to O
the O
dark O
side O
, O
or O
should O
I O
say O
the O
brighter O
side O
of O
life O
. O

Purchased O
for O
development O
purposes O
, O
but O
it O
has O
turned O
into O
my O
everyday O
laptop O
as O
well O
for O
surfing B-AS
, O
e O
- O
mail O
, O
etc O
. O

without O
having O
to O
have O
extra O
equipment O
and/or O
complicated O
routes O
to O
take O
to O
be O
able O
to O
do O
so O
. O

My O
first O
problem O
was O
with O
the O
pre B-AS
- I-AS
loaded I-AS
Norton I-AS
Firewall I-AS
/ I-AS
Security I-AS
program I-AS
. O

I O
had O
a O
USB B-AS
connect I-AS
but O
, O
i O
ca O
n't O
use O
it O
because O
it O
is O
not O
compatible O
. O

Accordingly O
, O
I O
have O
decided O
to O
NEVER O
purchase O
another O
HP O
product O
my O
five O
year O
old O
Compaq O
lasted O
5-years O
before O
the O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
crashed O
. O

I O
ordered O
four O
D620 O
laptops O
. O

I O
know O
that O
everyone O
thinks O
Macs O
are O
overpriced O
and O
overrated O
, O
but O
once O
you O
get O
past O
the O
initial O
expense B-AS
you O
'll O
find O
that O
they O
're O
worth O
every O
penny O
besides O
, O
there O
's O
always O
the O
financing O
plan O
that O
Best O
Buy O
offers O
. O

I O
saw O
this O
one O
, O
and O
I O
have O
the O
most O
difficult O
time O
trying O
to O
use O
them O
, O
they O
' O
ve O
made O
great O
dust O
collectors O
, O
I O
hate O
putting O
this O
computer O
down O

I O
am O
not O
going O
to O
sit O
here O
and O
complain O
about O
it O
not O
having O
a O
cd O
drive O
and O
what O
not O
because O
it O
is O
a O
netbook O
, O
it O
is O
made O
to O
be O
compact O
and O
if O
you O
want O
all O
the O
other O
stuff O
get O
a O
laptop O
. O

I O
love O
the O
multi B-AS
- I-AS
touch I-AS
trackpad I-AS
. O

I O
was O
psyched O
. O

I O
absolutely O
love O
my O
mac O
! O

From O
the O
second O
you O
open O
the O
box O
you O
will O
fall O
in O
love O
with O
this O
computer O
! O

HP O
is O
more O
interested O
in O
selling O
extended B-AS
warranties I-AS
which O
cost B-AS
more O
than O
the O
netbook O
new O
then O
they O
are O
in O
helping O
or O
fixing O
. O

It O
would O
not O
let O
me O
connect O
to O
my O
Wifi O
system O
where O
I O
lived O
. O

Not O
too O
much O
junk O
software B-AS
to O
remove O
. O

System B-AS
is O
loosing O
about O
20 O
% O
of O
performance B-AS
because O
of O
that O
. O

It O
is O
easy O
to O
use B-AS
, O
good O
quality B-AS
and O
good O
price B-AS
. O

The O
difference O
in O
the O
Apple B-AS
keyboard I-AS
from O
a O
PC B-AS
's I-AS
keyboard I-AS
took O
a O
bit O
of O
tim O
to O
get O
used O
to O
, O
but O
overall O
it O
's O
worth O
it O
! O

It O
is O
also O
extremely O
pleasing O
to O
the O
eyes O
without O
looking O
too O
much O
like O
an O
Alienware O
gaming O
machine O
. O

The O
extended B-AS
warranty I-AS
for O
the O
$ O
4000 O
and O
up O
computers O
was O
the O
only O
one O
available O
for O
purchase O
on O
the O
drop O
drown O
menu O
. O

Only O
issue O
is O
that O
it O
is O
a O
little O
slow O
, O
and O
I O
' O
m O
fixing O
that O
by O
adding O
more O
RAM B-AS
. O

It O
is O
easily O
portable O
and O
I O
take O
it O
everywhere O
I O
go O
and O
might O
require O
internet O
access O
. O

If O
I O
have O
a O
few O
hundred O
dollars O
to O
spare O
, O
I O
'd O
buy O
the O
Pro O
line O
though O
, O
the O
253 O
and O
266 O
GHz O
model O
. O

The O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
crashed O
as O
well O
, O
and O
I O
had O
to O
buy O
a O
new O
power B-AS
cord I-AS
. O

But O
enough O
about O
that O
, O
I O
am O
an O
Apple O
convert O
for O
life O
. O

I O
love O
it O
and O
will O
probably O
get O
another O
one O
when O
this O
goes O
to O
the O
Laptop O
in O
the O
sky O
! O
! O

But O
, O
Mac O
makes O
the O
switch O
from O
PC O
to O
Mac O
easy O
. O

Another O
issue O
I O
have O
with O
it O
is O
the O
battery B-AS
. O

HELP O
, O
HELP O
, O
OTHER O
THAN O
THAT O
GETS O
A O
GREAT O
LITTLE O
WONDER O
. O

Now O
I O
know O
! O

After O
2 O
months O
of O
complaints O
, O
Asus O
finally O
sent O
the O
right O
power B-AS
supply I-AS
to O
my O
techies B-AS
. O

Even O
set O
at O
the O
highest O
level O
, O
the O
computer O
sacrifices O
its O
queen O
every O
time O
. O

That O
included O
the O
extra O
Sony B-AS
Sonic I-AS
Stage I-AS
software I-AS
, O
the O
speakers B-AS
and O
the O
subwoofer B-AS
I O
got O
that O
WAS O
worth O
the O
money O
, O
the O
bluetooth B-AS
mouse I-AS
for O
my O
supposedly O
bluetooth B-AS
enabled I-AS
computer O
, O
the O
extended B-AS
life I-AS
battery I-AS
and O
the O
Docking B-AS
port I-AS
. O

My O
MacBook O
Pro O
works B-AS
like O
a O
dream O
, O
it O
has O
never O
overheated O
, O
or O
even O
been O
slightly O
warm O
for O
that O
matter O
. O

PC O
users O
use O
the O
Powerpoint B-AS
program I-AS
for O
slide O
- O
show O
presentation O
and O
Mac O
users O
utilize O
Keynote B-AS
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
begin O
to O
say O
how O
disappointed O
I O
am O
. O

I O
get O
a O
ton O
of O
compliments O
on O
its O
size B-AS
, O
and O
speaking O
as O
someone O
who O
regularly O
commutes O
on O
a O
bus O
, O
I O
can O
attest O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
this O
is O
the O
perfect O
size B-AS
computer O
if O
you O
're O
restricted O
to O
the O
width O
of O
your O
body O
for O
computing O
room O
. O

It O
takes O
me O
approximately O
3 O
tries O
to O
get O
to O
each O
site O
, O
then O
after O
closing O
the O
browser B-AS
and O
reopening O
it O
it O
actually O
works O
. O

Easy O
to O
carry B-AS
, O
can O
be O
taken O
anywhere O
, O
can O
be O
hooked O
up O
to O
printers O
, O
headsets O
. O

also O
the O
keyboard B-AS
does O
not O
liht O
up O
so O
unless O
your O
sitting O
in O
a O
room O
with O
some O
light O
you O
ca O
n't O
see O
anything O
and O
that O
s O
bad O
for O
me O
because O
my O
boyfriend O
tends O
to O
watch O
tv O
in O
the O
dark O
at O
night O
which O
leaves O
me O
with O
no O
way O
of O
seeing O
the O
keyboard B-AS
. O

Take O
the O
simple O
, O
easy O
solution O
to O
your O
computer O
problems O
and O
stop O
waiting O
and O
smacking O
your O
old O
computer O
around O
. O

It O
is O
as O
good O
as O
new O
. O

And O
it O
did O
n't O
show O
up O
on O
the O
reciept O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
we O
ordered O
it O
online O
! O

I O
went O
from O
BestBuy O
to O
Dell O
, O
Windows O
to O
Apple O
. O

Back O
then O
my O
entire O
family O
was O
Devoted O
to O
the O
Sony O
name O
. O

When O
I O
got O
my O
laptop O
back O
after O
this O
first O
instance O
it O
worked O
okay O
for O
a O
little O
bit O
then O
I O
started O
expeirencing O
issues O
again O
, O
everything O
from O
programs B-AS
and O
drivers B-AS
failing O
again O
, O
to O
it O
powering O
off O
for O
no O
reason O
, O
to O
locking O
up O
and O
freezing O
and O
just O
all O
sorts O
of O
issues O
. O

Love O
that O
it O
does O
n't O
take O
up O
space B-AS
like O
a O
regular O
computer O
. O

weeks O

Amsterdam O
. O

They O
do O
n't O
seem O
to O
be O
susceptible O
to O
viruses O
, O
which O
is O
one O
less O
big O
thing O
to O
worry O
about O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
computers O
. O

I O
was O
very O
excited O
because O
this O
was O
my O
first O
personal O
computer O
and O
I O
was O
purchasing O
it O
with O
my O
OWN O
money O
I O
had O
recieved O
from O
graduation O
presents O
. O

Asked O
the O
customer B-AS
service I-AS
rep I-AS
. O

So O
, O
I O
took O
it O
back O
to O
the O
apple O
store O
and O
they O
narcissist O
genius B-AS
bar I-AS
staff I-AS
fixed O
it O
by O
resetting O
the O
fan B-AS
at O
boot B-AS
up I-AS
. O

I O
can O
not O
even O
imaging O
going O
back O
to O
a O
PC O
after O
using O
this O
wonderful O
computer O
. O

Basic O
computer O
. O

I O
fell O
in O
love O
with O
the O
hp O
pavillion O
and O
that O
was O
my O
replacement O
and O
now O
I O
could O
not O
imagine O
going O
back O
to O
an O
acer O
at O
all O
. O

It O
turns O
out O
that O
this O
hp O
pc O
had O
been O
preciously O
sold O
by O
Wal O
Mart O
. O

I O
would O
totally O
recommend O
any O
other O
laptop O
over O
this O
pile O
of O
grabage O
. O

I O
managed O
to O
comply O
with O
these O
too O
and O
now O
have O
to O
wait O
and O
see O
if O
they O
can O
find O
another O
way O
to O
screw O
me O
. O

I O
should O
have O
bought O
one O
a O
long O
time O
ago O
. O

I O
looked O
at O
the O
computer O
and O
it O
said O
updating O
but O
the O
asked O
for O
a O
product O
key O
. O

I O
got O
what O
I O
paid O
for O
. O

Just O
keep O
in O
mind O
the O
graphics O
is O
not O
dedicated O
so O
loading O
the O
movie O
almost O
took O
a O
minute O
, O
but O
it O
ran O
fairly O
smooth O
for O
a O
non O
- O
dedicated O
graphics O
card O
. O

In O
the O
way O
of O
operating O
a O
mouse B-AS
in O
small O
area O
. O

However O
I O
dealt O
with O
this O
problem O
for O
over O
a O
year O
and O
it O
was O
more O
of O
a O
hastle O
then O
I O
have O
EVER O
had O
with O
anything O
. O

I O
got O
the O
first O

I O
agree O
with O
the O
previous O
comment O
that O
ASUS B-AS
TECH I-AS
SUPPORT I-AS
IS O
HORRIBLE O
WHICH O
IS O
A O
CON O
IN O
MY O
OPINION O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
somehow O
and O
I O
never O
opened O
it O
up O
some O
specks O
of O
dust O
or O
something O
got O
inside O
the O
screen B-AS
and O
are O
now O
there O
permanently O
, O
behind O
the O
front O
of O
the O
screen B-AS
, O
in O
the O
way O
of O
the O
display B-AS
. O

It O
seems O
to O
be O
incompatible O
with O
everything O
else O
. O

the O
mouse B-AS
on I-AS
the I-AS
pad I-AS
, O
the O
left B-AS
button I-AS
always O
sticks O
. O

When O
I O
took O
it O
back O
to O
Best O
Buy O
I O
asked O
them O
if O
they O
were O
seriously O
trying O
to O
drive O
me O
insane O
! O

i O
have O
tried O
to O
charge O
on O
different O
batteries B-AS
with O
no O
luck O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
this O
computer O
to O
anyone O
searching O
for O
the O
perfect O
laptop O
, O
and O
the O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
is O
amazing O
. O

We O
use O
the O
built B-AS
in I-AS
tools I-AS
often O
, O
iTunes B-AS
is O
open O
nearly O
every O
day O
and O
works O
great O
with O
my O
iPhone O
. O

But O
my O
blog O
is O
read O
by O
my O
friends O
and O
search O
engine O
visitors O
. O

It O
was O
returned O
on O
the O
third O
day O
I O
owned O
it O
. O

IT O
WANT O
TAKE O
IT O
, O
IT O
KEEP O
SAYING O
ERROR O
. O

Anyone O
who O
is O
considering O
buying O
an O
Acer O
computer O
of O
any O
sort O
, O
I O
seriously O
suggest O
you O
look O
into O
buying O
a O
different O
brand O
. O

the O
size B-AS
of O
has O
actually O
help O
me O
out O
quite O
a O
bit O
by O
me O
being O
able O
to O
fit O
it O
in O
an O
already O
full O
backpack O
and O
to O
use O
it O
at O
a O
resturant O
where O
the O
food O
on O
the O
table O
is O
always O
so O
space O
consuming O
. O

Highly O
recommend O
for O
daily O
use O
. O

We O
are O
addicted O
to O
the O
Mac O
. O

Because O
it O
IS O
a O
defective O
product O
. O

Second O
, O
it O
gets O
scratches O
easily O
and O
when O
it O
gets O
old O
some O
thing O
may O
operated O

True O
quality B-AS
at O
a O
great O
price B-AS
! O

Not O
easy O
to O
carry B-AS
. O

The O
programs B-AS
that O
come O
standard O
with O
the O
Leopard B-AS
running I-AS
system I-AS
are O
enough O
for O
the O
average O
person O
to O
run O
all O
the O
basics O
. O

I O
am O
really O
heartbroken O
to O
have O
to O
post O
a O
terrible O
review O
. O

So O
what O
am O
I O
supposed O
to O
do O
? O
The O
LG B-AS
service I-AS
center I-AS
can O
not O
provide O
me O
the O
service B-AS
when O
it O
is O
called O
the O
service B-AS
center I-AS
. O

The O
Material B-AS
this O
Pro O
is O
made O
out O
of O
seems O
a O
lot O
nicer O
than O
any O
PC O
Specs B-AS
, O
Like O
I O
said O
this O
performs B-AS
a O
lot O
better O
than O
any O
computer O
I O
' O
ve O
had O
in O
the O
past O
. O

It O
has O
been O
nothing O
but O
trouble O
from O
the O
time O
we O
bought O
it O
. O

After O
doing O
extensive O
research O
, O
macconnection O
had O
the O
lowest O
price B-AS
on O
the O
15 O
MBP O
i5 O
. O

I O
am O
ADDICTED O
to O
photo B-AS
booth I-AS
! O

The O
operating B-AS
system I-AS
and O
user B-AS
interface I-AS
is O
very O
intuitive O
, O
and O
the O
large O
multi B-AS
- I-AS
touch I-AS
track I-AS
pad I-AS
is O
amazing O
. O

So O
, O
I O
went O
back O
. O

I O
like O
it O
so O
much O
, O
I O
bought O
another O
just O
for O
my O
wife O
. O

I O
took O
it O
back O
to O
the O
store O
and O
exchanged O
it O
for O
another O
one O
. O

All O
in O
all O
great O
item O
highly O
recommend O
it O
. O

Hard B-AS
disk I-AS
, O
The O
new O
editions O
gives O
you O
more O
hard B-AS
disk I-AS
space I-AS
500 O
GB O
instead O
of O
320 O
GB O
but O
time O
has O
taught O
me O
never O
to O
trust O
an O
internal B-AS
hard I-AS
disk I-AS
. O

This O
laptop O
rocks O
only O
wish O
it O
could O
run O
SolidWorks O
CAD O
, O
which O
Apple O
does O
n't O
support O
! O

It O
is O
extremely O
portable O
and O
easily O
connects B-AS
to I-AS
WIFI I-AS
at O
the O
library O
and O
elsewhere O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
have O
that O
additional O
money O
right O
now O
, O
and O
therefore O
would O
n't O
have O
purchased O
it O
at O
this O
time O
. O

First O
things O
first O
, O
Macbook O
pro O
has O
many O
applications B-AS
to O
make O
life O
easier O
, O
unlike O
the O
windows B-AS
computers O
. O

And O
the O
screen B-AS
on O
this O
thing O
is O
absolutely O
amazing O
for O
high O
quality O
videos O
and O
movies O
and O
gaming B-AS
. O

Fast O
, O
fast O
and O
fast O
, O
the O
web O
pages O
just O
fly O
by O
. O

I O
considered O
I O
may O
have O
too O
much O
on O
the O
computer O
, O
but O
after O
looking O
, O
there O
was O
plenty O
of O
space B-AS
and O
that O
is O
not O
the O
issue O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
use O
my O
laptop O
in O
a O
way O
though O
that O
needs O
a O
long O
battery O
life O
so O
it O
's O
perfect O
for O
me O
. O

Guess O
I O
'll O
stay O
away O
from O
HP O
. O

It O
is O
made O
better O
, O
thicker O
, O
and O
all O
out O
tough O
! O

It O
was O
about O
six O
months O
later O
when O
the O
overheating O
problem O
started O
again O
, O
to O
the O
point O
it O
felt O
like O
fire O
on O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
machine O
! O

There O
is O
a O
blank O
lighted O
screen O
when O
I O
start O
and O
that O
is O
all O
. O

And O
i O
would O
recommend O
this O
to O
anypne O
looking O
for O
a O
new O
laptop O
. O

But O
then O
, O
something O
goes O
wrong O
. O

So O
far O
so O
good O
with O
this O
laptop O
. O

i O
must O
keep O
it O
plugged O
in O
at O
all O
times O
because O
it O
will O
not O
keep O
a O
charge B-AS
for O
longer O
than O
four O
minutes O
. O

Avoid O
this O
model O
. O

Summary O
, O
I O
' O
ve O
had O
this O
laptop O
for O
2 O
months O
, O
out O
of O
the O
blue O
the O
power B-AS
adapter I-AS
stops O
working O
. O

I O
saw O
walmart O
had O
the O
same O
computer O
for O
about O
$ O
650 O
but O
still O
knowing O
what O
I O
know O
now O
, O
I O
would O
not O
buy O
it O
at O
that O
price B-AS
. O

The O
local O
computer O
repair O
shops O
send O
out O
ads O
that O
say O
along O
the O
lines O
of O
we O
can O
fix O
almost O
any O
problem O
or O
computer O
usually O
even O
the O
trouble O
some O
Toshiba O
satellite O
. O

it O
has O
had O
some O
problems O
. O

There O
s O
always O
something O
wrong O
with O
it O
, O
wether O
it O
be O
some O
virus O
you O
ca O
n't O
track O
down O
, O
or O
it O
overheats O
, O
sometimes O
even O
catches O
on O
fire O
, O
you O
just O
ca O
n't O
use O
it O
. O

This O
computer O
is O
good O
for O
10 O
days O
then O
it O
sucks O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
your O
life O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
for O
a O
student O
, O
weight B-AS
is O
always O
an O
issue O
. O

Now O
mainboard B-AS
is O
broken O
, O
have O
to O
wait O
for O
a O
new O
one O
. O

The O
speed B-AS
difference O
is O
next O
to O
NOTHING O
for O
a O
mac O
, O
and O
the O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
can O
be O
manually O
upgraded O
or O
you O
could O
just O
buy O
a O
$ O
60 O
500 O
gb O
external O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
. O

2The O
wireless B-AS
card I-AS
is O
low O
quality O
. O

This O
little O
netboook O
is O
helping O
me O
get O
work O
done O
! O

They O
also O
use O
two O
totally O
different O
operating B-AS
systems I-AS
. O

They O
are O
about O
the O
same O
size O
keys B-AS
. O

I O
' O
m O
definitely O
not O
hard O
on O
laptops O
and O
guarantee O
100 O
% O
that O
no O
liquid O
has O
touched O
this O
machine O
in O
my O
presence O
. O

I O
waited O
another O
month O
for O
approval O
and O
for O
them O
to O
BUILD O
me O
a O
new O
laptop O
. O

This O
ai O
n't O
it O
. O

I O
was O
n't O
really O
as O
concerned O
about O
portability O
it O
's O
a O
very O
large O
laptop O
but O
it O
's O
not O
hard O
to O
move O
around O
or O
take O
on O
a O
trip O
which O
was O
a O
pleasant O
surprise O
. O

The O
people O
are O
frustrating O
to O
work O
with O
, O
the O
product O
itself O
is O
very O
cheaply O
made O
, O
and O
the O
accessories B-AS
are O
less O
than O
satisfactory O
. O

They O
offer O
the O
best O
warranty B-AS
in O
the O
business O
, O
and O
do O
n't O
3rd O
party O
it O
out O
like O
Toshiba O
. O

Maybe O
three O
or O
four O
months O
ago O
it O
started O
blinking O
all O
of O
the O
sudden O
. O

The O
only O
problems O
are O
the O
sound B-AS
is O
nt O
very O
loud O
I O
have O
to O
wear O
headphones O
. O

Again O
windows B-AS
based O
machines O
were O
not O
giving O
me O
anything O
to O
work O
with O
! O

Finally O
, O
I O
could O
n't O
take O
it O
anymore O
and O
ordered O
my O
Apple O
. O

I O
should O
have O
kept O
my O
big O
, O
old O
HP O
. O

everything O
about O
a O
mac O
is O
wonderful O
, O
it O
takes O
a O
little O
used O
to O
learning O
and O
getting O
used O
to O
the O
new O
system B-AS
, O
but O
you O
will O
learn O
fast O
and O
its O
all O
worth O
it O
. O

i O
love O
the O
size B-AS
of O
the O
computer O
since O
i O
play O
games B-AS
on O
it O
. O

I O
am O
a O
wife O
, O
mom O
and O
a O
school O
teacher O
and O
a O
college O
student O
. O

You O
know O
, O
using O
the O
computer O
should O
be O
fun O
, O
not O
aggrevation O
, O
especially O
when O
you O
are O
playing B-AS
games I-AS
or O
working O
with O
photos O
. O

You O
just O
get O
a O
trial O
version O
either O
way O
. O

I O
' O
m O
all O
for O
saving O
money O
but O
Dell O
needs O
to O
step O
it O
up O
. O

There O
are O
no O
viruses O
or O
spyware O
to O
worry O
about O
like O
on O
a O
Windows B-AS
computer O
. O

great O
machine O
if O
you O
want O
to O
drop O
the O
cash O
for O
one O
. O

To O
be O
honest O
i O
think O
it O
was O
faulty O
equipment B-AS
or O
something O
but O
idk O
. O

I O
also O
love O
the O
small O
, O
convenient O
size B-AS
of O
my O
laptop O
, O
making O
it O
a O
perfect O
tool O
for O
my O
academic O
studies O
. O

I O
never O
have O
had O
a O
good O
result O
with O
this O
computer O
. O

I O
love O
its O
solid O
build B-AS
, O
light O
wt B-AS
and O
excellent O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
for O
now O
. O

YOU O
PAY O
FOR O
WHAT O
YOU O
GET O
FOR O
. O

while O
about O
8 O
years O
ago O
, O
I O
hope O
that O
the O
quality B-AS
has O
changed O
. O

NO O
more O
Lenovo O
for O
me O
. O

I O
also O
bought O
one O
for O
my O
wife O
, O
and O
3 O
for O
my O
office O
. O

However O
, O
a O
NETBOOK O
will O
be O
a O
different O
story O
. O

I O
' O
m O
glad O
I O
bought O
this O
laptop O
, O
it O
was O
worth O
the O
few O
$ O
100 O
extra O
dollars O
. O

The O
difference O
is O
it O
's O
a O
whole O
lot O
of O
fun O
using O
the O
laptop O
now O
, O
still O
learning O
the O
Apple B-AS
navigation I-AS
, O
but O
is O
fun O
and O
comes O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
cool O
apps B-AS
. O

I O
am O
a O
full O
Mac O
convert O
now O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
that O
you O
buy O
this O
product O
. O

Though O
you O
get O
a O
polite O
person O
, O
you O
often O
don O
t O
get O
a O
solution O
. O

-I O
propose O
that O
I O
can O
just O
swap O
the O
hard B-AS
drives I-AS
. O

It O
was O
old O
but O
it O
was O
not O
till O
we O
bought O
the O
Dell O
did O
we O
realize O
how O
great O
it O
was O
. O

The O
battery B-AS
holds O
up O
well O
, O
it O
's O
built B-AS
very O
solidly O
, O
and O
runs B-AS
fast O
. O

Sound B-AS
card I-AS
is O
limited O
though O
. O

I O
initially O
purchased O
my O
Macbook O
Pro O
13 O
in O
April O
, O
and O
I O
loved O
it O
. O

This O
is O
a O
nicely O
sized B-AS
laptop O
with O
lots O
of O
processing B-AS
power I-AS
and O
long O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
. O

After O
much O
battling O
with O
HP O
i O
was O
able O
to O
return O
it O
4 O
times O
for O
repairs O
. O

So O
, O
you O
can O
imagine O
how O
unhappy O
I O
am O
with O
this O
item O
. O

But O
let O
me O
tell O
you O
, O
the O
mac O
book O
pro O
is O
so O
professional O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
can O
imagine O
is O
that O
Sony O
jumped O
on O
early O
specifications O
for O
Vista B-AS
requirements O
from O
Microsoft O
and O
designed O
it O
to O
those O
inadequate O
requirements O
. O

go O
for O
it O
! O

I O
highly O
recommend O
this O
computer O
for O
students O
looking O
for O
a O
solid O
machine O
to O
get O
them O
through O
college O
. O

The O
keyboard O
, O
which O
generally O
felt O
okay O
even O
for O
someone O
used O
to O
a O
desktop B-AS
keyboard I-AS
, O
now O
looks O
terrible O
. O

The O
display B-AS
is O
awesome O
. O

After O
years O
of O
occasionally O
pulling O
my O
hair O
out O
fighting O
computer O
viruses O
, O
a O
good O
friend O
convinced O
me O
it O
was O
time O
to O
go O
the O
Apple O
route O
. O

The O
mouse O
is O
a O
little O
bit O
different O
than O
what O
you O
're O
used O
to O
though O
it O
has O
one O
big O
flat O
panel O
and O
one O
full O
bar O
instead O
of O
two O
separate O
ones O
to O
click O
with O
but O
you O
get O
used O
to O
it O
quite O
quickly O
. O

It O
took O
several O
weeks O
just O
to O
get O
them O
to O
acknowledge O
that O
I O
owned O
the O
warranty B-AS
. O

However O
, O
this O
laptop O
has O
a O
fatal O
flaw O
that O
i O
discovered O
merely O
a O
week O
after O
buying O
it O
. O

Perfect O
trifecta O
! O

The O
keyboard B-AS
is O
like O
no O
other O
laptop O
keyboard B-AS
. O

It O
was O
a O
huge O
monstrosity O
of O
a O
Laptop O
! O

-Computer O
crashed O
frequently O
and O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
decreased O
very O
quickly O
. O

-I O
propose O
that O
they O
can O
just O
swap O
the O
hard B-AS
drives I-AS
. O

So O
do O
n't O
get O
it O
. O

it O
was O
a O
tough O
choice O
. O

Every O
driver B-AS
on O
the O
driver B-AS
DVD O
is O
everything O
you O
will O
need O
for O
a O
reload O
. O

They O
sent O
it O
off O
and O
within O
2 O
weeks O
I O
had O
it O
back O
good O
as O
new O
. O

The O
Awesomest O
of O
the O
awesomest O
. O

One O
, O
owning O
a O
mac O
is O
essentially O
a O
full O
production O
studio O
in O
the O
case O
of O
a O
mac O
book O
a O
portable O
version O
. O

I O
would O
like O
to O
tell O
you O
about O
the O
best O
laptop O
I O
just O
got O
from O
Mac O
. O

I O
' O
m O
glad O
it O
waited O
, O
this O
one O
is O
great O
. O

I O
called O
their O
repair B-AS
depot I-AS
as O
was O
told O
they O
would O
send O
Me O
a O
new O
box O
to O
return O
the O
computer O
to O
the O
repair B-AS
depot I-AS
. O

For O
those O
old O
enough O
to O
remember O
, O
it O
is O
similar O
to O
Beta O
versus O
VHS O
. O

It O
's O
also O
fairly O
easy O
to O
use O
the O
Operating B-AS
System I-AS
. O

But O
, O
I O
would O
recommend O
this O
product O
. O

I O
know O
that O
ASUS O
is O
known O
for O
making O
motherboards O
, O
but O
this O
is O
the O
worst O
computer O
experience O
that O
I O
have O
ever O
had O
. O

If O
so O
, O
you O
may O
be O
having O
similar O
problems O
. O

Some O
days O
it O
's O
just O
blurry O
, O
some O
days O
it O
appears O
that O
it O
's O
raining O
on O
my O
nice O
desktop O
background O
of O
a O
lake O
and O
mountains O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
machine O
! O

This O
is O
my O
first O
personal O
Satellite O
purchase O
but O
had O
very O
good O
experience O
through O
previous O
Satellite O
work O
issued O
laptops O
. O

We O
figure O
that O
after O
everything O
HIS O
pc O
actually O
ended O
up O
costing B-AS
$ O
350 O
more O
than O
my O
original O
Mac O
. O

So O
having O
the O
AC B-AS
plug I-AS
go O
out O
on O
me O
and O
get O
lose O
or O
I O
could O
actually O
here O
it O
inside O
my O
computer O
on O
two O
of O
the O
three O
times O
is O
not O
good O
. O

Peformance B-AS
is O
good O
for O
the O
price B-AS
. O

The O
computer O
is O
currently O
in O
West O
Verginia O
doe O
to O
the O
method O
of O
shipping B-AS
choosen O
by O
Toshiba O
. O

I O
can O
see O
why O
the O
have O
soooo O
much O
money O
. O

I O
' O
M O
REALLY O
FRUSTRATED O
BY O
THIS O
EXPERIENCE O
. O

And O
Toshiba O
is O
totally O
unconcerned O
. O

Summary O
, O
HP O
knew O
they O
were O
shipping O
out O
bad O
BIOS B-AS
and O
did O
nothing O
proactive O
to O
resolve O
it O
. O

And O
in O
6 O
months O
, O
there O
have O
been O
no O
freezing O
up O
and O
no O
blue O
, O
purple O
, O
black O
or O
any O
other O
type O
of O
screen O
. O

I O
had O
3 O
months O
when O
the O
ports B-AS
started O
going O
out O
. O

think O
i O
would O
spend O
little O
extra O
to O
get O
a O
better O
made O
laptop O
. O

The O
improvements O
to O
the O
OS B-AS
have O
been O
relatively O
gradual O
, O
but O
substantive O
. O

I O
'll O
wait O
and O
save O
up O
for O
a O
new O
one O
. O

This O
laptop O
does O
everything O
I O
need O
it O
to O
very O
well O
. O

They O
are O
not O
. O

It O
makes O
sorting O
out O
all O
those O
photos O
on O
my O
digital O
camera O
a O
breeze O
, O
and O
organizing O
them O
by O
place O
, O
time O
taken O
, O
or O
sending O
them O
to O
an O
online O
print O
shop O
, O
or O
uploading O
them O
to O
Flickr O
or O
Facebook O
etc O
, O
is O
not O
hard O
at O
all O
. O

Its O
been O
a O
year O
and O
am O
still O
waiting O
to O
see O
what O
there O
going O
to O
do O
about O
my O
laptop O
. O

I O
bought O
it O
to O
use O
in O
college O
and O
it O
is O
perfect O
. O

It O
is O
super O
easy O
to O
use B-AS
. O

Many O
of O
my O
classmates O
computers O
hard B-AS
drives I-AS
crashed O
. O

Ease O
of O
use B-AS
is O
just O
one O
of O
the O
benefits O
I O
love O
about O
my O
Mac O
. O

I O
would O
n't O
play O
a O
first O
- O
person O
shooter O
with O
this O
, O
mind O

but O
if O
you O
wanted O
to O
run O
MS B-AS

a O

listen O
to O

and O
were O
looking O
for O
a O
highly O
portable O
yet O
powerful O
netbook O
to O
do O
that O
all O
in O
, O
I O
'd O
highly O
recommend O
checking O
this O
out O
. O

The O
13 O
Macbook O
Pro O
just O
fits O
in O
my O
budget B-AS
and O
with O
free O
shipping B-AS
and O
no O
tax O
to O
CA O
this O
is O
the O
best O
price B-AS
we O
can O
get O
for O
a O
great O
product O
. O

It O
took O
me O
a O
while O
top O

away O
from O

but O
now O
that O
I O

They O
discovered O
the O
manufacturer O
's O
defect O
and O
sent O
it O
in O
for O
repair O

The O
sheer O

for O

they O
will O
not O
let O
you O
down O

what O

HP O
Pavilion O
-- O
If O
I O
recall O
correctly O

it O
was O

It O
's O
not O
a O
recommendation O
, O
it O
a O
plea O

In O
early O
May O
I O
got O
it O
back O
and O
this O
time O
I O
only O
had O
it O
back O
for O
1 O
day O
before O
it O
had O
a O
NEW O
issue O
so O
it O
was O
sent O
back O
in O

expedited O
the O
repairs O
so O
I O
was O
only O
supposed O
to O
have O
to O
be O
without O
it O
for O
3 O
days O
and O
it O
was O
supposed O
to O
be O
fixed O
, O
by O
a O
Senior B-AS
Tech I-AS
. O

Some O
features B-AS
are O
nt O
friendly O
volume B-AS
wheel I-AS
, O
sound B-AS
quality I-AS
, O
etc O
. O

A O
cheaper O
price B-AS
should O
not O
equal O
a O
cheap O
product O
. O

-When O
I O
started O
worrying O
for O
not O
hearing O
anything O
from O
them O
, O
I O
tried O
to O
call O
. O

I O
think O
the O
manual B-AS
is O
somewhere O
on O
the O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
, O
but O
I O
rather O
have O
a O
hard O
copy O
. O

got O
another O
1 O
, O
and O
same O
issue O
. O

Thank O
you O
Best O
Buy O
for O
putting O
my O
computer O
together O
and O
installing O
my O
first O
software B-AS
, O
you O
guys O
were O
GREAT O
too O
! O

They O
were O
able O
to O
set O
- O
up O
with O
labtops O
themselves O
within O
a O
few O
minutes O
. O

I O
consider O
myself O
an O
average O
user O
and O
this O
computer O
serves O
my O
need O
. O

Adjust O
the O
sensitivity B-AS
since O
it O
's O
not O
that O
responsive O
to O
begin O
with O
. O

After O
a O
couple O
of O
years O
, O
my O
battery B-AS
life O
began O
to O
diminish O
but O
was O
replaced O
for O
free O
due O
to O
a O
company O
- O
wide O
recall O
of O
my O
particular O
battery B-AS
. O

The O
system B-AS
constantly O
overheats O
, O
the O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
is O
too O
short O
, O
the O
case B-AS
is O
coming O
apart O
, O
and O
my O
core B-AS
applications I-AS
that O
I O
use O
every O
day O
in O
my O
work O
as O
a O
graphic O
artist O
run O
poorly O
. O

I O
would O
never O
buy O
a O
Dell O
again O
. O

Later O
it O
held O
zero O
charge B-AS
and O
its O
replacement O
worked O
for O
less O
than O
three O
months O
. O

The O
company O
sent O
me O
a O
whole O
new O
cord B-AS
overnight O
and O
apologized O
. O

It O
's O
even O
easy O
to O
hook B-AS
up I-AS
to I-AS
other I-AS
wireless I-AS
networks I-AS
. O

Also O
, O
I O
have O
had O
alot O
of O
trouble O
with O
the O
shift B-AS
key I-AS
to O
go O
to O
other O
lines O
. O

The O
rep B-AS
did O
not O
even O
answer O
my O
question O
, O
I O
had O
to O
ask O
him O
, O
if O
he O
understood O
what O
I O
ask O
or O
if O
he O
spoke O
english O
because O
he O
did O
n't O
even O
try O
to O
acknowledge O
my O
question O
. O

I O
am O
now O
frustrated O
that O
I O
still O
have O
to O
use O
my O
work O
issued O
Windows O
laptop O
! O

It O
gives O
me O
the O
power B-AS
and O
speed B-AS
that O
I O
need O
to O
run O
all O
the O
programs B-AS
I O
use O
to O
edit O
. O

iLife B-AS
is O
easily O
compatible O
with O
Microsoft B-AS
Office I-AS
so O
you O
can O
send O
and O
receive O
files O
from O
a O
PC O
. O

They O
do O
n't O
crash O
. O

As O
a O
computer O
science O
student O
in O
college O
, O
I O
find O
that O
the O
portability B-AS
, O
longevity B-AS
, O
and O
ease O
of O
use B-AS
of O
this O
computer O
make O
me O
shockingly O
want O
to O
do O
homework O
more O
; O

This O
Notebook O
restarts O
every O
time O
there O
is O
a O
new O
update O
, O
so O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
save O
your O
files O
and O
information O
, O
everything O
will O
be O
lost O
. O

I O
love O
this O
little O
one O
. O

So O
not O
having O
my O
laptop O
was O
discouraging O
. O

I O
fine O
Apple O
MC373LL O
/ O
A O
266GHz O
15 O
Macboook O
Pro O
Notebook O
meets O
all O
my O
needs O
for O
a O
laptop O
computer O
when O
on O
the O
go O
. O

Again O
I O
sent O
it O
back O
and O
they O
replaced O
the O
motherboard B-AS
and O
some O
fan B-AS
inside O
. O

Fully O
charged B-AS
, O
the O
MacBook O
Pro O
can O
last O
about O
five O
hours O
unplugged O
. O

It O
was O
a O
hard O
decision O
for O
me O
since O
the O
MacBook O
Pro O
looked O
so O
appealing O
. O

1st O
hand O
experience O
is O
very O
important O
, O
especially O
for O
a O
new O
customer O
. O

I O
especially O
appreciate O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
has O
almost O
zero O
viruses O
and O
spyware O
problems O
! O

Even O
though O
it O
is O
much O
more O
expensive O
than O
many O
PC O
laptops O
, O
it O
is O
worth O
the O
price O
. O

I O
know O
there O
are O
way O
better O
laptops O
out O
there O
for O
the O
same O
price B-AS
, O
and O
why O
spend O
money O
on O
shit O
when O
you O
can O
go O
out O
and O
get O
yourself O
a O
perfectly O
decent O
laptop O
that O
does O
nt O
suck O
total O
monkey O
balls O
. O

For O
me O
, O
keys B-AS
were O
starting O
to O
get O
stuck O
and O
would O
n't O
type O
very O
well O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
like O
this O
company O
nor O
the O
toshiba O
brand O
, O
and O
I O
'll O
never O
buy O
another O
one O
because O
I O
' O
ve O
put O
more O
into O
it O
then O
it O
is O
worth O
. O

ca O
n't O
reinstall O
with O
standard B-AS
os I-AS
cd I-AS
because O
of O
proprietary B-AS
hardware I-AS
drivers I-AS
. O

However O
, O
this O
will O
be O
my O
last O
as O
well O
. O

There O
is O
a O
small O
red O
circle O
next O
to O
it O
with O
a O
x O
in O
the O
middle O
, O
and O
when O
I O
click O
on O
it O
it O
says O
, O
Consider O
replacing O
your O
battery B-AS
and O
it O
does O
not O
hold O
full O
charge B-AS
. O

SO O
? O
HOW O
CAN O
YOU O
SOLVE O
IT O
? O
C'm O
on O
, O
I O
just O
bought O
the O
netbook O
2 O
weeks O
ago O
. O

The O
computer O
was O
two O
weeks O
late O
in O
delivery B-AS
because O
HP O
forgot O
to O
complete O
the O
required O
import O
paperwork O
. O

If O
you O
're O
looking O
for O
a O
great O
laptop O
, O
you O
' O
ve O
found O
the O
best O
here O
. O

The O
first O
programm B-AS
I O
switched O
on O
was O
a O
game O
for O
my O
children O
. O

I O
have O
been O
very O
pleased O
with O
the O
performance B-AS
of O
this O
laptop O
. O

I O
have O
had O
my O
MacBook O
for O
almost O
6 O
months O
and O
can O
honestly O
say O
that O
I O
will O
NEVER O
buy O
another O
computer O
if O
it O
is O
not O
a O
Mac O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
always O
owned O
a O
PC O
and O
decided O
to O
try O
a O
MacBook O
to O
see O
what O
it O
's O
all O
about O
. O

On O
two O
occasions O
the O
computer O
s O
calendar O
told O
me O
it O
was O
1969 O
. O

I O
bought O
it O
for O
my O
mom O
and O
she O
reports O
that O
the O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
lasts O
all O
day O
for O
her O
, O
it O
's O
very O
lightweight O
, O
and O
the O
response B-AS
for O
the O
computing O
she O
's O
doing O
Internet B-AS
focused I-AS
activity I-AS
, O
mail O
, O
research O
, O
etc O
is O
excellent O
; O
. O

Its O
very O
nice O
and O
once O
you O
learn O
the O
features B-AS
you O
will O
be O
so O
happy O
to O
have O
such O
a O
sophisticated O
computer O
. O

Overall O
, O
this O
is O
a O
wonderful O
computer O
and O
definitly O
worth O
the O
purchase O
! O

It O
came O
alot O
faster O
than O
I O
thought O
it O
would O
have O
which O
was O
really O
exciting O
. O

Then O
to O
make O
matters O
worst O
, O
there O
is O
noone O
that O
they O
can O
transfer O
you O
to O
. O

It O
is O
sleek O
and O
lightweight O
and O
charges B-AS
quickly O
when O
needed O
. O

also O
you O
may O
need O
to O
charge B-AS
it O
once O
a O
day O
, O
if O
for O
medium O
use O
every O
thing O
fast O
and O
easy O
with O
mac O
the O
size B-AS
and O
look B-AS
is O
the O
most O
feature B-AS
that O
attracted O
me O
to O
it O
. O

But O
if O
you O
are O
in O
the O
computer O
field O
you O
probably O
would O
n't O
be O
here O
. O

The O
great O
18 O
month O
same O
as O
cash O
financing O
and O
Advance O
Protection O
Plan O
which O
includes O
accidents O
like O
spills O
. O

I O
could O
not O
handle O
it O
one O
hand O
like O
I O
can O
the O
replacement O
computer O
I O
purchased O
. O

The O
new O
Macbook O
Pro O
15 O
inch O
i7 O
is O
nothing O
short O
of O
amazing O
. O

i O
would O
never O
go O
back O
any O
more O
, O
i O
love O
this O
computer O
so O
much O
and O
i O
would O
recommend O
it O
to O
everyone O
. O

they O
respond O
, O
your O
dissatisfaction O
is O
noted O
. O

I O
was O
even O
able O
to O
uninstall O
McAffe O
and O
install O
one O
of O
my O
Symantec O
licenses O
with O
a O
no O
issues O
whatsoever O
. O

The O
iBook B-AS
backup I-AS
also O
uses O
a O
firewire B-AS
connection I-AS
. O

I O
did O
think O
it O
had O
a O
camera B-AS
because O
that O
was O
one O
of O
my O
requirements O
, O
but O
forgot O
to O
check O
in O
the O
specifications B-AS
on O
this O
one O
before O
I O
purchased O
. O

Also O
the O
display B-AS
is O
exceptional O
! O

This O
is O
still O
a O
fairly O
good O
upgrade O
to O
a O
laptop O
that O
was O
about O
4 O
years O
old O
. O

The O
computer O
was O
shipped O
to O
their O
repair B-AS
depot I-AS
on O
june O
24 O
and O
returned O
on O
July O
2 O
seems O
like O
a O
short O
turn O
around O
time O
except O
the O
computer O
was O
not O
repaired O
when O
it O
was O
returned O
. O

This O
is O
basically O
the O
best O
laptop O
I O
have O
ever O
had O
or O
used O
. O

3DMARK6 O
score O
is O
only O
8500 O
. O

I O
tell O
everyone O
I O
see O
out O
looking O
to O
get O
this O
or O
another O
Toshiba O
. O

So O
honestly O
, O
I O
was O
n't O
expecting O
anything O
less O
than O
perfection O
, O
and O
I O
was O
n't O
disappointed O
. O

Learning O
all O
of O
the O
keyboard B-AS
shortcuts I-AS
only O
took O
a O
few O
minutes O
to O
get O
used O
to O
as O
some O
of O
the O
shortcuts B-AS
are O
the O
same O
on O
Windows O
machines O
. O

My O
friends O
are O
in O
awe O
every O
time O
they O
come O
over O
! O

little O
short O
on O
RAM B-AS
but O
you O
get O
what O
you O
pay O
for O
. O

It O
did O
n't O
come O
with O
any O
software B-AS
installed O
outside O
of O
windows B-AS
media I-AS
, O
but O
for O
the O
price B-AS
, O
I O
was O
very O
pleased O
with O
the O
condition O
and O
the O
overall O
product O
. O

The O
first O
one O
I O
had O
was O
a O
2006 O
model O
, O
not O
the O
Pro O
. O

THEN O
, O
one O
month O
after O
the O
warranty B-AS
expired O
, O
the O
replacement B-AS
charger I-AS
went O
. O

2nd O
Mac O
book O
I O
have O
purchased O
from O
MacConnection O
. O

I O
love O
a O
pc O
but O
I O
was O
ready O
for O
a O
change O
and O
tired O
of O
the O
windows B-AS
system I-AS
. O

Your O
cursor B-AS
will O
end O
up O
all O
over O
the O
freaking O
place O
, O
, O
, O
it O
's O
not O
uncommon O
for O
me O
to O
accidentally O
delete O
words O
, O
sentences O
, O
paragraphs O
because O
of O
this O
mousepad B-AS
. O

Other O
installed O
features B-AS
, O
such O
as O
certain O
printer B-AS
software I-AS
, O
are O
also O
most O
attractive O
. O

I O
normally O
do O
n't O
participate O
in O
reviews O
/ O
surveys O
but O
this O
laptop O
has O
not O
given O
me O
any O
problems O
and O
hope O
to O
share O
my O
thoughts O
. O

Most O
of O
the O
large O
bags O
are O
for O
a O
17 O
inch O
. O

I O
work O
in O
film O
editing O
and O
post O
production O
, O
so O
I O
need O
a O
laptop O
that O
not O
only O
has O
power B-AS
, O
but O
memory B-AS
and O
speed B-AS
as O
well O
. O

I O
took O
it O
home O
and O
within O
30 O
min O
, O
it O
was O
freezing O
up O
and O
did O
the O
blue O
screen O
of O
death O
. O

At O
first O
when O
I O
got O
this O
product O
, O
I O
loved O
it O
. O

I O
think O
this O
computer O
is O
super O
lame O
. O

It O
had O
a O
seventeen O
inch O
screen O
which O
I O
wanted O
, O
but O
I O
did O
n't O
realize O
at O
the O
time O
it O
would O
be O
such O
a O
monster O
! O

Even O
doing O
so O
, O
the O
hinge B-AS
may O
just O
be O
slightly O
tightened O
only O
. O

company O
provides O
UPS O
shipping B-AS
, O
fast O
, O
great O
! O

I O
would O
tell O
the O
technician B-AS
I O
knew O
exactly O
what O
was O
wrong O
with O
it O
but O
they O
did O
not O
listen O
and O
I O
had O
to O
go O
through O
a O
bunch O
of O
junk O
to O
get O
them O
to O
tell O
me O
I O
needed O
to O
send O
the O
computer O
in O
. O

THIS O
is O
what O
a O
laptop O
is O
supposed O
to O
be O
. O

Then O
I O
' O
ve O
fixed O
the O
DC B-AS
jack I-AS
inside O
the O
unit O
, O
rewired O
the O
DC B-AS
jack I-AS
to O
the O
OUTside O
of O
the O
laptop O
, O
replaced O
the O
power B-AS
brick I-AS
. O

I O
purchased O
two O
laptops O
for O
my O
husband O
and O
16 O
year O
old O
daughter O
. O

More O
relieved O
than O
anything O
. O

It O
is O
easy O
to O
use B-AS
, O
has O
great O
screen B-AS
quality I-AS
, O
and O
every O
so O

Great O

laptop O
is O
fabulous O
in O
both O
areas O
. O

pros O
, O
the O
macbook O
pro O
notebook O
has O
a O
large O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
and O
you O
wo O
nt O
have O
to O
worry O
to O
charge O
your O
laptop O
every O
five O
hours O
or O
so O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
this O
product O
! O

Disappointing O
for O
such O
a O
lovely O
screen B-AS
and O
at O
a O
reasonable O
price B-AS

So O
far O
, O
it O
's O
an O
average O
laptop O
, O
no O
better O
, O
no O
worse O
than O
the O
HP O
I O
replaced O
. O

The O
only O
bad O
thing O
about O
it O
is O
they O
give O
you O
the O
worst O
batteries B-AS
possible O
. O

Good O
price B-AS
. O

THE O
MOTHERBOARD B-AS
IS O
DEAD O
! O

I O
wanted O
to O
spend O
around O
$ O
700 O
to O
$ O
800 O
so O
I O
was O
directed O
to O
a O
nice O
looking O
HP O
Laptop O
. O

the O
speed B-AS
is O
fine O
. O

I O
was O
starting O
to O
boil O
. O

Hmmm O
, O
that O
high O
failure O
rate O
sure O
is O
n't O
reflected O
in O
the O
retail B-AS
price I-AS
. O

BAck O
she O
goes O
! O

It O
was O
not O
clear O
that O
the O
Microsoft B-AS
Student I-AS
Edition I-AS
that O
was O
loaded O
on O
the O
computer O
, O
was O
a O
six O
month O
trial O
. O

not O
the O
day O
received O
. O

Good O
for O
every B-AS
day I-AS
computing I-AS
and O
web B-AS
browsing I-AS
. O

While O
lacking O
some O
of O
the O
functions O
of O
the O
other O
versions O
, O
this O
was O
very O
acceptable O
for O
the O
uses O
planned O
for O
this O
computer O
. O

Also O
, O
I O
have O
had O
alot O
of O
trouble O
with O
the O
keys B-AS
sticking O
and O
will O
not O
type O
correctly O
. O

It O
still O
seems O
to O
be O
a O
little O
lose O
now O
but O
so O
far O
seems O
to O
be O
hanging O
in O
there O
. O

It O
is O
by O
far O
one O
of O
the O
greatest O
investments O
I O
have O
ever O
made O
. O

If O
you O
are O
a O
PC O
user O
looking O
to O
convert O
I O
would O
HIGHLY O
recommend O
it O
! O

Excellent O
LED B-AS
monitor I-AS
and O
well O
equipped O
. O

This O
process O
continued O
to O
repeat O
itself O
until O
the O
mother B-AS
board I-AS
had O
been O
replaced O
4 O
times O
and O
the O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
replaced O
3 O
times O
. O

Without O
a O
doubt O
, O
the O
* O
ASPECT0 O
* O
of O
this O
laptop O
is O
fantastic O
. O

I O
could O
n't O
believe O
how O
long O
the O
battery B-AS
lasted O
on O
a O
single O
charge B-AS
. O

I O
could O
save O
ten O
essay O
papers O
and O
have O
hardly O
any O
memory B-AS
left O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
had O
my O
Macbook O
Pro O
since O
August O
2009 O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
the O
laptop O
I O
purchased O
was O
also O
a O
Dell O
and O
again O
, O
I O
have O
to O
say O
i O
hated O
it O
. O

Took O
a O
while O
to O
clean O
it O
up O
to O
my O
specs O
. O

They O
are O
so O
realistic O
I O
am O
just O
speechless O
. O

Other O
than O
that O
, O
I O
would O
recommend O
this O
to O
someone O
in O
need O
of O
a O
cheap O
laptop O
with O
semi O
- O
decent O
gaming B-AS
capabilities O
. O

This O
is O
the O
first O
time O
that O
I O
tried O
and O
owning O
a O
netbook O
although O
I O
have O
used O
3 O
different O
laptops O
in O
the O
past O
10 O
years O
, O
I O
find O
not O
much O
difference O
except O
of O
course O
for O
the O
screen B-AS
size I-AS
. O

But O
the O
biggest O
pain O
is O
that O
tech B-AS
support I-AS
is O
not O
available O
24/7 O
. O

There O
are O
differences O
that O
you O
need O
to O
know O
and O
take O
time O
to O
learn O
. O

They O
have O
more O
problems O
then O
a O
1980 O
's O
computer O
. O

It O
is O
amazing O
. O

Needless O
to O
say O
, O
not O
to O
happy O
with O
the O
product O
. O

The O
cool O
thing O
about O
this O
is O
anyone O
can O
use O
it O
. O

My O
first O
laptop O
was O
an O
Acer O
that O
I O
got O
for O
Christmas O
. O

Still O
, O
this O
laptop O
is O
perfect O
for O
all O
day O
use O
at O
school O
and O
work O
. O

the O
internet O
can O
be O
an O
scary O
place O
its O
up O
to O
you O
on O
what O
you O
do O
with O
it O
. O

The O
backlit B-AS
keys I-AS
are O
wonderful O
when O
you O
are O
working O
in O
the O
dark O
. O

I O
chose O
the O
iBookG4 O
, O
a O
laptop O
that O
is O
an O
attractive O
computer O
with O
a O
large O
screen B-AS
big O
enough O
to O
please O
anyone O
. O

The O
most O
recent O
being O
that O
my O
Safari B-AS
internet I-AS
browser I-AS
is O
freaking O
out O
on O
me O
, O
but O
I O
have O
just O
been O
using O
firefox B-AS
instead O
. O

I O
would O
say O
if O
you O
want O
to O
buy O
one O
of O
these O
machines O
be O
careful O
. O

Everything O
about O
the O
Mac O
is O
not O
only O
visually O
appealing O
, O
but O
very O
easy O
to O
use B-AS
. O

I O
know O
what O
7 O
hrs O
of O
battery B-AS
looks O
like O
. O

The O
Macbooks O
worth O
every O
penny O
. O

I O
did O
not O
have O
to O
call O
the O
support B-AS
line I-AS
at O
all O
. O

The O
laptop O
is O
outstanding O
in O
all O
aspects O
except O
that O
it O
has O
the O
Windows B-AS
7 I-AS
starter I-AS
and O
not O
the O
full O
Windows B-AS
7 I-AS
. O

THE O
FIRST O
PROBLEM O
IS O
THAT O
THE O
KEYBOARD B-AS
FUNCTION I-AS
IS O
SIMPLY O
UNSATISFACTORY O
. O

The O
DVD B-AS
drive I-AS
randomly O
pops O
open O
when O
it O
is O
in O
my O
backpack O
as O
well O
, O
which O
is O
annoying O
. O

Garageband B-AS
is O
more O
for O
the O
musicians O
, O
and O
the O
laptop O
is O
equipped O
with O
a O
good O
working O
microphone B-AS
, O
good O
enough O
for O
beginners O
and O
musicians O
at O
the O
intermediate O
level O
. O

I O
dual O
boot O
with O
Linux B-AS
and O
that O
other O
security B-AS
- I-AS
prone I-AS
OS I-AS
and O
it O
performs B-AS
flawlessly O
. O

The O
difference O
is O
the O
Toshiba O
had O
a O
lot O
more O
memory B-AS
and O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
space I-AS
. O

But O
if O
you O
ca O
n't O
make O
your O
product O
last O
more O
than O
a O
year O
, O
you O
will O
not O
get O
my O
business O
again O
. O

There O
was O
a O
little O
difficulty O
doing O
the O
migration O
as O
the O
firewire B-AS
cable I-AS
system I-AS
ca O
n't O
be O
used O
with O
the O
iBook B-AS
. O

Seems O
like O
maybe O
a O
bad O
shipment B-AS
from O
Toshiba O
. O

Do O
n't O
waste O
your O
money O
! O

Currently O
if O
I O
use O
the O
laptop O
I O
ca O
n't O
sit O
it O
on O
my O
lap O
because O
it O
will O
burn O
my O
legs O
. O

-Managed O
to O
send O
complaint O
email O
. O

however O
, O
they O
were O
kind O
enough O
to O
send O
a O
replacement O
free O
of O
charge O
. O

Seriously O
considering O
a O
larger O
laptop O
to O
replace O
the O
Dell O

OS B-AS
X I-AS
is O
solid O
with O
lots O
of O
innovations O
such O
as O
quicklook B-AS
which O
save O
heaps O
of O
time O
. O

I O
do O
everything O
on O
this O
computer O
, O
check O
email O
, O
facebook O
, O
shop O
, O
check O
blogs O
, O
write O
papers O
, O
listen O
to O
music O
, O
and O
we O
even O
watch O
all O
of O
our O
movies O
on O
it O
since O
we O
do O
not O
have O
a O
tv O
. O

I O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
a O
simple O
job O
. O

But O
other O
than O
that O
I O
am O
blown O
away O
by O
all O
the O
features B-AS
this O
laptop O
offers O
. O

I O
Hate O
it O
! O

Do O
n't O
buy O
this O
model O
. O

The O
keyboard B-AS
is O
slick O
and O
quiet O
and O
not O
bulky O
like O
some O
other O
laptops O
I O
have O
had O
in O
the O
past O
. O

I O
can O
leave O
my O
MacBook O
uncharged O
for O
upwards O
of O
eight O
hours O
and O
it O
wo O
n't O
even O
be O
dead O
. O

Overall O
, O
this O
laptop O
is O
definitely O
a O
keeper O
with O
its O
simple O
yet O
stylish O
design B-AS
and O
its O
array O
of O
fantastic O
colors B-AS
to O
choose O
from O
. O

I O
do O
find O
that O
my O
MacBook O
has O
a O
lot O
more O
bells O
and O
whistles O
than O
a O
normal O
PC O
especially O
if O
you O
enjoy O
technology O
, O
downloading O
pictures O
and O
graphic O
design O
. O

First O
the O
screen B-AS
goes O
completely O
out O
. O

I O
' O
m O
learning O
the O
finger O
options O
for O
the O
mousepad B-AS
that O
allow O
for O
quicker O
browsing B-AS
of O
web O
pages O
. O

I O
love O
this O
13 O
Mac O
white O
unibody O
. O

the O
last O
time O
we O
took O
it O
to O
get O
fixed O
the O
guy O
said O
that O
most O
likely O
it O
is O
a O
reppative O
problem O
and O
will O
keep O
happeneing O
so O
hopefully O
we O
can O
get O
a O
new O
one O
very O
soon O
! O

When O
I O
am O
at O
Starbucks O
between O
clients O
I O
get O
full O
bars O
on O
my O
HP O
and O
1 O
bar O
on O
my O
Eee O
PC O
. O

The O
PhotoBooth B-AS
is O
a O
great O
program B-AS
, O
it O
takes O
very O
good O
pictures O
with O
the O
built B-AS
- I-AS
in I-AS
camera I-AS
. O

And O
inconvenient O
! O

Many O
kinds O
of O
software B-AS
that O
is O
necessary O
to O
the O
working O
person O
is O
not O
available O
and O
can O
not O
be O
downloaded O
. O

It O
is O
so O
speedy O
. O

Needs O
constant O
repair O
. O

I O
will O
never O
purchase O
a O
HP O
again O
ever O
. O

I O
had O
to O
pay O
for O
the O
shipping B-AS
! O

It O
bluescreened O
on O
me O
without O
any O
warning O
, O
running O
simply O
basic O
Chrome B-AS
. O

This O
is O
another O
reason O
to O
like O
the O
Mac O
. O

I O
took O
3 O
- O
4 O
years O
researching O
brands O
and O
prices B-AS
of O
laptops O
. O

One O
bad O
thing O
is O
it O
gets O
hot O
. O

I O
' O
m O
stuck O
w/ O
a O
broken O
computer O
. O

We O
researched O
and O
found O
the O
best O
price B-AS
at O
MacConnection O
. O

Hope O
this O
helps O
! O

But O
guess O
what O
? O
you O
have O
to O
buy O
an O
external B-AS
dvd I-AS
drive I-AS
it O
does O
n't O
have O
a O
built O
in O
type O
The O
notebook O
ca O
n't O
be O
used O
because O
it O
does O
n't O
read O
anything O
for O
an O
external B-AS
drive I-AS
. O

GET O
THIS O
COMPUTER O
FOR O
PORTABILITY B-AS
AND O
FAST O
PROCESSING B-AS
! O
! O
! O

Apparently O
they O
're O
not O
special O
anymore O
. O

I O
use O
a O
cooling B-AS
pad I-AS
but O
it O
does O
n't O
help O
. O

I O
' O
m O
so O
glad O
I O
purchased O
a O
Mac O
and O
not O
another O
PC O
! O
! O
! O

99 O
to O
fix O
it O
. O

Few O
viruses O
to O
catch O
; O

Supplied B-AS
software I-AS
, O
The O
software B-AS
that O
comes O
with O
this O
machine O
is O
greatly O
welcomed O
compared O
to O
what O
Windows B-AS
comes O
with O
. O

Steve O
Jobs O
, O
probably O
needs O
help O
and O
donations O
, O
and O
can O
not O
afford O
a O
reasonable O
offers O
for O
people O
that O
truly O
are O
trying O
to O
support O
his O
baby O
. O

I O
' O
m O
tired O
of O
the O
inept O
service B-AS
. O

Garageband B-AS
is O
easy O
to O
work O
with O
, O
like O
all O
the O
other O
apple B-AS
applications I-AS
I O
' O
ve O
had O
experience O
with O
. O

No O
, O
tey O
do O
n't O
even O
support O
their O
own O
bios B-AS
and O
it O
could O
be O
a O
problem O
with O
the O
bios B-AS
How O
can O
a O
company O
that O
makes O
a O
fairly O
decent O
product O
get O
away O
with O
such O
insanity O
? O
? O
! O
! O

While O
many O
people O
brag O
about O
Mac O
being O
intuitive O
, O
it O
does O
take O
a O
little O
time O
to O
adjust O
to O
coming O
from O
a O
PC O
, O
but O
once O
I O
got O
the O
hang O
of O
it O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
go O
back O
. O

Because O
we O
did O
not O
purchase O
the O
extended B-AS
warranty I-AS
in O
time O
, O
we O
are O
on O
the O
hook O
for O
the O
repair O
. O

It O
started O
out O
by O
randomly O
ceasing O
to O
charge B-AS
when O
it O
was O
plugged O
in O
mousing O
over O
the O
battery O
icon O
would O
read O
, O
for O
example O
, O
74 O
% O
, O
plugged O
in O
, O
not O
charging B-AS
, O
requiring O
me O
to O
unplug O
it O
and O
plug O
it O
back O
in O
several O
times O
to O
get O
it O
to O
charge B-AS
. O

This O
laptop O
looked O
brand O
new O
and O
was O
shipped B-AS
very O
quickly O
. O

If O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
something O
reliable O
, O
this O
is O
the O
laptop O
for O
you O
. O

Info O
, O
Windows B-AS
failed O
to O
load O
because O
the O
kernal B-AS
is O
missing O
, O
or O
corrupt O
. O

The O
display B-AS
on O
this O
computer O
is O
the O
best O
I O
' O
ve O
seen O
in O
a O
very O
long O
time O
, O
the O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
is O
very O
long O
and O
very O
convienent O
. O

Most O
laptops O
and O
notebooks O
are O
difficult O
to O
key O
on O
. O

We O
did O
n't O
because O
it O
was O
already O
over O
2,400 O
dollars O
! O

But O
the O
quality B-AS
, O
in O
general O
was O
less O
than O
the O
worth O
of O
the O
cheap O
laptop O
. O

In O
the O
first O
moth O
of O
owning O
this O
computer O
its O
hardrive B-AS
failed O
which O
had O
to O
be O
replaced O
. O

Its O
also O
FUN O
to O
use B-AS
! O

The O
graphics B-AS
and O
screen B-AS
are O
stunning O
and O
although O
I O
was O
a O
PC O
person O
, O
I O
was O
able O
to O
understand O
how O
to O
use O
a O
mac O
fairly O
quickly O
. O

WIth O
the O
upgraded B-AS
memory I-AS
, O
the O
MacBook O
Pro O
never O
has O
an O
issue O
running B-AS
many O
many O
applications B-AS
at O
once O
! O

Simple O
to O
use B-AS
, O
and O
great O
graphics B-AS
. O

It O
still O
serves O
me O
well O
both O
in O
business O
and O
home O
needs O
. O

I O
use O
my O
friends O
and O
family O
's O
$ O
2000 O
laptops O
and O
they O
are O
fast O
and O
reliable O
and O
HP O
, O
well O
, O
I O
'll O
never O
buy O
or O
recommend O
an O
HP O
to O
anyone O
! O

My O
MacBook O
is O
probably O
the O
best O
investment O
I O
have O
ever O
made O
. O

The O
internet B-AS
speed I-AS
is O
spectacular O
. O

They O
claim O
call B-AS
center I-AS
is O
still O
down O
. O

Mac O
also O
has O
many O
apps B-AS
and O
programs B-AS
that O
are O
quite O
cheap O
or O
free O
. O

If O
you O
shop O
around O
in O
the O
current O
market O
you O
can O
find O
a O
much O
better O
deal O
. O

I O
droped O
this O
once O
from O
thetable O
when O
my O
baby O
girl O
grabed O
me O
one O
day O
and O
IT O
is O
still O
working O
with O
NO O
issues O
! O

You O
will O
love O
this O
macbook O
if O
you O
choose O
to O
buy O
it O
. O

My O
house O
is O
now O
100 O
% O
Macbook O
. O

They O
're O
not O
safe O
, O
they O
're O
not O
durable O
, O
they O
just O
a O
worthless O
. O

My O
husband O
uses O
it O
mostly O
for O
games B-AS
, O
email O
and O
music O
. O

I O
have O
had O
no O
luck O
with O
staples O
or O
HP O
to O
resolve O
this O
problem O
. O

I O
just O
took O
the O
broken O
cords B-AS
into O
the O
Apple O
store O
and O
they O
gave O
me O
new O
ones O
. O

My O
Mac O
is O
much O
more O
efficient O
than O
a O
PC O
so O
it O
does O
not O
need O
the O
extra O
bells O
and O
whistles O
to O
compete O
. O

It O
WORKS O
! O

You O
just O
lose O
a O
customer O
. O

I O
ve O
had O
several O
calls O
lasting O
more O
than O
an O
hour O
with O
promises O
to O
call O
back O
, O
but O
the O
return O
calls O
never O
came O
. O

Apparently O
under O
the O
screen B-AS
there O
are O
2 O
little O
screws O
and O
when O
the O
screen B-AS
gets O
moved O
back O
and O
forth O
, O
they O
come O
loose O
. O

Being O
a O
PC O
user O
my O
whole O
life O
, O
it O
's O
taking O
a O
bit O
of O
time O
to O
adapt O
to O
the O
OS B-AS
of O
a O
Mac O
but O
I O
' O
m O
finding O
my O
way O
around O
. O

The O
computer O
will O
constantly O
be O
getting O
hot O
and O
burning O
your O
leg O
unless O
you O
go O
through O
the O
hassle O
of O
taking O
off O
the O
entire O
back O
of O
it O
just O
to O
clean O
out O
the O
fan B-AS
. O

I O
have O
in O
the O
past O
gotten O
superfine O
sandpaper O
and O
fixed O
the O
edges B-AS
by O
rounding O
them O
off O
. O

I O
hate O
it O
! O

returned O
it O
. O

Downfalls O
, O
sharp O
edges B-AS
. O

It O
is O
a O
cheap O
throw O
together O
. O

i O
needed O
one O
to O
be O
able O
to O
carry B-AS
to O
work O
everyday O
and O
this O
one O
seems O
to O
fit O
all O
of O
the O
criteria O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
Mac O
, O
and O
do O
, O
to O
anyone O
looking O
to O
buy O
a O
new O
computer O
. O

The O
screen B-AS
is O
gorgeous O
, O
yummy O
good O
. O

Did O
I O
mention O
everything O
about O
it O
, O
from O
size B-AS
to O
weight B-AS
to O
keyboard B-AS
screams O
BULK O
? O

Ca O
n't O
wait O
until O
I O
go O
on O
vacation O
and O
take O
it O
with O
me O
. O

Good O
bye O
BLUE O
SCREEN O
and O
Critical O
errors O
! O
! O
! O
! O

I O
had O
it O
four O
months O
when O
my O
disc B-AS
drive I-AS
refused O
to O
open O
. O

So O
, O
after O
Apple O
replaced O
the O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
I O
enjoyed O
another O
4 O
months O
of O
my O
new O
computer O
, O
until O
it O
froze O
this O
morning O
-- O
completely O
. O

Once O
again O
, O
I O
was O
told O
it O
was O
the O
suspicious O
power B-AS
supply I-AS
problem O
. O

It O
easily O
fits O
into O
most O
computer O
bags O
but O
does O
n't O
weigh O
down O
a O
backpack O
or O
satchel O
when O
being O
carried O
with O
spirals O
and/or O
textbooks O
. O

The O
Macbook O
starts B-AS
fast O
, O
does O
n't O
crash O
, O
has O
a O
fantastic O
display B-AS
, O
is O
small O
and O
light O
I O
have O
the O
133 O
model O
, O
and O
is O
n't O
always O
complaining O
about O
updates O
, O
lost O
connections O
, O
errors O
, O
blue O
screens O
, O
etc O
. O

It O
was O
kind O
of O
a O
rebellion O
against O
PC O
in O
fact O
, O
and O
I O
am O
certainly O
glad O
I O
did O
. O

Unable O
to O
boot B-AS
up I-AS
this O
brand O
new O
laptop O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
all O
the O
design O
tools O
on O
Pages B-AS
and O
Keynotes B-AS
makes O
it O
much O
easier O
to O
create O
professional O
looking O
documents O
and O
presentations O
. O

I O
actually O
had O
the O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
replaced O
twice O
, O
the O
mother B-AS
board I-AS
once O
, O
the O
dvd B-AS
drive I-AS
twice O
, O
then O
they O
FINALLY O
agreed O
to O
replace O
it O
, O
ALL O
OF O
THIS O
IN O
LESS O
THAN O
1 O
1/2 O
YEARS O
! O

I O
really O
do O
n't O
like O
it O
, O
but O
I O
am O
stuck O
. O

The O
guy O
then O
said O
that O
if O
I O
insist O
on O
having O
the O
hinge B-AS
tightened O
, O
they O
can O
do O
it O
for O
me O
but O
I O
have O
to O
accept O
the O
condition O
after O
the O
repair O
. O

The O
port B-AS
is O
secured O
to O
motherboard B-AS
so O
when O
this O
happens O
you O
ca O
n't O
see O
the O
plug B-AS
at O
all O
, O
it O
's O
just O
gone O
. O

-Stay O
away O
from O
MacHouse O
Amsterdam O
. O

Once O
again O
apple O
stands O
alone O
at O
the O
top O
of O
the O
charts O
. O

I O
love O
the O
feel O
of O
the O
key B-AS
board I-AS
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
trackpad B-AS
. O

Now O
I O
have O
the O
best O
of O
both O
worlds O
with O
all O
of O
the O
power B-AS
and O
ease B-AS
of O
the O
Mac O
! O

These O
new O
problems O
were O
the O
final O
straws O
; O

luckly O
i O
had O
a O
student O
task O
force O
able O
to O
help O
, O
or O
else O
it O
would O
have O
crashed O
within O
the O
first O
year O
. O

That O
seemed O
to O
solve O
the O
problem O
, O
till O
I O
wrote O
an O
article O
with O
semicolons O
in O
it O
. O

Ease O
of O
use B-AS
is O
just O
one O
of O
the O
benefits O
I O
love O
about O
my O
Mac O
. O

-ASPECT0 O
will O
take O
a O
bit O
of O
time O
to O
get O
used O
to O
. O

We O
both O
recently O
got O
new O
laptops O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
been O
a O
PC O
user O
and O
I O
just O
finally O
switched O
and O
I O
am O
never O
going O
back O
. O

I O
got O
the O
Macbook O
and O
he O
got O
a O
Macbook O
Pro O
. O

Winters O
is O
on O
it O
's O
way O
and O
I O
imagine O
it O
will O
be O
cozy O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
laptop O
about O
a O
month O
ago O
to O
replace O
my O
compaq O
laptop O
. O

Now O
the O
machine O
wo O
n't O
connect O
and O
Toshiba O
says O
that O
they O
did O
replace O
the O
connection B-AS
card I-AS
in O
May O
but O
they O
only O
warranty B-AS
the O
repair O
for O
30 O
days O
and O
now O
I O
' O
m O
out O
of O
warranty B-AS
even O
though O
this O
has O
been O
a O
constant O
5 O
month O
occurance O
since O
I O
bought O
the O
netbook O
. O

Will O
certainly O
use O
MacConnection O
again O
. O

But O
, O
buy O
this O
model O
and O
just O
purchase O
4 B-AS
GB I-AS
of I-AS
RAM I-AS
2x2 O
GB O
for O
$ O
92 O
or O
1x4 O
GB O
for O
$ O
99 O
, O
and O
save O
yourself O
$ O
100 O
than O
the O
other O
model O
with O
8 B-AS
GB I-AS
of I-AS
RAM I-AS
. O

this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
reasons O
I O
purchased O
it O
. O

Instead O
of O
taking O
another O
chance O
on O
Toshiba O
, O
I O
went O
with O
an O
Asus O
G73JH O
- O
x3 O
. O

She O
told O
me O
flatly O
, O
It O
's O
like O
that O
one O
. O

If O
you O
're O
looking O
for O
something O
to O
fly O
through O
those O
massive O
spreadsheets O
or O
play O
a O
graphics O
- O
intensive O
game B-AS
, O
you O
'd O
be O
better O
off O
getting O
a O
machine O
aimed O
at O
that O
segment O
of O
the O
market O
. O

It O
is O
the O
easiest O
computer O
I O
have O
ever O
used O

So O
you O
might O
ask O
, O
what O
did O
Apple O
do O
for O
me O
? O

Browsing B-AS
, O
also O
, O
was O
no O
problem O
for O
me O
when O
I O
used O
itunes B-AS
which O
usually O
slows O
down O
my O
PC O
. O

Should O
be O
there O
by O
the O
end O
of O
the O
week O
again O
. O

Again O
, O
decent O
comp O
for O
the O
price B-AS
, O
and O
I O
was O
in O
need O
of O
one O
quickly O
as O
my O
other O
laptop O
died O
on O
me O
. O

so O
in O
a O
brief O
summary O
i O
would O
have O
to O
say O
that O
i O
would O
not O
recommend O
dell O
vostro O
1000 O
to O
anyone O
due O
to O
it O
being O
a O
down O
right O
awful O
setup B-AS
so O
in O
my O
opinion O
you O
should O
steer O
clear O
of O
them O
if O
you O
want O
a O
decent O
laptop O
. O

I O
just O
got O
this O
laptop O
for O
college O
, O
and O
so O
far O
I O
am O
very O
happy O
with O
it O
. O

tosiba O
has O
a O
good O
reputation O
, O
my O
llast O
computer O
was O
an O
acer O
. O

My O
friend O
just O
had O
to O
replace O
his O
entire O
motherboard B-AS
, O
so O
did O
my O
wife O
, O
and O
it O
looks O
like O
I O
will O
have O
to O
as O
well O
. O

Toshiba B-AS
customer I-AS
services I-AS
will O
indirectly O
deal O
with O
your O
problems O
by O
constantly O
tranferring O
you O
from O
one O
country O
to O
another O
, O
and O
I O
am O
not O
kidding O
you O
, O
I O
called O
different O
hours O
of O
the O
day O
and O
you O
'll O
get O
someone O
else O
from O
another O
country O
trying O
to O
get O
you O
to O
tell O
them O
your O
life O
story O
all O
over O
again O
, O
since O
they O
make O
it O
sound O
like O
they O
do O
n't O
have O
your O
history O
list O
of O
your O
calls O
right O
in O
front O
of O
them O
. O

Quality B-AS
Display I-AS
I O
was O
surprised O
with O
the O
performance B-AS
and O
quality B-AS
of O
this O
HP O
Laptop O
. O

The O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
also O
does O
n't O
keep O
up O
with O
the O
claim O
but O
still O
I O
think O
macbook O
is O
much O
ahead O
from O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
pack O
. O

The O
internet B-AS
capabilities I-AS
are O
also O
very O
strong O
and O
picks O
up O
signals O
very O
easily O
. O

Its O
fast O
, O
has O
High B-AS
definition I-AS
quality I-AS
in O
the O
videos O
. O

They O
transfer O
you O
around O
to O
other O
people O
who O
do O
not O
understand O
what O
you O
are O
saying O
and O
you O
ca O
n't O
understand O
what O
they O
are O
saying O
. O

Speakers O
do O
n't O
get O
that O
loud O
, O
but O
good O
enough O
. O

I O
have O
had O
it O
9 O
months O
and O
it O
is O
already O
a O
$ O
250 O
loss O
. O

Another O
Great O
thing O
is O
the O
Beast B-AS
graphics I-AS
. O

I O
was O
WRONG O
! O

The O
ease O
of O
set B-AS
up I-AS
was O
terrific O
. O

Everything O
I O
have O
tried O
has O
worked O
and O
I O
never O
have O
to O
carry O
the O
wall B-AS
charger I-AS
cause O
the O
battery B-AS
is O
so O
awesome O
. O

Screen O
is O
crystal O
clear O
, O
yes O
it O
's O
small O
, O
but O
it O
's O
a O
netbook O
! O

So O
this O
review O
might O
be O
a O
tad O
bit O
bias O
. O

This O
was O
around O
three O
years O
, O
maybe O
four O
years O
ago O
. O

The O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
is O
probably O
an O
hour O
at O
best O
. O

This O
is O
a O
review O
of O
windows B-AS
vista I-AS
system I-AS
. O

She O
said O
its O
very O
user O
friendly O
. O

Kind O
of O
annoying O
, O
but O
I O
still O
love O
the O
laptop O
. O

cosmetically O
, O
the O
only O
thing O
they O
changed O
was O
2 O
of O
the O
Function B-AS
keys I-AS
at O
the O
top O
. O

I O
am O
very O
happy O
I O
bought O
this O
Mac O
, O
well O
worth O
the O
extra O
money O
. O

But O
sadly O
the O
replacement O
froze O
- O
up O
while O
updating O
the O
BIOS B-AS
again O
and O
shut O
down O
and O
would O
not O
turn O
back O
on O
. O

There O
's O
literally O
no O
way O
to O
make O
it O
sing O
with O
Vista B-AS
. O

After O
looking O
at O
all O
the O
pros O
and O
cons O
, O
I O
decided O
on O
the O
Macbook O
Pro O
. O

Screen B-AS
size I-AS
is O
perfect O
for O
portable O
use O
in O
any O
environment O
. O

First O
, O
it O
does O
not O
have O
a O
push B-AS
button I-AS
to O
open O
the O
lid B-AS
. O

Hope O
this O
helped O
! O

I O
used O
to O
build O
my O
own O
desktops O
from O
the O
component O
parts O
, O
and O
recently O
my O
7 O
year O
old O
Pentium B-AS
4 I-AS
with O
HT O
1 B-AS
GB I-AS
ram I-AS
SATA O
desktop O
stopped O
working O
this O
was O
a O
rock O
star O
7 O
years O
ago O
. O

I O
now O
realize O
that O
my O
$ O
900 O
would O
have O
been O
better O
spent O
on O
a O
Windows B-AS
laptop O
. O

Please O
, O
anyone O
who O
is O
considering O
getting O
this O
computer O
, O
stop O
. O

This O
laptop O
serves O
all O
my O
needs O
. O

And O
printing O
from O
either O
word B-AS
processor I-AS
is O
an O
adventure O
. O

Very O
satisfied O
. O

Do O
not O
buy O
it O
! O

-Estimated O
time O
to O
fix O
it O
, O
10 O
working O
days O
or O
less O
. O

After O
purchasing O
this O
thing O
, O
I O
find O
out O
that O
I O
need O
a O
special O
interface B-AS
device I-AS
to O
connect O
my O
camera O
, O
and O
that O
it O
can O
not O
be O
purchased O
at O
the O
store O
, O
only O
on O
line O
. O

I O
had O
my O
computer O
custom O
built O
from O
Sonystylecom O
. O

Another O
included B-AS
program I-AS
that O
is O
laughable O
is O
the O
chess O
game O
. O

Yes O
, O
I O
thought O
the O
expese B-AS
was O
a O
little O
much O
, O
but O
I O
now O
realize O
you O
get O
what O
you O
pay O
for O
. O

It O
works O
great O
for O
general O
internet B-AS
use I-AS
, O
Microsoft B-AS
Office I-AS
apps I-AS
, O
home O
bookkeeping O
, O
etc O
. O

I O
will O
not O
buy O
another O
one O
. O

Time O
will O
tell O
. O

The O
price B-AS
was O
very O
good O
, O
and O
the O
product O
is O
top O
quality B-AS
. O

This O
computer O
is O
really O
fast O
and O
I O
' O
m O
shocked O
as O
to O
how O
easy O
it O
is O
to O
get O
used O
to O
. O

It O
played O
various O
games B-AS
without O
problems O
and O
ran O
aero B-AS
smoothly O
and O
flawlessly O
. O

After O
replacing O
the O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
the O
battery B-AS
stopped O
working O
3 O
months O
of O
use O
which O
was O
frustrating O
. O

The O
screen B-AS
almost O
looked O
like O
a O
barcode O
when O
it O
froze O
. O

I O
have O
found O
a O
lot O
of O
online O
sources O
to O
help O
me O
but O
think O
that O
I O
would O
have O
learned O
a O
lot O
quicker O
if O
I O
would O
have O
taken O
the O
class O
. O

From O
the O
get O
- O
go O
, O
the O
M6809 O
was O
unsteady O
in O
its O
operation B-AS
; O

She O
tells O
me O
about O
it O
all O
the O
time O
but O
I O
tend O
to O
shut O
off O
all O
cognitive O
functions O
when O
she O
gets O
that O
yapper O
going O
. O

I O
could O
not O
even O
put O
my O
entire O
music O
collection O
on O
this O
garabage O
. O

One O
of O
the O
wonderful O
things O
about O
Macs O
is O
that O
they O
are O
virus O
free O
. O

Its O
small O
enough O
where O
I O
can O
take O
it O
pretty O
much O
anywhere O
, O
but O
still O
has O
a O
big O
enough O
screen B-AS
to O
get O
everything O
done O
. O

It O
even O
has O
a O
great O
webcam B-AS
, O
and O
Skype B-AS
works O
very O
well O
. O

I O
love O
the O
solid O
machined B-AS
aluminum I-AS
frame I-AS
, O
and O
the O
keyboard B-AS
is O
the O
best O
of O
any O
laptop O
I O
' O
ve O
used O
. O

You O
can O
even O
run O
a O
parallels B-AS
type I-AS
program I-AS
easily O
and O
run O
any O
leftover O
PC O
software B-AS
that O
you O
absolutely O
can O
not O
be O
without O
. O

This O
computer O
I O
used O
daily O
nice O
compact O
design B-AS
. O

The O
ATI B-AS
graphics I-AS
card I-AS
is O
a O
huge O
plus O
, O
definitely O
a O
good O
value O
if O
you O
need O
to O
be O
able O
to O
run O
some O
slightly O
older O
games B-AS
that O
a O
Intel B-AS
built I-AS
- I-AS
in I-AS
card I-AS
would O
have O
trouble O
with O
, O
such O
as O
Half O
- O
Life O
2 O
or O
even O
World O
of O
Warcraft O
. O

I O
practically O
have O
a O
new O
laptop O
with O
all O
the O
fixes O
they O
have O
done O
! O

Finally O
, O
I O
purchased O
a O
Toshiba O
. O

It O
was O
hard O
to O
handle B-AS
and O
operate B-AS
at O
school O
. O

You O
may O
just O
lose O
1 O
customer O
for O
now O
. O

It O
has O
easy O
to O
use O
features B-AS
and O
all O
the O
speed B-AS
and O
power B-AS
I O
could O
ask O
for O
. O

My O
power B-AS
supply I-AS
cord I-AS
developed O
exposed O
wires O
within O
the O
first O
year O
of O
ownership O
, O
so O
it O
was O
covered O
by O
the O
Applecare B-AS
warranty I-AS
plan I-AS
. O

Many O
thanks O
, O
Overstockcom O
. O

I O
love O
it O
and O
the O
change O
in O
lifestyle O
that O
came O
with O
it O
. O

only O
to O
get O
another O
HP O
/ O
Compaq O
piece O
of O
crap O
. O

I O
preferred O
the O
fit O
and O
feel O
of O
the O
13 B-AS
inch I-AS
. O

power B-AS
supply I-AS
went O
bad O
after O
2 O
weeks O
-- O

Emachines O
says O
they O
're O
waiting O
for O
a O
part O
and O
refuses O
to O
replace O
entire O
unit O
. O

The O
screen B-AS
takes O
some O
getting O
use O
to O
, O
because O
it O
is O
smaller O
than O
the O
laptop O
. O

I O
regret O
buying O
it O
before O
understanding O
how O
awful O
it O
is O
to O
use B-AS
. O

The O
right B-AS
speaker I-AS
did O
not O
work O
. O

Dealing O
with O
the O
support B-AS
drone O
on O
the O
other O
end O
of O
the O
chat O
was O
sheer O
torture O
. O

The O
Final B-AS
Cut I-AS
Pro I-AS
on O
this O
laptop O
is O
so O
fast O
and O
easy O
, O
and O
I O
can O
use O
this O
to O
seemlessly O
transfer O
all O
my O
work O
to O
my O
home O
computer O
, O
which O
is O
also O
a O
mac O
. O

The O
computer O
runs B-AS
extremely O
slowly O
, O
whether O
opening O
Word O
or O
My O
Computer O
. O

But O
I O
am O
glad O
to O
have O
gotten O
mine O
right O
before O
they O
stopped O
making O
it O
. O

The O
Mac B-AS
Snow I-AS
Leopard I-AS
O I-AS
/ I-AS
S I-AS
is O
extremely O
easy O
to O
use B-AS
, O
although O
very O
different O
than O
Win B-AS
XP I-AS
, O
Visa B-AS
or O
Win7 B-AS
. O

A O
tip O
for O
people O
looking O
into O
this O
computer O
, O
DO O
NOT O
BUY O
IT O
save O
up O
a O
bit O
more O
money O
and O
buy O
a O
computer O
that O
will O
last O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
always O
used O
PC O
's O
for O
work O
home O
and O
this O
is O
my O
first O
experience O
with O
a O
Mac O
. O

i O
asked O
many O
people O
, O
search O
on O
the O
net O
and O
also O
read O
reviews O
here O
in O
best O
buy O
. O

Startup B-AS
in O
about O
30 O
seconds O
, O
shutdown B-AS
in O
2 O
- O
4 O
seconds O
, O
resume B-AS
from I-AS
sleep I-AS
in O
0 O
- O
2 O
seconds O
. O

The O
screen B-AS
is O
nice O
and O
the O
images O
comes O
very O
clear O
, O
the O
keyboard B-AS
and O
the O
fit B-AS
just O
feels O
right O
. O

I O
returned O
it O
to O
Best O
Buy O
on O
the O
ninteenth O
of O
April O
. O

I O
have O
only O
had O
PCs O
with O
Windows B-AS
before O
so O
this O
takes O
a O
little O
getting O
use O
to O
. O

I O
was O
so O
excited O
to O
receive O
the O
Toshiba O
L455 O
as O
a O
gift O
/ O
bonus O
for O
some O
work O
I O
had O
done O
for O
a O
friend O
of O
mine O
! O

I O
had O
left O
my O
regular O
laptop O
at O
home O
and O
needed O
something O
to O
use O
while O
out O
of O
town O
. O

Summary O
, O
After O
doing O
some O
investigation O
on O
the O
web O
, O
I O
have O
found O
that O
Toshiba O
NB205s O
are O
not O
chronically O
not O
booting O
. O

super O
fast O
processor B-AS
and O
really O
nice O
graphics B-AS
card I-AS
. O

But O
sitting O
on O
a O
lap O
or O
on O
a O
desk O
in O
front O
of O
you O
it O
looks O
more O
than O
big O
enough O
this O
could O
be O
because O
I O
m O
used O
to O
my O
Lenovo O
10 O
tablet O
now O
plus O
this O
is O
a O
great O
size B-AS
if O
I O
want O
to O
unplug O
the O
external B-AS
keyboard I-AS
, O
mouse B-AS
, O
and O
monitor B-AS
to O
take O
it O
with O
me O
when O
I O
take O
photos O
and O
video O
. O

I O
Contacted O
HP O
about O
this O
situation O
and O
was O
given O
excuses O
, O
without O
results O
. O

You O
know O
what O
? O
I O
happened O
to O
buy O
a O
defective O
blood O
pressure O
monitor O
a O
week O
ago O
at O
the O
Bukit O
Batok O
Polyclinic O
NHG O
Pharmacy O
a O
week O
ago O
. O

The O
only O
objection O
I O
have O
is O
that O
after O
you O
buy O
it O
the O
windows B-AS
7 I-AS
system I-AS
is O
a O
starter O
and O
charges O
for O
the O
upgrade O
. O

I O
dislike O
the O
weight B-AS
and O
size B-AS
, O
cubersome O
. O

The O
wheel B-AS
that O
turns O
the O
volume O
up O
and O
down O
does O
n't O
work O
in O
real O
time O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
even O
install O
one O
of O
the O
3 O
printers O
I O
have O
in O
my O
house O
so O
I O
am O
unable O
to O
print O
. O

I O
can O
not O
be O
happier O
with O
the O
service B-AS
or O
product O
. O

Everything O
was O
so O
easy O
. O

To O
list O
a O
few O
, O
They O
tend O
to O
get O
hot O
enough O
to O
cause O
3rd O
degree O
burns O
, O
as O
well O
as O
ignite O
any O
flamable O
material O
if O
near O
the O
part O
that O
happens O
to O
heat O
up O
. O

Got O
this O
for O
a O
graduation O
gift O
for O
my O
daughter O
for O
her O
to O
use O
at O
college O
. O

I O
do O
transcription O
work O
on O
the O
side O
, O
and O
the O
flatline B-AS
keyboard I-AS
makes O
typing O
quick O
and O
easy O
as O
well O
. O

After O
5 O
months O
of O
failed O
repairs O
, O
requested O
a O
full O
refund O
but O
was O
refused O
and O
it O
still O
is O
not O
repaired O
and O
Acer O
is O
indifferent O
to O
the O
issue O
. O

The O
Toshiba O
laptop O
was O
a O
great O
purchase O
. O

After O
years O
of O
using O
PCs O
, O
a O
new O
Mac O
user O
is O
basically O
forced O
to O
re O
- O
learn O
how O
to O
use O
a O
computer O
. O

Speakers B-AS
does O
n't O
sound O
that O
great O
. O

You O
better O
believe O
my O
next O
computer O
will O
be O
a O
MAC O
! O

I O
love O
it O
! O

I O
love O
windows B-AS
7 I-AS
but O
i O
ca O
n't O
give O
Toshiba O
any O
credit O
for O
that O
, O
unless O
y' O
all O
get O
serious O
about O
ergonomics B-AS
and O
making O
required O
connections B-AS
less O
obtrusive O
i O
will O
be O
looking O
to O
different O
manufacturer O
next O
time O
. O

Now O
that O
I O
have O
it O
I O
see O
that O
I O
really O
needed O
this O
for O
much O
more O
. O

After O
numerous O
calls O
to O
Applecare B-AS
tech I-AS
support I-AS
, O
I O
was O
directed O
to O
send O
in O
my O
computer O
; O

The O
abuse O
is O
that O
I O
pushed O
the O
power B-AS
plug I-AS
in O
too O
hard O
. O

It O
is O
easy O
to O
find O
documents O
, O
and O
keep O
them O
in O
one O
area O
. O

The O
resolution B-AS
on I-AS
the I-AS
screen I-AS
is O
almost O
pure O
HD O
. O

With O
all O
the O
programs B-AS
that O
came O
with O
it O
, O
such O
as O
iLife B-AS
and O
iWork B-AS
, O
I O
was O
set O
from O
the O
very O
beginning O
. O

Not O
sure O
how O
I O
recommend O
it O
for O
quality O
gaming B-AS
, O
as O
I O
have O
a O
desktop O
rig O
for O
that O
reason O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
netbook O
for O
traveling O
, O
and O
it O
's O
great O
, O
light O
, O
functional O
, O
and O
meets O
my O
needs O
. O

Easy O
learning O
curve O
. O

I O
go O
to O
purchase O
it O
on O
line O
, O
and O
I O
find O
out O
that O
the O
device O
will O
not O
be O
available O
until O
almost O
two O
months O
later O
! O

dell O
is O
a O
decently O
made O
pc O
. O

Great O
value B-AS
, O
fast O
delivery B-AS
Computer O
works O
as O
if O
brand O
new O
, O
no O
problems O
, O
very O
pleased O

The O
Internet B-AS
Explorer I-AS
was O
very O
slow O
from O
the O
very O
beginning O
. O

The O
AC B-AS
power I-AS
port I-AS
becomes O
loose O
over O
time O

Best O
Buy O
laughed O
when O
I O
told O
them O
they O
should O
replace O
it O
instead O
of O
expecting O
me O
to O
be O
without O
a O
computer O
again O
for O
another O
couple O
of O
weeks O
. O

As O
a O
user O
of O
a O
PC O
, O
I O
will O
will O
admit O
that O
the O
macBook O
Pro O
has O
a O
better O
running B-AS
system I-AS
in O
which O
I O
found O
myself O
Getting O
the O
job O
done O
quicker O
. O

The O
computer O
would O
not O
ever O
cut O
back O
on O
. O

The O
ease O
in O
which O
you O
set O
everything O
up O
is O
such O
that O
a O
child O
could O
do O
it O
. O

i O
would O
have O
to O
say O
that O
overall O
its O
great O
! O

There O
are O
no O
gold O
key O
numbers O
too O
intall O
programs B-AS
, O
you O
must O
use O
the O
serial O
numbers O
that O
it O
does O
not O
accept O
and O
then O
things O
are O
limited O
as O
far O
a O
working O
because O
they O
are O
only O
good O
for O
a O
short O
time O
. O

and O
they O
replaced O
the O
awesome O
ergonomic O
small O
lightweight O
power B-AS
supply I-AS
with O
a O
power B-AS
supply I-AS
that O
weighed O
more O
than O
the O
machine O
itself O
. O

It O
's O
the O
inside O
that O
is O
truly O
wonderful O
. O

Enjoy O
that O
Toshib O
force B-AS
and O
durability B-AS
unparalleled O

I O
purchased O
this O
laptop O
9 O
months O
ago O
! O

Which O
is O
great O
I O
am O
running O
Vista B-AS
Business I-AS
and O
scored O
a O
5X O
on O
the O
index O
I O
have O
never O
seen O
a O
windows O
machine O
have O
a O
total O
score O
in O
the O
5 O
's O
. O

Returning O
this O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
get O
out O
of O
work O

I O
use O
the O
computer O
to O
basically O
check O
emails O
, O
surf B-AS
the I-AS
web I-AS
, O
print O
coupons O
and O
for O
my O
college O
papers O
. O

This O
unit O
is O
not O
. O

We O
love O
the O
size B-AS
of I-AS
the I-AS
screen I-AS
, O
although O
it O
is O
still O
lightweight O
and O
very O
easy O
to O
tote B-AS
around O
. O

They O
are O
n't O
worth O
the O
money O
, O
even O
though O
they O
are O
on O
the O
cheap O
side O
, O
laptop O
speaking O
. O

Either O
way O
the O
entire O
thing O
was O
just O
a O
joke O
, O
a O
complete O
rip O
off O
! O

so O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
computer O
does O
not O
work B-AS
on O
the O
24 O
twenty O
fourth O
day O
is O
my O
fault O
. O

So O
glad O
I O
decided O
to O
upgrade O
! O

I O
would O
definitely O
reccomend O
this O
if O
you O
are O
in O
the O
market O
for O
an O
easy O
to O
use B-AS
, O
stylish O
, O
fun O
, O
awesome O
computer O
. O

the O
battery B-AS
is O
irreplaceable O
. O

* O
IF O
YOU O
ARE O
LOOKING O
FOR O
A O
GOOD O
LAPTOP O
, O
THIS O
IS O
NOT O
IT O
! O

If O
you O
want O
a O
little O
more O
custom O
ability O
, O
drop O
a O
few O
bucks O
and O
upgrade O
to O
one O
of O
the O
more O
robust O
versions O
of O
Win B-AS
7 I-AS
and O
grab O
a O
2 B-AS
GB I-AS
stick I-AS
of I-AS
memory I-AS
to O
spice O
it O
all O
up O
a O
bit O
more O
. O

It O
's O
catatonic O
. O

I O
have O
never O
really O
been O
big O
on O
downloading O
anything O
so O
I O
was O
n't O
too O
worried O
about O
getting O
a O
virus O
, O
plus O
I O
thought O
I O
was O
protected O
by O
Norton B-AS
. O

The O
internet B-AS
was O
locekd O
and O
froze O
every O
time O
it O
was O
trying O
to O
be O
used O
, O
and O
the O
command B-AS
prompt I-AS
would O
not O
work O
at O
all O
. O

It O
's O
software B-AS
and O
speed B-AS
enable O
it O
to O
do O
amazing O
things O
. O

The O
Toshiba O
Satellite O
laptop O
is O
DESIGNED O
to O
fail O
! O

He O
came O
into O
my O
house O
, O
fiddled O
around O
on O
the O
computer O
for O
a O
good O
forty O
minutes O
and O
got O
ready O
to O
leave O
before O
it O
was O
even O
done O
doing O
what O
he O
was O
doing O
to O
it O
. O

My O
wireless O
provider O
confirmed O
my O
home O
internet O
is O
fine O
, O
and O
any O
connections O
I O
turn O
on O
should O
work O
. O

Could O
not O
keep O
up O
with O
me O
and O
finally O
the O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
went O
out O
. O

I O
could O
have O
purchased O
a O
cheap O
computer O
to O
do O
what O
I O
' O
m O
doing O
now O
! O

I O
am O
most O
impressed O
with O
the O
programming B-AS
, O
including O
the O
iPhoto B-AS
. O

Speakers B-AS
too O
small O
to O
be O
of O
any O
real O
use O
. O

I O
upgraded O
it O
's O
RAM B-AS
to O
2 O
GB O
, O
I O
am O
very O
happy O
with O
it O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
computer O
. O

I O
purchased O
a O
Toshiba O
Satellite O
M60 O
with O
harman O
/ O
kardon O
speakers B-AS
! O
in O
December O
of O
2005 O
. O

Dismantle O
the O
whole O
thing O
? O
Then O
it O
will O
not O
be O
a O
newly O
manufactured O
set O
like O
before O
. O

They O
should O
have O
included O
more O
memory B-AS
on O
their O
computers O
if O
they O
knew O
Vista B-AS
would O
run O
slowly O
. O

Battery B-AS
life I-AS
could O
be O
better O
but O
overall O
for O
the O
price B-AS
and O
Toshiba O
's O
reputation O
for O
laptops O
it O
's O
great O
! O

The O
battery B-AS
never O
held O
a O
charge B-AS
longer O
than O
one O
hour O
and O
within O
two O
months O
, O
stopped O
holding O
a O
charge B-AS
for O
more O
than O
ten O
minutes O
. O

It O
would O
n't O
fit O
in O
most O
17-inch O
bags O
. O

The O
first O
time O
it O
crashed O
was O
maybe O
going O
on O
a O
year O
and O
a O
half O
of O
having O
it O
. O

After O
the O
warrenty B-AS
expired O
the O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
went O
bad O
and O
it O
would O
have O
cost O
more O
to O
fix O
then O
to O
replace O
. O

I O
paid O
$ O
800 O
for O
this O
computer O
from O
my O
school O
campus O
bookstore O
. O

It O
is O
small O
enough O
to O
fit O
in O
one O
of O
my O
purses O
! O

The O
Windows B-AS
7 I-AS
Starter I-AS
is O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
a O
great O
way O
to O
think O
about O
using O
your O
netbook O
, O
basics O
, O
basics O
, O
basics O
. O

I O
was O
very O
worried O
about O
making O
the O
two O
compatible O
but O
literally O
, O
it O
was O
so O
simple O
I O
was O
almost O
worried O
that O
I O
was O
doing O
something O
wrong O
. O

Note O
that O
I O
do O
n't O
ordinarily O
take O
the O
time O
to O
write O
a O
review O
. O

The O
neat O
and O
organized O
icon B-AS
list I-AS
is O
a O
welcome O
change O
from O
cluttered O
and O
confusing O
desktop B-AS
icons I-AS
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
netbook O
after O
my O
original O
Toshiba O
laptop O
crashed O
right O
after O
the O
warranty B-AS
expired O
. O

Apparently O
well O
- O
ASPECT2 O
and O
gorgeous O
to O
look B-AS
at O
, O
the O
i5 O
MacBook O
Pro O
is O
a O
winning O
combination O
of O
price B-AS
and O
performance B-AS
. O

ASUS O
has O
done O
an O
outstanding O
job O
of O
evolving O
their O
netbooks O
, O
and O
I O
would O
recommend O
this O
to O
anyone O
who O
both O
understands O
their O
needs O
and O
how O
netbooks O
can O
fit O
them O
. O

The O
apple B-AS
care I-AS
has O
never O
failed O
me O
, O
and O
I O
expect O
it O
to O
be O
the O
same O
for O
this O
computer O
as O
well O
. O

Buyer O
Beware O
. O

It O
has O
served O
my O
needs O
quite O
nicely O
for O
the O
most O
part O
. O

The O
Toshiba O
laptop O
I O
am O
using O
is O
easier O
to O
use B-AS
than O
most O
I O
have O
tried O
. O

So O
I O
called O
Compaq O
, O
and O
after O
being O
on O
the O
phone O
for O
3 O
hours O
, O
i O
finally O
got O
a O
replacement O
which O
I O
should O
n't O
have O
had O
a O
problem O
getting O
since O
it O
was O
under O
warranty B-AS
. O

So O
we O
exchanged O
it O
for O
the O
same O
on O
and O
after O
2 O
hours O
it O
did O
n't O
work B-AS
. O

do O
not O
buy O
you O
will O
be O
disappointed O
. O

I O
just O
recently O
had O
to O
ship O
my O
laptop O
back O
to O
HP O
for O
repair O
. O

I O
have O
had O
to O
take O
it O
to O
the O
geek O
squad O
guys O
to O
get O
it O
fixed O
because O
it O
has O
had O
viruses O
3 O
times O
and O
i O
have O
not O
even O
had O
it O
for O
more O
then O
4 O
months O
! O

We O
do O
n't O
Mind O
and O
You O
do O
n't O
Matter O
. O

I O
love O
the O
size B-AS
, O
keyboard B-AS
, O
the O
functions B-AS
. O

But O
as O
time O
went O
on O
I O
found O
it O
almost O
impossible O
to O
keep O
the O
thing O
on O
- O
line O
through O
wi O
- O
fi O
. O

the O
mouse B-AS
is O
way O
way O
way O
to O
sensitve O
. O

Toshiba O
knows O
there O
is O
a O
manufacturing O
defect O
but O
will O
not O
acknowledge O
it O
. O

The O
OS B-AS
is O
still O
as O
fast O
as O
the O
day O
that O
the O
laptop O
was O
purchased O
and O
continues O
to O
run B-AS
flawlessly O
. O

Also O
, O
I O
issued O
a O
replacement O
RMA O
for O
a O
few O
dead O
pixels O
in O
the O
upper O
zone O
of O
the O
screen B-AS
, O
which O
is O
noticable O
to O
me O
. O

Waited O
on O
getting O
this O
computer O
, O
but O
it O
has O
been O
a O
great O
change O
. O

After O
way O
too O
many O
times O
sending O
the O
thing O
in O
for O
repairs O
delivery B-AS
service I-AS
was O
slow O
, O
and O
without O
the O
laptop O
I O
had O
no O
access O
to O
the O
internet O
, O
and O
thus O
no O
way O
of O
tracking O
it O
to O
find O
out O
when O
I O
might O
hope O
to O
see O
my O
computer O
again O
, O
it O
finally O
kicked O
the O
bucket O
after O
just O
over O
2 O
years O
. O

My O
friend O
reports O
the O
notebook O
is O
astonishing O
in O
performance B-AS
, O
picture B-AS
quality I-AS
, O
and O
ease O
of O
use B-AS
. O

the O
i3 B-AS
processor I-AS
does O
n't O
seem O
to O
run O
hot O
and O
the O
fan B-AS
rarely O
turns O
on O
. O

I O
was O
getting O
extrememly O
frustrated O
when O
I O
would O
want O
to O
do O
these O
simple O
taks O
that O
I O
would O
have O
to O
wait O
and O
wait O
and O
wait O
for O
things O
to O
download O
or O
virus O
that O
would O
clog O
up O
my O
PC O
. O

Enjoy O
your O
sitdown O

The O
battery B-AS
never O
held O
a O
charge B-AS
longer O
than O
one O
hour O
and O
within O
two O
months O
, O
stopped O
holding O
a O
charge B-AS
for O
more O
than O
ten O
minutes O
. O

Another O
THREE O
weeks O
later O
I O
had O
my O
laptop O
back O
with O
a O
new O
mousepad B-AS
, O
keys B-AS
, O
and O
casing B-AS
. O

I O
have O
had O
my O
new O
Macbook O
Pro O
i5 O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
days O
and O
have O
recycled O
ALL O
of O
my O
old O
PC O
laptops O
. O

See O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
laptops O
you O
buy O
it O
and O
get O
just O
a O
normal O
operating B-AS
system I-AS
with O
trials O
of O
must O
need O
stuff O
that O
should O
come O
with O
it O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
do O
n't O
understand O
is O
that O
the O
resolution B-AS
of I-AS
the I-AS
screen I-AS
is O
n't O
high O
enough O
for O
some O
pages O
, O
such O
as O
Yahoo O
! O
Mail O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
wish O
this O
had O
was O
the O
option O
to O
turn O
off O
the O
touchpad B-AS
with O
a O
button O
like O
my O
big O
16 O
laptop O
does O
. O

very O
convenient O
when O
you O
travel O
and O
the O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
is O
excellent O
. O

The O
machine O
is O
slow O
to O
boot B-AS
up I-AS
and O
occasionally O
crashes O
completely O
. O

This O
is O
great O
if O
you O
have O
several O
lectures O
back O
to O
back O
and O
do O
n't O
have O
a O
chance O
to O
charge B-AS
during O
one O
of O
the O
lectures O
. O

I O
wish O
Toshiba O
would O
allow O
their O
customers O
to O
select O
an O
option O
that O
only O
boots O
the O
OS B-AS
at O
setup O
and O
removes O
all O
the O
unnecessary O
stuff O
. O

At O
first O
it O
's O
like O
you O
're O
in O
that O
honeymoon O
stage O
with O
your O
laptop O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
buy O
a O
generic O
brand O
computer O
but O
it O
is O
really O
nice O
. O

i O
can O
use O
it O
for O
all O
of O
my O
needs O
. O

After O
doing O
CAD O
work O
all O
day O
at O
work O
, O
using O
a O
higher O
end O
PC O
, O
I O
could O
n't O
come O
home O
and O
settle O
for O
the O
use O
of O
a O
lower O
end O
computer O
. O

the O
screen B-AS
brightness I-AS
automatically O
adjusts O
. O

I O
especially O
like O
the O
backlit B-AS
keyboard I-AS
. O

Either O
way O
I O
' O
m O
furious O
. O

Besides O
the O
great O
look B-AS
, O
it O
is O
a O
great O
machine O
. O

My O
laptop O
cost B-AS
approximately O
$ O
2,300 O
and O
DIED O
after O
only O
2-years O
, O
10-months O
and O
18-days O
of O
use O
. O

The O
sound B-AS
is O
a O
bit O
quiet O
if O
you O
're O
on O
a O
plane O
, O
this O
can O
easily O
be O
overcome O
with O
a O
decent O
pair O
of O
head O
phones O
. O

I O
was O
not O
aware O
that O
this O
product O
can O
not O
display O
websites O
that O
contain O
Flash O
. O

This O
computer O
was O
bought O
because O
I O
wanted O
top O
of O
the O
line O
, O
fast O
, O
reliable O
, O
HA O
. O

A O
lot O
of O
help O
they O
WERE O
N'T O
! O

The O
SATA B-AS
controller I-AS
is O
the O
motherboard B-AS
chip I-AS
that O
lets O
the O
CPU B-AS
talk O
to O
the O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
. O

I O
will O
never O
buy O
anything O
from O
HP O
again O
! O

I O
ca O
n't O
imagine O
EVER O
buying O
a O
PC O
again O
! O

The O
buttons B-AS
you O
have O
to O
press O
a O
little O
harder O
than O
most O
. O

The O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
was O
supposed O
to O
be O
6 O
hours O
, O
but O
even O
if O
I O
ran O
off O
the O
battery B-AS
with O
the O
high O
effeciency O
setting O
the O
battery B-AS
would O
only O
last O
me O
on O
average O
about O
25 O
to O
3 O
hours O
. O

It O
allows O
you O
to O
automatically O
upload O
photos O
to O
your O
Facebook O
account O
with O
one O
click O
. O

Took O
it O
back O
as O
it O
was O
defective O
. O

Other O
Thoughts O
, O
I O
love O
newegg O
, O
I O
recommend O
them O
to O
the O
world O
however O
this O
is O
just O
unacceptable O
. O

Now O
17 O
months O
later O
they O
want O
would O
not O
say O
exact O
amount O
$ O
16500 O
to O
$ O
400 O
to O
fix O
the O
machine O
. O

I O
simply O
got O
tired O
of O
a O
bad O
computer O
like O
windows O
with O
its O
constant O
freezing O
and O
anti O
- O
virus O
. O

I O
am O
not O
one O
to O
throw O
things O
like O
this O
around O
but O
it O
is O
a O
laptop O
so O
carrying O
it O
around O
does O
seem O
to O
mean O
it O
will O
be O
jerked O
possibly O
a O
little O
, O
while O
driving O
a O
car O
and O
carrying O
it O
into O
where O
ever O
you O
are O
using O
it O
. O

Right O
size B-AS
and O
weight B-AS
for O
portability B-AS
. O

We O
decided O
we O
would O
try O
to O
trade O
- O
in O
our O
old O
ones O
. O

So O
far O
, O
so O
good O
! O

It O
took O
a O
little O
over O
2 O
weeks O
until O
i O
got O
it O
back O
. O

Eventually O
the O
screen O
went O
blank O
and O
the O
computer O
would O
not O
turn O
on O
. O

The O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
also O
does O
n't O
keep O
up O
with O
the O
claim O
but O
still O
I O
think O
macbook O
is O
much O
ahead O
from O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
pack O
. O

It O
was O
loaded O
with O
Windows B-AS
Vista I-AS
Home I-AS
Premium I-AS
-- O
delivered O
with O
only O
1 B-AS
GB I-AS
of I-AS
RAM I-AS
, O
and O
it O
was O
a O
* O
dog O
* O
. O

What O
a O
waste O
of O
time O
it O
was O
to O
run O
a O
Defrag O
on O
the O
PC O
! O

The O
reflectiveness O
of O
the O
display B-AS
is O
only O
a O
minor O
inconvenience O
if O
you O
work O
in O
a O
controlled O
- O
lighting O
environment O
like O
me O
I O
prefer O
it O
dark O
or O
if O
you O
can O
crank O
up O
the O
brightness B-AS
. O

My O
one O
complaint O
with O
this O
laptop O
is O
that O
I O
' O
ve O
noticed O
an O
electronic B-AS
fuzz I-AS
sound I-AS
coming O
out O
of O
the O
headphone B-AS
jack I-AS
when O
headphones O
are O
plugged O
in O
. O

This O
system O
is O
not O
worth O
the O
money O
or O
trouble O
trying O
to O
get O
it O
fix O
. O

UPDATE O
, O
Two O
years O
after O
buying O
this O
laptop O
, O
I O
am O
now O
the O
proud O
owner O
of O
a O
lemon O
. O

While O
it O
was O
highly O
rated O
, O
would O
I O
like O
it O
? O
I O
tried O
the O
keyboard B-AS
at O
the O
store O
, O
and O
it O
seemed O
ok O
. O

Treat O
yourself O
to O
a O
more O
expensive O
, O
long O
- O
lasting O
laptop O
of O
quality B-AS
like O
a O
Sony O
, O
Apple O
, O
or O
Toshiba O
. O

I O
love O
it O
, O
never O
had O
a O
computer O
I O
was O
so O
impressed O
with O
, O
and O
I O
' O
ve O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
laptops O
and O
desktops O
, O
this O
one O
is O
FAR O
AND O
ABOVE O
THE O
BEST O
ONE O
I O
EVER O
HAD O
BEFORE O
. O

We O
did O
not O
even O
have O
it O
a O
year O
. O

I O
have O
had O
to O
call O
with O
a O
few O
questions O
or O
issues O
and O
they O
have O
helped O
me O
for O
free O
, O
even O
without O
the O
warranty B-AS
. O

So O
you O
out O
of O
of O
notebook O
and O
money O
. O

Was O
searching O
online O
for O
a O
power B-AS
supply I-AS
when O
I O
found O
this O
site O
. O

But O
to O
be O
honest O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
use O
my O
computer O
for O
anything O
like O
graphics B-AS
editing I-AS
and O
complex B-AS
data I-AS
analysis I-AS
and O
gaming B-AS
. O

I O
would O
rather O
spend O
my O
money O
on O
a O
computer O
that O
costs B-AS
more O
then O
a O
Toshiba O
that O
is O
n't O
good O
at O
all O
. O

No O
problem O
with O
the O
ordering O
or O
shipping B-AS
by O
the O
way O
. O

And O
the O
ram B-AS
the O
thing O
that O
makes O
it O
faster O
comes O
sporting O
2 O
gigs O
for O
high O
performance B-AS
to O
handle O
more O
stuff O
at O
once O
and O
surf B-AS
the I-AS
web I-AS
a O
whole O
lot O
faster O
than O
before O
. O

The O
one O
thing O
I O
wish O
it O
had O
was O
a O
detailed O
hardcopy B-AS
manuel I-AS
. O

I O
edit O
and O
burn O
to O
DVD O
a O
lot O
of O
video O
, O
so O
I O
obviously O
could O
not O
live O
with O
a O
non O
- O
functioning O
drive B-AS
. O

Fast O
, O
great O
visual B-AS
! O

It O
's O
priced B-AS
very O
reasonable O
and O
works B-AS
very O
well O
right O
out O
of O
the O
box O
. O

You O
will O
need O
them O
if O
you O
want O
to O
reload O
the O
OS B-AS
I O
recommend O
doing O
if O
you O
can O
to O
start O
fresh O
and O
optimal O
. O

apple O
and O
quess O
what O
, O
you O
have O
to O
send O
the O
whole O
laptop O
in O
, O
too O
bad O
, O
so O
sad O

If O
you O
could O
stretch O
by O
a O
few O
100 O
dollars O
I O
highly O
recommend O
you O
should O
replace O
your O
Windows O
laptop O
with O
this O
one O
. O

might O
have O
to O
buy O
one O
for O
me O
now O
, O
since O
I O
use O
it O
all O
the O
time O
. O

while O
the O
keyboard B-AS
itself O
is O
alright O
, O
the O
plate B-AS
around O
it O
is O
cheap O
plastic O
and O
makes O
a O
hollow O
sound O
when O
using O
the O
mouse B-AS
command I-AS
buttons I-AS
. O

I O
purchased O
it O
this O
year O
when O
my O
old O
HP O
laptop O
finally O
died O
and O
I O
was O
looking O
for O
something O
smaller O
and O
lighter O
than O
a O
laptop O
to O
carry O
around O
for O
classes O
and O
traveling O
. O

I O
Have O
a O
friend O
who O
has O
the O
other O
model O
and O
we O
put O
them O
side O
by O
side O
with O
the O
same O
dvd O
in O
battle O
of O
the O
Smithsonian O
After O
on O
Hour O
mine O
was O
at O
53 O
% O
life O
left O
and O
his O
was O
at O
69 O

The O
latest O
is O
on O
my O
LG O
Netbook O

Purchased O
as O
a O
gift O
for O
a O
friend O
. O

I O
would O
not O
recommend O
the O
purchase O
of O
this O
modle O
of O
Toshiba O
Computer O
or O
any O
Toshiba O
product O
for O
that O
matter O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
never O
had O
problems O
with O
viruses O
. O

After O
they O
found O
no O
other O
way O
, O
they O
told O
me O
to O
courier O
it O
to O
themsince O
they O
do O
n't O
allow O
the O
use O
of O
the O
post O
office O
at O
my O
expense O
, O
and O
sent O
me O
a O
4 O
page O
list O
of O
very O
specific O
packaging O
instructions O
to O
follow O
or O
it O
would O
n't O
be O
covered O
. O

There O
are O
so O
many O
wonderful O
features B-AS
and O
benefits O
to O
the O
new O
MacBook O
! O

the O
mcbook O
pro O
notebook O
will O
make O
it O
easy O
for O
you O
to O
write O
and O
read O
your O
emails O
at O
blazing O
speeds B-AS
. O

The O
only O
thing O
i O
can O
say O
is O
that O
the O
touch B-AS
pad I-AS
does O
nt O
work O
like O
it O
should O
all O
the O
time O
. O

However O
, O
I O
love O
this O
particular O
Mac O
because O
its O
very O
fast O
, O
great O
size B-AS
, O
and O
has O
fantastic O
features B-AS
like O
the O
lighted B-AS
keyboard I-AS
and O
easy O
mouse B-AS
pad I-AS
. O

Battery B-AS
life I-AS
needs O
more O
life O
. O

For O
some O
odd O
reasons O
the O
computer O
does O
n't O
reconize O
the O
operation B-AS
system I-AS
. O

I O
had O
to O
wait O
3 O
weeks O
to O
get O
it O
back O
and O
it O
still O
is O
not O
working O
properly O
. O

I O
am O
going O
to O
go O
back O
and O
return O
at O
Store O
I O
bought O
from O
! O

The O
trackpad B-AS
was O
easy O
to O
learn O
and O
navigate O
. O

Applications B-AS
open O
in O
seconds O
and O
there O
are O
no O
lags O
, O
hiccups O
or O
awkward O
moments O
when O
you O
wonder O
whether O
your O
computer O
is O
out O
for O
tea O
. O

My O
husband O
purchased O
a O
laptop O
at O
the O
same O
time O
for O
about O
$ O
300 O
less O
he O
got O
a O
pc O
. O

I O
respond O
that O
I O
do O
not O
have O
the O
old O
computer O
and O
this O
way O
I O
would O
lose O
the O
data O
on O
my O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
. O

Again O
in O
February O
my O
computer O
completely O
failed O
to O
the O
point O
that O
it O
could O
not O
load O
Windows B-AS
so O
I O
contacted O
Acer O
to O
get O
it O
fixed O
thru O
my O
Warrenty B-AS
and O
it O
took O
about O
3 O
days O
fighting O
on O
the O
phone O
with O
agents B-AS
and O
it O
seemed O
as O
though O
NONE O
of O
them O
spoke O
English O
. O

I O
think O
this O
ps O
was O
manufactured O
in O
the O
mid O
90 O
's O
. O

both O
upgrades O
were O
quickly O
accomplished O
after O
purchasing O
the O
necessary O
Product O
Key O
. O

I O
have O
owned O
it O
only O
two O
months O
! O

I O
love O
my O
macbook O
pro O
! O

From O
the O
moment O
I O
opened O
the O
box O
to O
the O
present O
it O
has O
been O
a O
great O
joy O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
eMachines O
Notebook O
PC O
in O
January O
of O
this O
year O
and O
I O
am O
highly O
dissatisfied O
with O
it O
. O

Even O
though O
the O
computer O
is O
larger O
they O
did O
not O
make O
the O
keyboard B-AS
larger O
. O

Thanks O
, O
MacConnection O
, O
for O
making O
this O
a O
seamless O
purchase O
! O

We O
paid O
for O
the O
three B-AS
year I-AS
warranty I-AS
and O
the O
extended B-AS
warranty I-AS
after O
that O
one O
ended O
as O
well O
. O

Its O
not O
just O
slow O
on O
the O
internet B-AS
, O
its O
slow O
in O
general O
. O

It O
has O
just O
enough O
RAM B-AS
to O
run O
smoothly O
and O
enough O
memory B-AS
to O
satisfy O
my O
needs O
. O

The O
difference O
is O
phenomenal O
. O

I O
acually O
believe O
the O
issue O
is O
with O
the O
Nvidia B-AS
grafics I-AS
card I-AS
, O
but O
still O
requires O
a O
return O
. O

I O
am O
a O
freelance O
graphic O
artist O
. O

No O
waiting O
to O
have O
my O
claim O
reviewed O
by O
someone O
in O
another O
state O
or O
more O
often O
, O
another O
country O
. O

I O
did O
not O
like O
my O
acer O
. O

My O
husband O
got O
me O
this O
for O
Chrismas O
after O
getting O
me O
a O
very O
expensve O
laptop O
that O
did O
not O
work B-AS
after O
2 O
days O
. O

Problem O
fixed O
which O
is O
great O
but O
there O
went O
another O
two O
weeks O
without O
my O
laptop O
at O
school O
. O

The O
resolution B-AS
is O
even O
higher O
then O
any O
other O
laptop O
on O
the O
market O
. O

Then O
just O
the O
other O
day O
, O
my O
left B-AS
" I-AS
mouse I-AS
" I-AS
button I-AS
snapped O
! O

It O
is O
VERY O
easy O
to O
type B-AS
on O
and O
feels O
great O
, O
besides O
the O
added O
feature B-AS
that O
the O
keyboard B-AS
is O
lighted O
. O

Laptop O
is O
advertised O
as O
a O
15 B-AS
" I-AS
but O
the O
casing B-AS
looks O
like O
that O
of O
a O
17 B-AS
" I-AS
. O

Remember O
to O
do O
your O
research O
first O
before O
consider O
buying O
a O
toshiba O
product O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
laptop O
the O
moment O
unibody O
product O
came O
to O
the O
market O
. O

The O
only O
time O
I O
have O
restarted O
is O
during O
system O
updates O
. O

mac O
is O
extremely O
different O
than O
any O
other O
laptop O
. O

The O
feel B-AS
of O
this O
machine O
compared O
to O
the O
old O
MacBook O
is O
far O
superior O
. O

In O
due O
course O
, O
I O
'll O
remove O
the O
hard B-AS
disc I-AS
from O
this O
new O
MacBook O
Pro O
and O
dump O
it O
where O
it O
belongs O
, O
in O
the O
trash O
. O

It O
's O
great O
and O
we O
will O
always O
stick O
with O
Apple O
computers O
, O
we O
have O
been O
so O
happy O
with O
them O
. O

I O
should O
have O
realized O
that O
trouble O
was O
brewing O
. O

They O
break O
down O
just O
as O
often O
as O
PCs O
do O
, O
and O
the O
only O
reason O
they O
do O
n't O
get O
viruses O
, O
is O
because O
no O
one O
makes O
viruses O
for O
them O
, O
they O
're O
not O
better O
in O
any O
way O
, O
they O
are O
worse O
, O
try O
finding O
virus B-AS
protection I-AS
programs I-AS
for I-AS
a I-AS
Mac I-AS
, O
they O
do O
n't O
exist O
. O

Thank O
you O
. O

The O
benefits O
were O
immediate O
! O

Much O
faster O
than O
my O
old O
windows O
laptop O
that O
died O
on O
me O
. O

Never O
any O
doubt O
I O
would O
get O
a O
MacBook O
, O
just O
was O
n't O
sure O
which O
one O
. O

But O
with O
A O
WAY O
Bigger O
Screen B-AS
, O
and O
IS O
able O
to O
connect O
to O
an O
HDMI B-AS
. O

the O
graphics B-AS
are O
awful O
and O
the O
wireless B-AS
switch I-AS
it O
at O
the O
top O
rather O
than O
the O
side O
which O
I O
am O
used O
to O
it O
being O
on O
the O
side O
. O

The O
overall O
build B-AS
quality I-AS
of O
the O
unit O
is O
excellent O
and O
she O
'd O
recommend O
it O
to O
anyone O
else O
looking O
for O
a O
netbook O
. O

I O
bought O
my O
Acer O
Aspire O
custom O
made O
in O
June O
2008 O
. O

I O
guess O
he O
was O
the O
technical B-AS
person I-AS
. O

They O
click O
. O

A O
seventy O
dollar O
mouse B-AS
! O

The O
repairs O
were O
made O
quickly O
though O
I O
must O
say O
, O
however O
the O
second O
time O
they O
shipped B-AS
it O
to O
the O
incorrect O
address O
and O
it O
took O
nearly O
a O
week O
for O
them O
to O
get O
it O
to O
me O
. O

I O
have O
the O
A65 O
, O
right O
now O
it O
's O
a O
paperweight O
. O

when O
i O
first O
got O
it O
i O
thought O
the O
size B-AS
of O
it O
was O
a O
joke O
. O

That O
being O
said O
, O
it O
still O
runs O
video O
in O
full O
screen O
decently O
. O

It O
is O
fast O
and O
i O
have O
not O
had O
a O
problem O
with O
internet B-AS
connection I-AS
or O
any O
other O
problems O
. O

I O
' O
m O
really O
impressed O
with O
the O
quality B-AS
and O
performance B-AS
for O
the O
price B-AS
of O
the O
computer O
. O

But O
when O
I O
received O
my O
replacement O
, O
I O
made O
BOTH O
recovery B-AS
DVDs I-AS
4 O
, O
and O
a O
driver B-AS
/ I-AS
application I-AS
DVD I-AS
. O

In O
addition O
, O
there O
is O
photo B-AS
detection I-AS
software I-AS
that O
will O
allow O
you O
to O
group O
all O
the O
photos O
together O
based O
upon O
the O
people O
in O
the O
picture O
. O

The O
speakers B-AS
are O
terrible O
and O
are O
probably O
the O
cheapest O
ones O
I O
have O
ever O
seen O
in O
a O
laptop O
so O
if O
your O
planning O
to O
listen O
to O
music O
I O
suggest O
you O
get O
something O
better O
. O

So O
then O
you O
may O
be O
lucky O
to O
get O
ahold O
to O
someone O
who O
understands O
that O
its O
no O
good O
and O
they O
will O
let O
you O
send O
it O
back O
, O
but O
of O
course O
you O
are O
taking O
a O
chance O
of O
them O
testing O
it O
out O
to O
see O
what O
has O
happened O
, O
and O
they O
tell O
you O
that O
it O
was O
not O
on O
their O
side O
, O
then O
you O
are O
stuck O
paying O
for O
the O
repair O
the O
price B-AS
of O
a O
new O
one O
. O

What O
's O
really O
great O
about O
this O
product O
is O
you O
may O
have O
a O
family O
member O
who O
is O
computer O
illiterate O
and O
you O
can O
pretty O
much O
just O
let O
them O
loose O
on O
this O
computer O
without O
any O
real O
supervision O
. O

The O
lesson O
learned O
here O
is O
, O
It O
does O
not O
pay O
to O
by O
this O
loyal O
to O
any O
brand O
, O
since O
all O
of O
them O
are O
there O
to O
simply O
to O
make O
as O
much O
money O
as O
possible O
, O
as O
fast O
as O
they O
can O
, O
and O
in O
this O
day O
and O
age O
, O
the O
customer O
no O
longer O
is O
right O
all O
the O
times O
. O

PDF O
files O
can O
be O
viewed O
instantly O
. O

Dell O
Latitude O
d620 O
is O
not O
a O
reliable O
machine O
. O

I O
have O
had O
it O
for O
almost O
four O
years O
now O
and O
I O
have O
only O
had O
a O
few O
problems O
with O
it O
. O

Overall O
for O
the O
money O
this O
is O
a O
good O
deal O
. O

It O
is O
so O
simple O
to O
use B-AS
, O
I O
use B-AS
it O
more O
than O
my O
desktop O
. O

I O
also O
had O
a O
problem O
with O
the O
touchpad B-AS
that O
caused O
the O
mouse B-AS
pointer I-AS
to O
jump O
all O
over O
the O
screen B-AS
. O

I O
saved O
for O
this O
laptop O
for O
3 O
months O
and O
I O
can O
tell O
you O
personally O
it O
was O
worth O
the O
wait O
. O

I O
own O
a O
Hewlett O
Packard O
laptop O
and O
I O
' O
ve O
had O
man O
problems O
with O
it O
since O
I O
bought O
in O
in O
Feb O
, O
201 O

It O
has O
a O
overheating O
issue O
, O
nearly O
to O
the O
point O
of O
being O
dangerous O
. O

I O
have O
had O
no O
problems O
with O
it O
unlike O
some O
hardware B-AS
defects O
on O
past O
models O
. O

EITHER O
WAY O
, O
THE O
KEYBOARD B-AS
IS O
UNSATISFACTORY O
. O

Well O
, O
I O
have O
to O
say O
since O
I O
bought O
my O
Mac O
, O
I O
wo O
n't O
ever O
go O
back O
to O
any O
Windows B-AS
. O

I O
took O
it O
in O
to O
the O
Apple O
store O
and O
guess O
what O
? O
They O
fixed O
it O
, O
no O
cost B-AS
out O
of O
pocket O
. O

I O
have O
used O
different O
laptops O
in O
the O
past O
and O
I O
have O
to O
rate O
this O
one O
way O
above O
the O
rest O
. O

I O
love O
the O
Mac O
so O
much O
better O
than O
my O
work O
PC O
! O

The O
quality B-AS
, O
engineering B-AS
design I-AS
and O
warranty B-AS
are O
superior O
-- O
covers O
damage O
from O
dropping O
the O
laptop O
. O

I O
recommend O
the O
Macbook O
Pro O
if O
you O
want O
the O
best O
laptop O
on O
the O
market O
. O

The O
applications B-AS
are O
also O
very O
easy O
to O
find O
and O
maneuver O
, O
much O
easier O
than O
any O
other O
computer O
I O
have O
ever O
owned O
. O

The O
large O
screen B-AS
gives O
you O
the O
option O
to O
comfortably O
watch O
movies O
or O
TV O
shows O
on O
your O
computer O
instead O
of O
buying O
an O
additional O
TV O
for O
your O
dorm O
room O
. O

Small O
and O
light O
weight O
. O

Great O
laptop O
for O
school O
, O
easy O
to O
use B-AS
for O
beginners O
in O
the O
hoASPECT0hold O
. O

He O
did O
n't O
work O
for O
sony O
, O
he O
was O
just O
approved O
to O
fix O
their O
crappy O
products O
. O

4 O
Laptop O
still O
did O
not O
work B-AS
, O
blue O
screen O
within O
a O
week O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
is O
n't O
perfect O
about O
this O
netbook O
is O
the O
speakers B-AS
, O
they O
are O
not O
loud O
at O
all O
but O
I O
expected O
that O
. O

Bought O
for O
my O
daughter O
to O
take O
for O
starting O
college O
this O
fall O
, O
she O
has O
been O
on O
it O
non O
- O
stop O
ever O
since O
learning O
how O
to O
use O
it O
. O

Never O
had O
a O
single O
problem O
, O
and O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
viruses O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
I O
inspected O
the O
other O
netbooks O
and O
clearly O
their O
hinges B-AS
are O
tighter O
and O
I O
even O
demonstrate O
the O
difference O
between O
my O
netbook O
and O
others O
. O

Not O
to O
mention O
the O
fact O
that O
your O
mac O
comes O
fully O
loaded O
with O
all O
necessary O
basic O
programs B-AS
. O

Did O
n't O
work B-AS
when O
shipped O
from O
Walmartcom O
but O
went O
into O
a O
store O
and O
exchanged O
for O
a O
work B-AS
laptop O
same O
make O
/ O
model O
. O

It O
is O
SO O
much O
fun O
to O
play O
with O
. O

If O
this O
is O
an O
improvement O
in O
Customer B-AS
Service I-AS
then O
I O
would O
hate O
too O
see O
what O
it O
was O
before O
! O

* O
6th O
week*-They O
are O
not O
responding O
to O
my O
emails O
asking O
when O
they O
expect O
to O
dispatch O
the O
new O
unit O
. O

All O
of O
the O
programs B-AS
Keynote I-AS
, O
Pages B-AS
, O
Numbers B-AS
have O
an O
option O
to O
save O
your O
documents O
as O
Microsoft O
compatible O
, O
which O
really O
eliminates O
the O
need O
for O
the O
actual O
. O

Sure O
, O
the O
initial O
out O
of O
pocket O
expense B-AS
is O
greater O
, O
but O
that O
should O
not O
dissuade O
anyone O
from O
the O
fact O
that O
these O
machines O
run B-AS
like O
none O
other O
on O
the O
planet O
, O
and O
when O
I O
factor O
in O
all O
the O
money O
in O
that O
I O
wasted O
on O
Geek O
Squad O
and O
the O
latest O
patches O
to O
de O
- O
corrupt O
my O
infested O
PCs O
, O
it O
probably O
comes O
out O
about O
even O
anyhow O
. O

The O
best O
thing O
to O
do O
is O
build O
your O
own O
computer O
, O
but O
if O
u O
ca O
n't O
company O
's O
like O
dell O
who O
allow O
you O
to O
choose O
the O
components B-AS
are O
better O
and O
for O
the O
same O
price B-AS
you O
can O
get O
a O
computer O
who O
compares O
to O
one O
of O
apple O
$ O
2000 O
systems O
and O
if O
you O
google O
dell O
coupons O
you O
can O
find O
codes O
that O
take O
a O
signifant O
amount O
off O
the O
price B-AS
. O

There O
is O
no O
cd B-AS
drive I-AS
on O
the O
computer O
, O
which O
defeats O
the O
purpose O
of O
keeping O
files O
on O
a O
cd O
. O

And O
Toshiba O
is O
a O
quality O
supplier O
. O

For O
me O
I O
was O
lucky O
and O
a O
local O
store O
was O
selling O
them O
for O
$ O
2000 O
off O
and O
Best O
Buy O
matched O
their O
price B-AS
so O
I O
was O
able O
to O
buy O
one O
for O
under O
$ O
1000 O

I O
ca O
n't O
honestly O
say O
I O
was O
heartbroken O
. O

WILL O
NOT O
EVERY O
BUY O
ANOTHER O
-- O
-- O
-- O
-- O
LOU O

Unfortunately O
, O
Apple O
's O
quality B-AS
has O
continued O
to O
slide O
. O

and O
finally O
i O
realized O
that O
mac O
is O
the O
best O
. O

It O
's O
very O
annoying O
. O

I O
' O
m O
hoping O
that O
I O
can O
find O
a O
really O
quick O
way O
to O
clean O
it O
without O
it O
getting O
too O
gross O
. O

My O
only O
other O
complaint O
is O
that O
it O
gets O
really O
hot O
. O

I O
believe O
that O
the O
quality B-AS
of O
a O
mac O
is O
worth O
the O
price B-AS
. O

I O
' O
m O
Very O
disappointed O
in O
Dell O
. O

sometimes O
you O
will O
be O
moving O
your O
finger O
and O
the O
pointer B-AS
will O
not O
even O
move O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
only O
had O
mine O
a O
day O
but O
I O
' O
m O
already O
used O
to O
it O
. O

And O
that O
was O
the O
fourth O
time O
i O
ve O
sent O
it O
to O
them O
to O
get O
fixed O
. O

The O
13 O
Macbook O
Pro O
just O
fits O
in O
my O
budget B-AS
and O
with O
free O
shipping B-AS
and O
no O
tax O
to O
CA O
this O
is O
the O
best O
price B-AS
we O
can O
get O
for O
a O
great O
product O
. O

I O
would O
rate O
this O
computer O
at O
5 O
stars O
, O
but O
considering O
it O
has O
a O
short O
life B-AS
span I-AS
I O
can O
only O
give O
it O
1 O
and O
implore O
anyone O
looking O
at O
laptops O
to O
stay O
away O
from O
this O
machine O
. O

I O
also O
love O
the O
design B-AS
, O
the O
looks B-AS
, O
the O
feel B-AS
, O
and O
the O
my B-AS
toshiba I-AS
feature I-AS
is O
wonderfull O
. O

For O
me O
, O
five O
stars O
is O
not O
enough O
. O

I O
love O
how O
easy O
every O
thing O
is O
to O
do O
on O
my O
Apple O
products O
. O

Sadly O
Apple O
has O
discontinued O
this O
MacBook O
, O
I O
think O
it O
was O
never O
super O
popular O
since O
it O
fell O
somewhere O
in O
between O
the O
cheapest O
white O
model O
and O
the O
smaller O
Pros O
. O

The O
layout B-AS
of O
the O
MacBook O
is O
horrible O
and O
confusing O
; O

Was O
not O
happy O
with O
one B-AS
of I-AS
the I-AS
programs I-AS
on O
it O
. O

Also O
it O
is O
very O
good O
for O
college O
students O
who O
just O
need O
a O
reliable O
, O
easy O
to O
use B-AS
computer O
. O

The O
first O
one O
sent O
, O
Touchpad B-AS
did O
n't O
work O
The O
second O
sent O
, O
USB B-AS
did O
n't O
work O
The O
third O
sent O
, O
Touchpad B-AS
did O
n't O
work O
The O
fourth O
sent O
, O
Has O
n't O
arrived O
yet O
. O

I O
came O
from O
the O
Dell O
Laptops O
and O
now O
I O
am O
so O
glad O
I O
switched O
when O
I O
needed O
a O
new O
laptop O
. O

This O
is O
definitely O
a O
computer O
worth O
the O
money O
; O

Only O
other O
thing O
is O
that O
if O
you O
are O
using O
this O
for O
document B-AS
creation I-AS
Apple O
does O
nt O
provide O
any O
kind O
of O
word B-AS
processor I-AS
such O
as O
works O
for O
windows B-AS
, O
but O
iwork B-AS
is O
cheap O
compared O
to O
office B-AS
. O

I O
am O
stuck O
with O
a O
laptop O
that O
I O
can O
not O
do O
very O
much O
with O
. O

It O
is O
light O
and O
the O
battery B-AS
last O
a O
very O
long O
time O
. O

Better O
stick O
with O
another O
brand O
. O

I O
am O
glad O
I O
did O
my O
research O
. O

And O
at O
one O
point O
, O
they O
blame O
me O
for O
installing O
a O
bad O
memory B-AS
stick O
when O
I O
upgrade O
my O
memory B-AS
for O
the O
first O
time O
during O
my O
purchase O
of O
the O
laptop O
I O
bought O
the O
memory B-AS
stick O
they O
recomended O
. O

5 O
months O
dead O
again O
. O

Also O
, O
you O
wo O
n't O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
them O
going O
onlne O
a O
getting O
a O
virus O
. O

Very O
happy O
. O

The O
netbook O
is O
easier O
for O
me O
to O
take O
to O
bed O
and O
carry O
around O
with O
me O
. O

Externally O
the O
keys B-AS
on O
my O
keyboard B-AS
are O
falling O
off O
, O
after O
a O
few O
uses O
the O
paint B-AS
is O
rubbing O
off O
the O
button B-AS
below I-AS
the I-AS
mouse I-AS
pad I-AS
and O
where O
the O
heals O
of O
my O
hands O
sit O
, O
and O
the O
screen B-AS
has O
a O
terrible O
glare O
. O

My O
children O
wo O
n't O
even O
use O
it O
for O
their O
school O
work O
. O

THIS O
LAPTOP O
WAS O
BAD O
FROM O
THE O
FIRST O
DAY O
OF O
USE O
-- O
-- O
BROUGHT O
IT O
BACK O
TO O
STORE O
FOR O
RETURN O
OF O
MONEY O
. O

The O
next O
time O
I O
had O
an O
issue O
my O
lightscribe B-AS
would O
n't O
work O
. O

The O
touchpad B-AS
is O
extremely O
sensitive O
, O
which O
is O
the O
only O
drawback O
. O

also O
it O
comes O
with O
very O
useful O
applications B-AS
like O
iphoto B-AS
that O
it O
is O
the O
best O
photo B-AS
application I-AS
i O
have O
ever O
had O

It O
has O
everything O
I O
would O
need O
for O
a O
home O
computer O
. O

The O
computer O
did O
what O
it O
was O
NOT O
supposed O
to O
do O
, O
and O
I O
did O
n't O
know O
what O
to O
do O
. O

I O
love O
this O
computer O
. O

They O
informed O
me O
that O
I O
had O
around O
7 O
policies O
or O
viruses O
on O
it O
. O

They O
don O
t O
translate O
from O
a O
Mac O
, O
even O
on O
Word B-AS
, O
resulting O
in O
a O
ton O
of O
run O
- O
on O
sentences O
. O

The O
acer O
one O
computer O
that O
I O
bought O
is O
17 B-AS
ince I-AS
screen I-AS
and O
its O
hard O
to O
find O
lap O
top O
bags O
for O
it O
, O
but O
I O
like O
the O
big O
screen B-AS
on O
it O
. O

Summary O
, O
They O
played O
games O
with O
me O
for O
the O
warranty B-AS
period I-AS
. O

i O
ca O
n't O
believe O
HP O
put O
this O
out O
. O

In O
November O
my O
computer O
messed O
up O
entirely O
and O
would O
n't O
power O
on O
after O
intalling O
a O
Windows B-AS
update I-AS
, O
I O
had O
to O
have O
my O
HD B-AS
flashed O
and O
lost O
EVERYTHING O
on O
it O
, O
including O
my O
school O
assignments O
and O
irriplaceable O
pictures O
that O
were O
only O
in O
digital O
format O
and O
several O
other O
things O
, O
when O
this O
update O
was O
installed O
for O
some O
reason O
I O
was O
unable O
to O
roll O
back O
the O
drivers B-AS
and O
everything O
to O
an O
earlier O
working O
condition O
because O
when O
the O
update O
was O
installed O
it O
deleted O
my O
history O
. O

without O
a O
big O
ol O
clunky O
machine O
in O
my O
backpack O
, O
I O
feel O
like O
I O
can O
do O
programming O
homework O
anywhere O
. O

I O
can O
have O
both O
OSX B-AS
and O
Windows B-AS
XP I-AS
running O
at O
the O
same O
time O
! O

I O
tell O
everyone O
that O
I O
know O
, O
friends O
, O
family O
and O
enemies O
this O
is O
the O
absolute O
worst O
computer O
i O
have O
ever O
used O
. O

Overall O

Otherwise O
, O
I O
love O
it O
! O

Having O
someone O
give O
you O
a O
quick O
tour O
of O
how O
to O
's O
is O
the O
best O
. O

I O
have O
recently O
converted O
back O
to O
a O
mac O
and O
I O
could O
n't O
be O
happier O
! O

Microsoft O
seems O
to O
be O
unable O
to O
keep O
up O
with O
repairs O
for O
the O
multitude O
of O
windows B-AS
problems O
. O

At O
16 O
months O
it O
started O
shutting O
off O
after O
only O
5 O
or O
10 O
minutes O
. O

They O
basically O
told O
me O
that O
the O
machine O
would O
be O
problem O
free O
now O
. O

I O
paid O
about O
18000 O
for O
this O
laptop O
because O
of O
all O
the O
bells O
and O
whistles O
and O
it O
kept O
crapping O
out O
on O
me O
. O

The O
graphics B-AS
are O
stunning O
. O

I O
found O
a O
2 O
GB O
stick O
for O
a O
bit O
under O
$ O
50 O
Nice O
and O
portable O
and O
definitely O
a O
decent O
enough O
system B-AS
to O
keep O
you O
entertained O
while O
sitting O
in O
the O
airplane O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
hours O
, O
or O
at O
the O
hotel O
taking O
care O
of O
some O
last O
minute O
details O
and O
documents O
. O

after O
much O
effort O
and O
10 O
days O
ASUS O
replaced O
itThe O
WiFi B-AS
is O
very O
weak O
. O

You O
can O
call O
HP O
and O
they O
want O
you O
to O
buy O
more O
software B-AS
to O
fix O
it O
. O

It O
has O
been O
plagued O
with O
problems O
since O
the O
day O
i O
turned O
it O
on O
. O

this O
computer O
is O
a O
little O
more O
expensive O
than O
any O
pc O
but O
it O
will O
last O
you O
longer O
and O
it O
worth O
every O
penny O
. O

It O
is O
easy O
to O
navigate B-AS
and O
update B-AS
programs I-AS
. O

The O
laptop O
is O
gorgeous O
. O

It O
's O
more O
expensive O
but O
well O
worth O
it O
in O
the O
long O
run O
. O

I O
' O
m O
making O
the O
switch O
and O
finding O
that O
my O
biggest O
problem O
is O
trying O
to O
do O
things O
the O
old O
way O
, O
and O
Apple O
does O
, O
indeed O
, O
have O
the O
better O
idea O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
had O
hp O
desktop O
for O
over O
4 O
yrs O
now O
and O
not O
one O
days O
goes O
by O
that O
i O
do O
n't O
regret O
buying O
it O
. O

HP O
did O
n't O
fix O
it O
. O

Applications B-AS
respond O
immediately O
not O
like O
the O
tired O
MS B-AS
applications I-AS
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
a O
very O
disappointing O
experience O
except O
that O
I O
learned O
how O
good O
the O
Geek O
Squad O
is O
and O
also O
Customer B-AS
Service I-AS
. O

Now O
, O
I O
guess O
, O
I O
'll O
have O
to O
unload O
my O
M6809 O
on O
some O
poor O
, O
hapless O
soul O
. O

The O
only O
drawback O
for O
me O
is O
how O
dirty O
the O
screen B-AS
gets O
, O
and O
rather O
quickly O
too O
. O

The O
laptop O
is O
very O
lightASPECT1 O
, O
can O
easily O
carry B-AS
around O
in O
a O
knapsack O
full O
of O
text O
books O
and O
it O
barely O
adds O
any O
weight B-AS
. O

Seems O
to O
slow O
down O
occassionally O
but O
can O
run O
many O
applications B-AS
ie O
Internet B-AS
tabs I-AS
, O
programs B-AS
, O
etc O
simultaneously O
. O

The O
problems O
started O
with O
just O
the O
screen O
freezing O
. O

Taking O
it O
anywhere O
was O
a O
pain O
! O

I O
also O
did O
not O
like O
the O
loud O
noises B-AS
it O
made O
or O
how O
the O
bottom B-AS
of I-AS
the I-AS
computer I-AS
would O
get O
really O
hot O
. O

I O
had O
in O
the O
past O
a O
Dell O
laptop O
and O
they O
sent O
me O
the O
items O
it O
needed O
or O
they O
sent O
a O
repair B-AS
technician I-AS
to O
my O
house O
to O
fix O
it O
. O

I O
previously O
owned O
a O
Toshiba O
and O
it O
only O
lasted O
about O
2 O
years O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
imagine O
my O
life O
without O
it O
anymore O
! O

defective O
software B-AS
. O

This O
computer O
was O
so O
challenging O
to O
carry B-AS
and O
handle B-AS
. O

Cords B-AS
coming O
out O
the O
right O
for O
power B-AS
plus O
cords B-AS
coming O
out O
front O
for O
headphones B-AS
plus O
network B-AS
connection I-AS
on O
left O
make O
for O
a O
very O
messy O
setup B-AS
with O
cords B-AS
going O
every O
direction O
. O

Unless O
you O
want O
to O
be O
inconvenienced O
with O
a O
non O
working O
power B-AS
supply I-AS
which O
you O
ca O
n't O
find O
a O
replacement O
for O
because O
they O
made O
the O
attachment O
so O
small O
. O

It O
is O
much O
faster O
than O
my O
desktop O
which O
is O
a O
Core2 B-AS
Quad I-AS
running O
at O
283 O
GHz O
. O

It O
is O
good O
to O
know O
that O
I O
can O
mobilize O
without O
having O
to O
worry O
about O
the O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
. O

I O
baby O
my O
electronics O
so O
I O
know O
for O
a O
fact O
it O
was O
defective O
and O
not O
anything O
that O
I O
did O
to O
it O
. O

The O
screen B-AS
is O
nice O
, O
side O
view O
angles O
are O
pretty O
good O
. O

The O
fact O
that O
the O
screen B-AS
reacts O
to O
the O
lighting O
around O
you O
is O
an O
added O
luxury O
- O
when O
you O
are O
working O
around O
others O
in O
dark O
areas O
and O
want O
privacy O
or O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
bother O
them O
with O
bright O
lighting O
, O
it O
is O
very O
convenient O
to O
have O
a O
darker O
, O
softer O
lit O
screen B-AS
. O

3 O
weeks O
went O
by O
and O
the O
computer O
keeps O
crashing O
and O
will O
not O
open O
any O
applications B-AS
. O

Not O
to O
mention O
sometimes O
the O
whole O
charger B-AS
unit I-AS
will O
decide O
not O
to O
work O
entirely O
. O

Looks B-AS
nice O
, O
but O
has O
a O
horribly O
cheap O
feel B-AS
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
not O
buying O
this O
product O
. O

its O
more O
like O
a O
snail O
crawl O
. O

I O
have O
other O
computers O
that O
get O
strong O
signals B-AS
that O
do O
n't O
drop O
in O
places O
that O
this O
netbook O
loses O
its O
signal B-AS
. O

The O
feel B-AS
of O
this O
is O
better O
than O
the O
Toshiba O
, O
too O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
this O
laptop O
to O
anyone O
looking O
to O
get O
a O
new O
laptop O
who O
is O
willing O
to O
spend O
a O
little O
more O
money O
to O
get O
great O
quality B-AS
! O

I O
upgraded O
the O
memory B-AS
and O
replaced O
the O
base O
Windows B-AS
7 I-AS
Starter I-AS
to O
Win B-AS
7 I-AS
Home I-AS
, O
and O
it O
runs B-AS
just O
fine O
. O

I O
am O
not O
sure O
if O
it O
was O
the O
drive B-AS
itself O
, O
however O
; O

So O
I O
called O
, O
AGAIN O
. O

Also O
, O
one O
of O
the O
users O
mentioned O
how O
the O
edges B-AS
on O
the O
macbook O
is O
sharp O
, O
if O
you O
have O
money O
to O
spend O
on O
one O
of O
the O
incase B-AS
shells I-AS
, O
it O
does O
n't O
seem O
to O
be O
a O
problem O
. O

It O
is O
easy O
to O
use B-AS
, O
its O
keyboard B-AS
easily O
accommodates O
large O
hands O
, O
and O
its O
weight B-AS
is O
fantasic O
. O

Called O
Acer O
many O
times O
, O
they O
want O
me O
to O
pay O
the O
shipping B-AS
to O
ship O
it O
to O
their O
repair B-AS
center I-AS
, O
I O
was O
very O
disappointed O
since O
it O
is O
a O
brand O
new O
computer O
! O

I O
was O
constantly O
having O
to O
roll O
back O
the O
computer O
after O
doing O
updates O
. O

Stay O
away O
from O
Envy O
. O

-got O
it O
back O
3 O
months O
later O

I O
have O
had O
to O
send O
in O
my O
laptop O
three O
times O
to O
get O
it O
fixed O
. O

When O
I O
turned O
it O
on O
, O
nothing O
. O

I O
should O
have O
checked O
this O
before O
I O
installed O
my O
applications B-AS
. O

The O
battery B-AS
is O
really O
long O
. O

Anyway O
, O
in O
early O
July O
of O
this O
year O
, O
the O
DVD B-AS
burner I-AS
stopped O
working O
, O
and O
the O
computer O
stared O
having O
issues O
with O
power B-AS
supply I-AS
. O

Had O
some O
trouble O
finding O
a O
case B-AS
that O
it O
would O
fit O
in O
. O

The O
17 O
in O
Macbook O
Pro O
has O
been O
a O
wonderful O
addition O
. O

This O
computer O
that O
I O
have O
has O
had O
issues O
with O
the O
keyboard B-AS
where O
it O
lost O
half O
the O
keyboard B-AS
functions O
. O

1st O
time O
they O
got O
it O
working O
the O
next O
5 O
month O
they O
had O
me O
send O
it O
in O
. O

Comes O
with O

I O
just O
love O
my O
Mac O
! O

I O
can O
not O
even O
read O
what O
I O
am O
writing O
half O
of O
the O
time O

My O

after O
only O
16 O
months O
. O

They O
freeze O
all O
the O

. O

this O
one O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
might O
be O
a O
lemon O

The O

is O
useless O

COMPUTER O
HAS O
BEEN O
AT O
SERVICE B-AS
FACILITY I-AS
MORE O
THAN O
IN O
MY O
HANDS O
. O

This O
laptop O
is O
very O
large O
and O
barely O
fits O
in O
any O
carrying O
cases O
. O

When O
I O
called O
Sony O
the O
Customer B-AS
Service I-AS
was O
Great O
. O

even O
though O
I O
had O
the O
receipt O
in O
front O
of O
me O
proving O
it O
still O
had O
2 O
months O
left O
on O
the O
warranty B-AS
. O

I O
sent O
it O
to O
them O
to O
fix O
in O
perfect O
condition O
but O
for O
what O
was O
wrong O
with O
it O
. O

It O
is O
a O
much O
more O
streamlined O
system B-AS
for O
adding O
programs B-AS
, O
using B-AS
the I-AS
internet I-AS
, O
and O
doing O
other O
things O
everyone O
does O
on O
a O
computer O
. O

My O
computer O
froze O
on O
several O
occasion O
, O
had O
buttons B-AS
that O
randomely O
would O
fall O
off O
and O
even O
had O
moments O
when O
the O
computer O
would O
refuse O
to O
turn O
on O
at O
all O
. O

Not O
even O
safe B-AS
mode I-AS
boots O
. O

Which O
was O
way O
too O
much O
money O
. O

To O
those O
thinking O
about O
switching O
, O
do O
it O
and O
do O
not O
look O
back O
! O

This O
is O
an O
over O
- O
sized O
, O
18-inch B-AS
laptop O
. O

I O
had O
to O
pay O
$ O
100 O
for O
a O
universal B-AS
charger I-AS
for O
this O
cheap O
$ O
300 O
laptop O
. O

The O
powerpoint B-AS
opened O
seamlessly O
in O
the O
apple O
and O
the O
mac O
hooked O
up O
to O
the O
projector O
so O
easily O
it O
was O
almost O
scary O
. O

1You O
can O
not O
change O
your O
desktop B-AS
background I-AS
window I-AS
's I-AS
7 I-AS
starter I-AS
does O
NOT O
support O
that O
function B-AS
. O

Took O
me O
11 O
hours O
, O
3 O
trips O
to O
different O
FedEx O
offices O
, O
and O
brutal O
conversations O
with O
14 O
of O
the O
worse O
IT B-AS
support I-AS
technicians I-AS
in O
the O
world O
. O

Then O
after O
4 O
or O
so O
months O
the O
charger B-AS
stopped O
working O
so O
I O
was O
forced O
to O
go O
out O
and O
buy O
new O
hardware B-AS
just O
to O
keep O
this O
computer O
running O
. O

One O
year O
of O
trying O
to O
fix O
the O
computer O
by O
myself O
, O
with O
help O
of O
friends O
, O
and O
even O
help O
from O
computer O
experts O
I O
have O
given O
up O
on O
trying O
to O
fix O
it O
. O

As O
usual O
at O
customer B-AS
service I-AS
center I-AS
, O
she O
asked O
me O
to O
hold O
for O
a O
moment O
while O
she O
went O
to O
the O
back O
- O
office O
and O
compare O
it O
with O
other O
same O
model O
netbooks O
and O
discussed O
it O
with O
her O
colleague O
I O
could O
see O
them O
. O

The O
screen B-AS
gets O
smeary O
and O
dusty O
very O
quickly O
and O
it O
's O
very O
noticeable O
. O

It O
all O
just O
makes O
sense O
. O

I O
love O
it O
so O
much O

I O

You O
ca O
n't O
even O
get O
a O

card I-AS
which O
is O
why O
I O
bought O
to O
begin O
with O
. O

I O
use O
it O

would O

The O

, O
before O
the O
battery B-AS
completely O
died O
of O

left O
much O
to O
be O

Do O
yourself O
a O

, O
this O
is O
not O
a O
fake O
story O
trying O
to O

It O
is O
a O
REAL O

, O
not O
the O
toy O
I O
saw O
in O
other O
brands O
. O

It O
has O
worked O
fine O
. O

The O
most O
amazing O
part O
to O
me O
as O
a O
PC O
user O
is O
the O
startup O
and O
shutdown O
times O
, O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
you O
very O
rarely O
have O
to O
restart O
the O
thing O
. O

Long O
story O
, O
but O
after O
many O
calls O
to O
various O
offices O
, O
I O
was O
told O
that O
no O
one O
can O
override O
the O
depot B-AS
and O
that O
managers O
do O
n't O
take O
phone O
calls O
or O
e O

I O
can O
throw O
anything O
at O
it O
and O
I O
do O
, O
Pictures O
, O
video O
editing O
, O
schoolwork O
. O

Price B-AS
and O
purpose O
is O
awesome O
! O

Wonderful O
zooming B-AS
. O

The O
screen B-AS
is O
huge O
and O
coloful O
, O
but O
no O
LED O
backlighting O
. O

the O
two O
of O
us O
use O
it O
regularly O
. O

In O
all O
honesty O
, O
if O
someone O
is O
looking O
for O
a O
quality O
laptop O
and O
willing O
to O
pay O
a O
little O
more O
money O
for O
a O
normal O
sized B-AS
laptop O
than O
a O
cheaper O
and O
less O
impressive O
laptop O
, O
then O
do O
not O
buy O
this O
computer O
. O

Everything O
about O
this O
computer O
is O
easy O
to O
use B-AS
. O

After O
paying O
over O
$ O
1000 O
for O
this O
computer O
, O
it O
was O
not O
worth O
it O
. O

Worse O
, O
for O
the O
price B-AS
I O
could O
get O
a O
* O
netbook O
* O
that O
outperforms O
this O
machine O
. O

Very O
happy O
with O
my O
7th O
Toshiba O
laptop O
! O

My O
wife O
recently O
purchased O
an O
Apple O
MacBook O
Pro O
and O
our O
granddaughter O
fell O
in O
love O
with O
it O
and O
asked O
for O
one O
for O
her O
birthday O
. O

It O
had O
most O
of O
the O
features B-AS
and O
all O
of O
the O
power B-AS
that O
I O
wanted O
to O
replace O
my O
desktop O
machine O
. O

Keyboard B-AS
was O
also O
very O
nice O
and O
had O
a O
solid O
feel O
. O

I O
will O
only O
buy O
apple O
laptops O
from O
now O
on O
. O

I O
would O
definitely O
suggest O
this O
laptop O
! O

It O
did O
not O
have O
all O
the O
features B-AS
I O
expected O
it O
to O
have O
. O

Just O
a O
bunch O
of O
idiots O
who O
's O
English O
as O
a O
5th O
language O
is O
forced O
at O
best O
. O

No O
luck O
, O
although O
I O
waited O
for O
hours O
on O
the O
phone O
- O
Visited O
MacHouse O
, O
they O
stated O
the O
their O
call B-AS
center I-AS
is O
down O
due O
to O
too O
many O
phonecalls O
difficult O
to O
believe O
. O

There O
is O
a O
backlit B-AS
keyboard I-AS
which O
is O
perfect O
for O
typing O
in O
the O
dark O
. O

It O
has O
a O
lot O
of O
memory B-AS
and O
a O
great O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
. O

I O
spoke O
with O
a O
service B-AS
rep I-AS
at O
Micro O
Center O
and O
his O
girlfriend O
is O
having O
the O
same O
problem O
with O
her O
power B-AS
adapter I-AS
, O
so O
it O
's O
not O
just O
an O
isolated O
incident O
! O
! O
! O

They O
had O
me O
send O
in O
the O
machine O
last O
April O
returned O
it O
to O
me O
in O
May O
with O
no O
documentation O
on O
what O
was O
done O
it O
anything O
. O

5 O
Cut O
my O
losses O
and O
sold O
it O
for O
parts O

All O
I O
can O
say O
is O
W O
- O
O O
- O
W O
. O

I O
love O
this O
program B-AS
, O
it O
is O
superior O
to O
windows B-AS
movie I-AS
maker I-AS
. O

Which O
is O
what O
I O
did O
, O
check O
out O
my O
ACER O
5517 O
! O

He O
has O
replaced O
his O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
twice O
and O
of O
course O
has O
had O
to O
pay O
for O
antivirus B-AS
software I-AS
every O
year O
. O

This O
purchase O
opened O
me O
to O
the O
world O
of O
Macbooks O
, O
and O
I O
am O
impressed O
with O
the O
intuition O
of O
the O
design B-AS
, O
the O
beauty B-AS
of O
the O
product O
, O
and O
the O
excellent O
technological O
advances O
associated O
with O
it O
. O

I O
have O
loved O
this O
since O
i O
took O
it O
out O
of O
the O
box O
. O

The O
price B-AS
is O
great O
for O
this O
model O
, O
I O
only O
plan O
on O
using O
it O
for O
media O
in O
the O
entertainment O
room O
. O

It O
seemed O
to O
be O
a O
very O
nice O
laptop O
except O
I O
was O
not O
able O
to O
load O
my O
Garmin B-AS
GPS I-AS
software I-AS
or O
Microsoft B-AS
Office I-AS
2003 I-AS
. O

But O
, O
like O
I O
said O
before O
, O
the O
only O
reason O
I O
do O
n't O
currently O
have O
a O
Mac O
laptop O
is O
because O
all O
of O
their O
laptops O
are O
too O
pricey O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
also O
had O
to O
have O
the O
keyboard B-AS
replaced O
at O
my O
expense O
. O

I O
had O
the O
staff B-AS
telling O
me O
older O
version O
did O
not O
make O
the O
fan B-AS
noise I-AS
cause O
it O
is O
a O
different O
computer O
. O

Was O
very O
much O
worth O
the O
price B-AS
i O
paid O
. O

So O
far O
, O
so O
good O
. O

Even O
out O
of O
warranty B-AS
! O

A O
tip O
for O
people O
looking O
into O
this O
computer O
, O
DO O
NOT O
BUY O
IT O
save O
up O
a O
bit O
more O
money O
and O
buy O
a O
computer O
that O
will O
last O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
little O
computer O
for O
the O
price B-AS
. O

This O
comes O
in O
very O
handy O
for O
me O
as O
an O
educator O
. O

Crisp O
screen B-AS
, O
great O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
, O
and O
plenty O
of O
storage B-AS
. O

It O
's O
a O
long O
and O
tirring O
process O
that O
after O
a O
while O
it O
seems O
like O
their O
game O
plan O
was O
to O
wear O
you O
out O
so O
you O
would O
want O
to O
give O
up O
on O
contacting O
them O
. O

All O
apple B-AS
associates I-AS
are O
always O
wiling O
to O
help O
you O
out O
with O
anything O
, O
no O
matter O
when O
you O
purchased O
the O
computer O
and O
how O
many O
years O
passed O
. O

I O
was O
waiting O
for O
this O
model O
to O
be O
released O
since O
January O
, O
and O
have O
been O
holding O
off O
on O
buying O
a O
Macbook O
Pro O
until O
the O
new O
model O
came O
out O
. O

I O
will O
never O
buy O
another O
HP O
computer O
. O

So O
i O
would O
not O
reccomend O
anyone O
buying O
this O
computer O

You O
will O
regret O
it O
if O
you O
buy O
any O
dell O
. O

i O
think O
that O
anyone O
looking O
for O
a O
good O
durrable O
laptop O
then O
this O
is O
the O
way O
to O
go O
. O

Also O
, O
my O
sister O
got O
the O
exact O
same O
laptop O
since O
they O
were O
so O
cheap O
and O
after O
8 O
months O
, O
the O
screen B-AS
split O
in O
half O
just O
from O
everyday O
use O
. O

It O
started O
out O
getting O
hot O
after O
only O
a O
few O
months O
. O

The O
Toshiba O
Satellite O
has O
been O
more O
than O
I O
expected O
for O
the O
price B-AS
. O

I O
had O
to O
adjust O
my O
mousepad B-AS
sensitivity I-AS
, O
because O
it O
is O
very O
sensitive O
. O

I O
wish O
iWork B-AS
or O
MS B-AS
Office I-AS
came O
with O
the O
Mac O
, O
but O
MS B-AS
Office I-AS
does O
n't O
even O
come O
with O
most O
pc O
laptops O
. O

To O
my O
mind O
much O
more O
usable O
than O
the O
toy O
called O
an O
IPad O
. O

It O
allows O
me O
to O
do O
everything O
I O
need O
from O
a O
computer O
and O
more O
. O

The O
best O
thing O
is O
even O
while O
doing O
almost O
ten O
or O
twenty O
things O
at O
once O
, O
it O
never O
slows O
down O
. O

Keyboard B-AS
is O
plastic O
and O
spongey O
feeling O
. O

which O
Apple O
does O
n't O
offer O
, O
is O
why O
I O
bought O
my O
MacBook O
at O
Best O
Buy O
. O

previous O
laptops O
were O
pc O
's O
, O
still O
have O
them O
, O
but O
the O
mac B-AS
osx I-AS
is O
a O
clean O
and O
smooth O
operating B-AS
system I-AS
. O

The O
computer O
is O
a O
dream O
come O
true O
. O

i O
also O
love O
having O
the O
extra O
calculator O
number O
set O
up O
on O
the O
keyboard B-AS
which O
most O
laptops O
do O
not O
have O
. O

I O
' O
m O
glad O
I O
made O
the O
choice O
to O
switch O
and O
buy O
this O
MAC O
. O

Because O
he O
said O
that O
the O
hinge B-AS
is O
under O
the O
motherboard B-AS
and O
they O
have O
to O
dismantle O
the O
whole O
thing O
before O
it O
can O
be O
tightened O
. O

You O
can O
do O
it O
all O
on O
this O
bad O
boy O
but O
the O
main O
thing O
this O
netbook O
was O
desinged O
for O
was O
surfing B-AS
the I-AS
web I-AS
and O
boy O
o O
boy O
does O
it O
ever O
. O

I O
love O
my O
Apple O
, O
it O
is O
quick O
and O
easy O
to O
use B-AS
. O

I O
took O
it O
to O
the O
shop O
and O
they O
said O
It O
would O
cost O
too O
much O
to O
repair O
it O
. O

Did O
n't O
expect O
to O
repair O
it O
at O
once O
! O

It O
is O
quiet O
and O
a O
real O
joy O
to O
watch O
work O

With O
notes O

replaced O
the O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS

The O
laptop O
is O
relatively O
simple O
to O
use B-AS
, O
though O
I O
bought O
Macs O
for O
Dummies O
, O
which O
is O
well O
worth O
$ O
2 O

Ca O
n't O
close O
the O
2nd O
HDD B-AS
bay I-AS
since O
there O
are O
brackets O
you O
have O
to O
break O
off O
even O
then O
, O
it O
still O
does O
n't O
shut O
That O
could O
be O
a O
major O
flaw O
for O
the O
dual O
HDD O
user O
. O

From O
the O
start O
, O
when O
you O
open O
the O
box O
you O
see O
a O
completely O
different O
class O
of O
machine O

No O

The O

carrying I-AS

arrived O
in O
two O

The O

is O
among O
the O
best O

Very O

If O
you O
are O
a O
person O
like O
me O
, O
more O
on O
the O
creative O
side O

the O
mac O
has O
something O
for O
you O
too O
. O

I O
had O
to O
have O
these O
computers O
in O
my O
school O
. O

Thus O
, O
when O
you O
carry O
it O
at O
a O
slanted O
angle O
, O
the O
screen B-AS
will O
topple O
or O
slide O
down O
, O
if O
you O
understand O
what O
I O
mean O

first O
i O
have O
been O
searching O
for O
long O
time O
before O
i O
decided O
to O
get O
mac O

It O
's O
now O
all O
commodity B-AS

We O
also O
use O

I O
was O
so O
excited O
when O
my O
dad O
said O
i O
could O
get O
a O
new O
laptop O
for O
my O
birthday O
. O

We O
purchased O
this O
as O
a O
back O
up O
computer O
after O
our O
more O
expensive O
HP O
needed O
to O
be O
repaired O
. O

-They O
reported O
that O
the O
computer O
is O
in O
their O
headquarters O
. O

bought O

How O
Toshiba O
handles O
the O
repair B-AS
seems O
to O
vary O
, O
some O
folks O
indicate O
that O
they O
were O
charged O
for O
even O
an O
intial O
fix O
, O
others O
had O
the O
repair B-AS
done O
5 O
times O
. O

I O
would O
like O
to O
use O
a O
different O
operating B-AS
system I-AS
altogether O
. O

All O
of O
them O
were O
Windows O
machines O
. O

Well O
, O
I O
had O
completed O
the O
presentation O
in O
powerpoint O
the O
night O
before O
on O
my O
PC O
, O
but O
took O
the O
Apple O
to O
the O
conference O
. O

The O
latest O
and O
mightiest O
Macbook O
pro O
17-inch O
was O
bought O
by O
my O
university O
on O
the O
30th O
of O
June O
2009 O
. O

I O
have O
a O
business O
website O
and O
every O
time O
I O
have O
to O
change O
something O
I O
have O
to O
go O
to O
the O
public O
library O
to O
use O
a O
PC O
. O

I O
paid O
about O
the O
same O
for O
my O
Toshiba O
as O
I O
did O
for O
the O
compaq O
a O
few O
years O
back O
. O

This O
was O
an O
update O
from O
an O
early O
MacBook O
Pro O
. O

I O
think O
I O
might O
rather O
suffer O
for O
something O
that O
is O
simple O
to O
fix O
in O
my O
opinion O
. O
