But O
the O
staff B-AS
was O
so O
horrible O
to O
us O
. O

To O
be O
completely O
fair O
, O
the O
only O
redeeming O
factor O
was O
the O
food B-AS
, O
which O
was O
above O
average O
, O
but O
could O
n't O
make O
up O
for O
all O
the O
other O
deficiencies O
of O
Teodora O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
uniformly O
exceptional O
, O
with O
a O
very O
capable O
kitchen B-AS
which O
will O
proudly O
whip O
up O
whatever O
you O
feel O
like O
eating O
, O
whether O
it O
's O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
or O
not O
. O

Where O
Gabriela O
personaly O
greets O
you O
and O
recommends O
you O
what O
to O
eat O
. O

For O
those O
that O
go O
once O
and O
do O
n't O
enjoy O
it O
, O
all O
I O
can O
say O
is O
that O
they O
just O
do O
n't O
get O
it O
. O

Not O
only O
was O
the O
food B-AS
outstanding O
, O
but O
the O
little O
perks B-AS
were O
great O
. O

It O
is O
very O
overpriced O
and O
not O
very O
tasty O
. O

Our O
agreed O
favorite O
is O
the O
orrechiete B-AS
with I-AS
sausage I-AS
and I-AS
chicken I-AS
usually O
the O
waiters B-AS
are O
kind O
enough O
to O
split O
the O
dish B-AS
in O
half O
so O
you O
get O
to O
sample O
both O
meats B-AS
. O

The O
Bagels B-AS
have O
an O
outstanding O
taste O
with O
a O
terrific O
texture O
, O
both O
chewy O
yet O
not O
gummy O
. O

Nevertheless O
the O
food B-AS
itself O
is O
pretty O
good O
. O

They O
did O
not O
have O
mayonnaise B-AS
, O
forgot O
our O
toast B-AS
, O
left O
out O
ingredients B-AS
ie O
cheese B-AS
in O
an O
omelet B-AS
, O
below O
hot O
temperatures O
and O
the O
bacon B-AS
was O
so O
over O
cooked O
it O
crumbled O
on O
the O
plate B-AS
when O
you O
touched O
it O
. O

It O
took O
half O
an O
hour O
to O
get O
our O
check B-AS
, O
which O
was O
perfect O
since O
we O
could O
sit O
, O
have O
drinks B-AS
and O
talk O
! O

The O
design B-AS
and O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
just O
as O
good O
. O

He O
has O
visited O
Thailand O
and O
is O
quite O
expert O
on O
the O
cuisine B-AS
. O

I O
would O
definitely O
recommend O
Mary O
's O
and O
am O
making O
it O
one O
of O
my O
regular O
neighborhood O
haunts O
. O

The O
pizza B-AS
is O
the O
best O
if O
you O
like O
thin O
crusted O
pizza B-AS
. O

My O
Girlfriend O
and O
I O
stumbled O
onto O
this O
hopping O
place O
the O
other O
night O
and O
had O
a O
great O
time O
! O

He O
ca O
n't O
help O
, O
they O
're O
bought O
up O
so O
fast O
. O

Secondly O
, O
on O
this O
night O
the O
place O
was O
overwhelmed O
by O
upper O
east O
side O
ladies O
perfume O
. O

i O
have O
eaten O
here O
a O
handful O
of O
times O
, O
for O
no O
reason O
besides O
sheer O
convenience O
. O

Obviously O
run O
by O
folks O
who O
know O
a O
pie O
. O

We O
were O
very O
disappointed O
. O

IT O
IS O
DEFINITELY O
SPECIAL O
AND O
AFFORDABLE O
. O

I O
really O
liked O
this O
place O
. O

I O
will O
be O
going O
back O
very O
soon O
. O

All O
the O
money O
went O
into O
the O
interior B-AS
decoration I-AS
, O
none O
of O
it O
went O
to O
the O
chefs B-AS
. O

The O
seats B-AS
are O
uncomfortable O
if O
you O
are O
sitting O
against O
the O
wall O
on O
wooden O
benches O
. O

I O
asked O
for O
seltzer B-AS
with I-AS
lime I-AS
, O
no O
ice O
. O

It O
was O
pretty O
inexpensive O
too O
. O

Will O
not O
be O
back O
. O

Do O
n't O
go O
alone O
-- O
-even O
two O
people O
is O
n't O
enough O
for O
the O
whole O
experience O
, O
with O
pickles B-AS
and O
a O
selection B-AS
of I-AS
meats I-AS
and I-AS
seafoods I-AS
. O

My O
suggestion O
is O
to O
eat B-AS
family I-AS
style I-AS
because O
you O
'll O
want O
to O
try O
the O
other O
dishes B-AS
. O

Best O
of O
all O
is O
the O
warm O
vibe B-AS
, O
the O
owner B-AS
is O
super O
friendly O
and O
service B-AS
is O
fast O
. O

This O
is O
n't O
a O
value O
joint O
. O

Faan O
's O
got O
a O
great O
concept O
but O
a O
little O
rough O
on O
the O
delivery B-AS
. O

From O
the O
incredible O
food B-AS
, O
to O
the O
warm O
atmosphere B-AS
, O
to O
the O
friendly O
service B-AS
, O
this O
downtown O
neighborhood O
spot O
does O
n't O
miss O
a O
beat O
. O

Great O
food B-AS
at O
REASONABLE O
prices B-AS
, O
makes O
for O
an O
evening O
that O
ca O
n't O
be O
beat O
! O

Look O
foward O
to O
trying O
the O
Ruben O
upon O
returning O
. O

The O
only O
other O
steakhouse O
that O
seems O
to O
hold O
a O
candle O
to O
Roth O
's O
is O
the O
Strip O
House O
. O

We O
usually O
go O
to O
the O
Chart O
House O
to O
celebrate O
a O
birthday O
or O
anniversary O
. O

this O
little O
place O
has O
a O
cute O
interior B-AS
decor I-AS
and O
affordable O
city O
prices B-AS
. O

You O
'll O
adore O
it O
. O

Two O
words O
, O
Free O
wine B-AS
. O

The O
price B-AS
is O
reasonable O
although O
the O
service B-AS
is O
poor O
. O

The O
quantity B-AS
is O
also O
very O
good O
, O
you O
will O
come O
out O
satisfied O
. O

I O
have O
been O
to O
Roth O
's O
twice O
and O
both O
times O
were O
very O
disappointing O
. O

Worth O
visiting O
the O
1st O
Ave O
spot O
because O
it O
is O
the O
original O
store O
. O

I O
stumbled O
upon O
this O
second O
floor O
walk O
- O
up O
two O
Fridays O
ago O
when O
I O
was O
with O
two O
friends O
in O
town O
from O
LA O
Being O
serious O
sushi B-AS
lovers O
, O
we O
sat O
at O
the O
sushi B-AS
bar O
to O
be O
closer O
to O
the O
action O
. O

Raga O
's O
is O
a O
romantic O
, O
cozy O
restaurant O
. O

The O
fried B-AS
rice I-AS
is O
amazing O
here O
. O

Three O
courses B-AS
, O
choices O
include O
excellent O
mussels B-AS
, O
puff B-AS
pastry I-AS
goat I-AS
cheese I-AS
and O
salad B-AS
with I-AS
a I-AS
delicious I-AS
dressing I-AS
, O
and O
a O
hanger B-AS
steak I-AS
au I-AS
poivre I-AS
that O
is O
out O
of O
this O
world O
. O

it O
's O
a O
perfect O
place O
to O
have O
a O
amanzing O
indian B-AS
food I-AS
. O

The O
place B-AS
is O
so O
cool O
and O
the O
service B-AS
is O
prompt O
and O
curtious O
. O

At O
the O
end O
you O
're O
left O
with O
a O
mild O
broth B-AS
with I-AS
noodles I-AS
that O
you O
can O
slurp O
out O
of O
a O
cup O
. O

I O
just O
wonder O
how O
you O
can O
have O
such O
a O
delicious O
meal B-AS
for O
such O
little O
money B-AS
. O

The O
food O
was O
delicious O
but O
do O
not O
come O
here O
on O
a O
empty O
stomach O
. O

The O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
is O
excellent O
. O

so O
garantuan O
that O
you O
ca O
n't O
fit O
them O
in O
a O
toaster O
. O

I O
ve O
been O
to O
many O
Thai O
restaurants O
in O
Manhattan O
before O
, O
and O
Toons O
is O
by O
far O
the O
best O
Thai B-AS
food I-AS
I O
ve O
had O
except O
for O
my O
mom O
's O
of O
course O
. O

They O
would O
n't O
even O
let O
me O
finish O
my O
glass B-AS
of I-AS
wine I-AS
before O
offering O
another O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
the O
Sophia O
pizza O
. O

Whem O
asked O
, O
we O
had O
to O
ask O
more O
detailed O
questions O
so O
that O
we O
knew O
what O
the O
specials B-AS
were O
. O

This O
is O
a O
consistently O
great O
place O
to O
dine B-AS
for O
lunch B-AS
or O
dinner B-AS
. O

Nice O
atmosphere B-AS
, O
the O
service B-AS
was O
very O
pleasant O
and O
the O
desert B-AS
was O
good O
. O

All O
the O
people O
that O
I O
bring O
there O
go O
back O
on O
their O
own O
and O
bring O
THEIR O
friends O
! O

After O
really O
enjoying O
ourselves O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
we O
sat O
down O
at O
a O
table B-AS
and O
had O
dinner B-AS
. O

Fabulous O
service B-AS
, O
fantastic O
food B-AS
, O
and O
a O
chilled O
out O
atmosphere B-AS
and O
environment B-AS
. O

Not O
what O
I O
wanted O
to O
hear O
. O

Try O
the O
lasagnette B-AS
appetizer I-AS
. O

Pricey O
, O
but O
worth O
a O
try O
, O
at O
least O
once O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
been O
there O
a O
few O
times O
, O
and O
I O
usually O
end O
up O
sitting O
next O
to O
some O
pretty O
odd O
people O
. O

I O
liked O
the O
beer B-AS
selection I-AS
! O

Great O
food B-AS
, O
good O
size O
menu B-AS
, O
great O
service B-AS
and O
an O
unpretensious O
setting B-AS
. O

Go O
here O
for O
a O
romantic O
dinner B-AS
but O
not O
for O
an O
all O
out O
wow O
dining B-AS
experience O
. O

Ca O
n't O
wait O
to O
go O
back O
. O

I O
grew O
up O
eating O
Dosa B-AS
and O
have O
yet O
to O
find O
a O
place O
in O
NY O
to O
satisfy O
my O
taste O
buds O
. O

Wine B-AS
list I-AS
selection I-AS
is O
good O
and O
wine B-AS
- I-AS
by I-AS
- I-AS
the I-AS
- I-AS
glass I-AS
was O
generously O
filled O
to O
the O
top O
. O

With O
the O
great O
variety O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
I O
eat O
here O
often O
and O
never O
get O
bored O
. O

The O
menu B-AS
is O
very O
limited O
, O
i O
think O
we O
counted O
4 O
or O
5 O
entrees B-AS
. O

If O
you O
are O
a O
carnivore O
, O
come O
hungry O
and O
you O
will O
leave O
more O
satisfied O
than O
you O
have O
ever O
been O
. O

The O
menu B-AS
is O
limited O
but O
almost O
all O
of O
the O
dishes B-AS
are O
excellent O
. O

Not O
too O
crazy O
about O
their O
sake B-AS
martini I-AS
. O

Great O
bagels B-AS
, O
spreads B-AS
and O
a O
good O
place O
to O
hang O
out O
in O
. O

The O
service O
varys O
from O
day O
to O
day O
sometimes O
they O
're O
very O
nice O
, O
and O
sometimes O
not O
. O

whoever O
the O
jazz O
duo O
was O
, O
they O
were O
on O
POINT O
. O

One O
thing O
I O
liked O
about O
this O
place O
is O
that O
I O
never O
felt O
rushed O
or O
pressured O
to O
give O
up O
my O
table B-AS
ot O
incoming O
guests O
. O

This O
place O
is O
a O
great O
bargain O
. O

We O
happened O
upon O
this O
place O
purely O
by O
accident O
and O
were O
pleased O
with O
the O
results O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
the O
food B-AS
is O
outstanding O
, O
but O
everything O
else O
about O
this O
restaurant O
is O
the O
pits O
. O

Deff O
recimmend O
Bukhara O
they O
also O
have O
opened O
two O
new O
locations O
guess O
ill O
try O
them O
out O
. O

We O
always O
have O
a O
delicious O
meal B-AS
and O
always O
leave O
feeling O
satisfied O
. O

Dip O
the O
ingredients B-AS
in O
with O
your O
chopsticks B-AS
, O
swirl O
them O
around O
, O
and O
eat O
. O

First O
went O
here O
to O
enjoy O
their O
garden B-AS
terrace I-AS
. O

My O
husbands O
was O
perfect O
, O
my O
was O
well O
done O
and O
dry O
. O

Everyone O
I O
have O
spoken O
too O
there O
is O
super O
friendly O
, O
helpful O
, O
and O
willing O
to O
the O
extra O
mile O
for O
a O
customer O
. O

The O
pizza B-AS
was O
pretty O
good O
and O
huge O
. O

Sapphire O
is O
the O
only O
Indian O
restaurant O
I O
go O
to O
when O
I O
' O
m O
in O
NYC O
. O

The O
cuisine B-AS
from O
what O
I O
' O
ve O
gathered O
is O
authentic O
Taiwanese O
, O
though O
its O
very O
different O
from O
what O
I O
' O
ve O
been O
accustomed O
to O
in O
Taipei O
. O

I O
heartily O
recommend O
. O

Heartland O
Brewery O
is O
by O
far O
one O
of O
the O
best O
places O
in O
NYC O
to O
make O
new O
friends O
and O
catch O
up O
with O
old O
ones O
. O

I O
almost O
hesititate O
to O
write O
a O
review O
because O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
was O
so O
great O
and O
I O
would O
hate O
for O
it O
too O
become O
to O
crowded O
. O

They O
are O
often O
crowded B-AS
on O
the O
weekends O
but O
they O
are O
efficient O
and O
accurate O
with O
their O
service B-AS
. O

All O
my O
co O
- O
workers O
were O
amazed O
at O
how O
small O
the O
dish B-AS
was O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
unheralded O
, O
the O
service B-AS
impecible O
, O
and O
the O
food B-AS
magnifica O
n't O
. O

We O
ordered O
the O
special O
, O
grilled B-AS
branzino I-AS
, O
that O
was O
so O
infused O
with O
bone O
, O
it O
was O
difficult O
to O
eat O
. O

The O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
is O
friendly O
, O
and O
the O
food B-AS
has O
gotten O
better O
and O
better O
! O

This O
place O
, O
which O
is O
only O
a O
few O
months O
old O
, O
is O
perhaps O
Queens O
biggest O
secret O
! O

It O
may O
be O
a O
bit O
packed B-AS
on O
weekends O
, O
but O
the O
vibe B-AS
is O
good O
and O
it O
is O
the O
best O
French B-AS
food I-AS
you O
will O
find O
in O
the O
area O
. O

This O
place O
is O
so O
much O
fun O
. O

I O
was O
glad O
I O
did O
. O

Right O
off O
the O
L O
in O
Brooklyn O
this O
is O
a O
nice O
cozy O
place B-AS
with O
good O
pizza B-AS
. O

I O
' O
ve O
never O
been O
treated O
so O
rudely O
. O

I O
'll O
be O
back O
soon O
. O

Le O
Pere O
Pinard O
has O
a O
$ O
15 O
pre B-AS
- I-AS
theater I-AS
menu I-AS
that O
is O
outstanding O
. O

Went O
inside O
and O
I O
started O
to O
get O
excited O
. O

I O
also O
order B-AS
for O
delivery B-AS
and O
the O
restaurant O
forgot O
half O
the O
order B-AS
. O

Our O
server B-AS
checked O
on O
us O
maybe O
twice O
during O
the O
entire O
meal B-AS
. O

However O
, O
it O
is O
jus O
too O
good O
to O
not O
praise O
it O
. O

We O
have O
been O
to O
Montparnasse O
many O
times O
and O
return O
often O
for O
good O
reason O
. O

The O
strong O
scents B-AS
coming O
from O
the O
left O
and O
right O
of O
me O
negatively O
affected O
my O
taste O
buds O
. O

We O
had O
the O
lobster B-AS
sandwich I-AS
and O
it O
was O
FANTASTIC O
. O

It O
's O
somewhere O
you O
can O
eat O
and O
be O
happy O
. O

If O
you O
wrote O
a O
bad O
review O
, O
it O
's O
because O
you O
do O
n't O
understand O
what O
Rao O
's O
is O
all O
about O
. O

Had O
we O
been O
stalling O
I O
could O
understand O
where O
they O
were O
coming O
from O
, O
but O
we O
had O
been O
there O
less O
than O
an O
hour O
and O
they O
had O
n't O
even O
brought O
us O
a O
check B-AS
yet O
! O

but O
overall O
i O
give O
it O
a O
10 O

Though O
the O
Spider O
Roll O
may O
look O
like O
a O
challenge O
to O
eat O
, O
with O
soft O
shell B-AS
crab I-AS
hanging O
out O
of O
the O
roll O
, O
it O
is O
well O
worth O
the O
price B-AS
you O
pay O
for O
them O
. O

Deep B-AS
Fried I-AS
Skewers I-AS
are O
good O
and O
still O
rare O
to O
find O
in O
NYC O
. O

I O
have O
tried O
to O
make O
reservations B-AS
, O
but O
both O
times O
, O
the O
hostess B-AS
did O
n't O
have O
my O
name O
. O

I O
also O
recommend O
the O
rice B-AS

An O
oasis O
of O
refinement O
, O
Food O
, O
though O
somewhat O
uneven O
, O
often O
reaches O
the O
pinnacles O
of O
new O
American O
fine O
cuisine B-AS
, O
chef B-AS
's O
passion O
and O
kitchen B-AS
's O
precise O
execution O

evident O
in O
the O
fish B-AS

If O

quite O
an O
expert O
on O
it O
. O

Some O
baby B-AS
pizzas I-AS
get O
their O
wish O
. O

Plenty O
of O
choices O
to O
make O
your O
own O
creation O

I O
felt O
like O
I O
was O
eating O
in O
someone O

living O
room O

I O
was O
there O
on O

worth O
it O

The O
lava B-AS

and O
I O
recommend O
it O
. O

VT O
is O
what O
baby B-AS
pizzas I-AS
hope O
to O
be O
when O
they O
grow O
up O
. O

From O
the O
terrible O
service B-AS
, O
to O
the O
bland O
food B-AS
, O
not O
to O
mention O
the O
unaccommodating O
managers B-AS
, O
the O
overall O
experience O
was O
horrible O
. O

Lahore O
is O
a O
great O
place O
to O
duck O
into O
late O
- O
night O
when O
you O
need O
some O
really O
tasty O
food B-AS
on O
the O
cheap O
- O
you O
'll O
likely O
have O
trouble O
finishing O
the O
amount O
of O
food B-AS
you O
get O
for O
FOUR O
DOLLARS O
. O

The O
last O
time O
I O
went O
we O
were O
seated O
at O
a O
table B-AS
in O
a O
corridor O
next O
to O
the O
kitchen O
. O

good O
selection B-AS
of I-AS
wines I-AS
ranging O
from O
affordable O
to O
high O
end O
. O

Nice O
restaurant O
overall O
, O
with O
classic O
upscale O
Italian B-AS
decor I-AS
. O

Not O
impressed O
with O
the O
food B-AS
. O

The O
entire O
dining B-AS
experience I-AS
was O
wonderful O
! O

The O
wine B-AS
selection I-AS
by O
the O
glass O
and O
bottle O
is O
wonderful O
and O
I O
always O
recommend O
that O
friends O
make O
a O
reservation B-AS
if O
they O
're O
going O
to O
be O
in O
town O
. O

Service B-AS
is O
highly O
refined O
, O
our O
seating O
was O
delayed O
35 O
minutes O
past O
our O
reservation B-AS
and O
the O
maitre B-AS
d O
apologized O
and O
regularly O
kept O
us O
apprised O
of O
progress O
. O

Order O
the O
panang B-AS
duck I-AS
, O
it O
's O
fantastic O
. O

Food O
is O
usually O
very O
good O
, O
though O
ocasionally O
I O
wondered O
about O
freshmess O
of O
raw B-AS
vegatables I-AS
in O
side O
orders O
. O

Other O
than O
the O
crappy O
service B-AS
from O
two O
individuals O
, O
it O
's O
great O
. O

What O
more O
can O
you O
ask O
for O
? O

Wondering O
who O
had O
the O
best O
deals O
we O
noticed O
a O
line O
had O
formed O
to O
wait O
for O
this O
one O
particular O
establishment O
. O

They O
have O
authentic O
Indian B-AS
at O
amazin O
prices B-AS
. O

You O
are O
treated O
just O
like O
royality O
. O

There O
's O
nice O
and O
quiet O
, O
small O
but O
enough O
for O
6 O
or O
more O
. O

Ambiance B-AS
relaxed O
and O
stylish O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
never O
felt O
more O
unwelcome O
than O
last O
month O
at O
Jimmy O
's O
Bronx O
Cafe O
. O

Luckily O
we O
saved O
room O
for O
the O
BBQ B-AS
Salmon I-AS
, O
Sea B-AS
Bass I-AS
and O
Crispy B-AS
Duck I-AS
. O

Yes O
, O
they O
use O
fancy O
ingredients B-AS
, O
but O
even O
fancy O
ingredients B-AS
do O
n't O
make O
for O
good O
pizza B-AS
unless O
someone O
knows O
how O
to O
get O
the O
crust B-AS
right O
. O

Looking O
from O
the O
outside O
in O
, O
one O
would O
hesitate O
to O
enter O
this O
hole O
in O
the O
wall O
really O
, O
that O
's O
what O
it O
is O
. O

and O
yes O
Dal B-AS
Bukhara I-AS
is O
so O
dam O
good O
and O
so O
are O
all O
the O
kababs B-AS
. O

I O
look O
forward O
to O
eating B-AS
here O
again O

I O
' O
ve O
been O
coming O
here O
as O
a O
child O
and O
always O
come O
back O
for O
the O
taste B-AS
. O

Tuk O
Tuk O
is O
one O
of O
those O
comfortable O
neighborhood O
joints O
where O
you O
know O
you O
will O
always O
have O
a O
good O
meal B-AS
at O
a O
fair O
price B-AS
. O

A O
glass B-AS
of I-AS
Leaping I-AS
Lizard I-AS
, O
a O
glass B-AS
of I-AS
prosecco I-AS
, O
and O
the O
mussels B-AS
had O
everything O
happy O
. O

Food B-AS
was O
average O
and O
creme B-AS
brulee I-AS
was O
awful O
, O
the O
sugar B-AS
was O
charred O
, O
not O
caramelized O
and O
smelled O
of O
kerosene O
. O

The O
food B-AS
always O
tastes O
fresh O
and O
served B-AS
promptly O
. O

I O
know O
because O
I O
live O
nearby O
. O

The O
pizza B-AS
here O
is O
delicious O
. O

My O
entire O
family O
was O
horrified O
. O

On O
a O
monthly O
basis O
my O
friends O
and O
I O
get O
together O
and O
have O
a O
girls O
night O
out O
. O

Pizza B-AS
and O
garlic B-AS
knots I-AS
are O
great O
as O
well O
, O
I O
order O
from O
them O
quite O
often O
and O
the O
delivery B-AS
is O
always O
super O
quick O
! O

For O
great O
chinese B-AS
food I-AS
nearby O
, O
you O
have O
Wu O
Liang O
Ye O
and O
Grand O
Sichuan O
just O
a O
block O
away O
. O

But O
who O
says O
Murray O
's O
is O
anything O
about O
service B-AS
. O

This O
place O
is O
really O
trendi O
but O
they O
have O
forgotten O
about O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
a O
restaurant O
, O
the O
food B-AS
. O

I O
have O
NEVER O
been O
disappointed O
in O
the O
Red O
Eye O
. O

Hats O
off O
to O
the O
chef B-AS
. O

This O
should O
have O
been O
done O
in O
a O
back O
room O
, O
away O
from O
customers O
. O

Service B-AS
could O
be O
improved O
but O
overall O
this O
is O
a O
place O
that O
understands O
the O
importance O
of O
little O
things O
the O
heavy O
, O
black O
, O
antique O
- O
seeming O
teapot B-AS
, O
for O
one O
in O
the O
restaurant O
experience O
. O

Glad O
you O
have O
the O
luxury O
to O
throw O
out O
paying O
customers O
. O

The O
pizza B-AS
is O
delicious O
, O
they O
use O
fresh B-AS
mozzarella I-AS
instead O
of O
the O
cheap O
, O
frozen O
, O
shredded O
cheese B-AS
common O
to O
most O
pizza B-AS
's O
. O

Its O
an O
excellent O
place B-AS
to O
relax O
and O
the O
food B-AS
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
in O
the O
city O
of O
New O
York O
. O

service B-AS
is O
friendly O
, O
and O
never O
had O
a O
problem O
walking O
in O
and O
getting B-AS
a I-AS
table I-AS
. O

The O
atmosphere O
was O
crowded O
but O
it O
was O
a O
great O
bistro B-AS
- I-AS
type I-AS
vibe I-AS
. O

Check O
it O
out O

First O
off O
, O
the O
waitress B-AS
was O
completely O
unattentive O
the O
2 O
times O
we O
saw O
herodd O
in O
a O
restaurant O
with O
6 O
tables B-AS
and O
got O
our O
order O
wrong O
. O

Do O
n't O
go O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
bland O
oily O
. O

But O
they O
do O
. O

What O
is O
even O
better O
, O
is O
that O
the O
prices B-AS
are O
very O
affordable O
as O
well O
, O
and O
the O
food B-AS
is O
really O
good O
. O

The O
fish B-AS
is O
fresh O
but O
the O
variety O
of O
fish B-AS
is O
nothing O
out O
of O
ordinary O
. O

Look O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
the O
people O
who O
wrote O
the O
reviews O
have O
ever O
been O
to O
a O
decent O
place O
PLEASE O
TRY O
SOMEOTHER O

Suan O

Our O
favorite O
meal B-AS
is O

pizza I-AS
, O
the O
house B-AS
salad I-AS
, O
and O
a O
good O
bottle B-AS
of I-AS

. O

And O
Kruno O
, O
the O
beverage B-AS
manager I-AS
is O
the O
best O
bartender B-AS
I O
have O
yet O
to O
come O
across O
. O

Ambiance B-AS
and O
music B-AS
funky O
, O
which O
I O
enjoy O
. O

The O
food B-AS
, O
drinks B-AS
and O
service B-AS
are O
clearly O
among O
the O
best O
in O
the O
city O
. O

I O
went O
there O
in O
late O
afternoon O
for O
some O
bite O
size O
food B-AS
and O
refleshment B-AS
with O
my O
date O
. O

It O
's O
a O
really O
great O
deal O
, O
considering O
we O
got O
full O
off O
of O
four O
dollars O
. O

I O
understand O
the O
area O
and O
folks O
you O
need O
not O
come O
here O
for O
the O
romantic O
, O
alluring O
ambiance B-AS
or O
the O
five O

featuring O
a O
sommlier B-AS
and O
a O
complicated O
maze O
of O

salmon I-AS
! O

I O
am O
completely O
hooked O
on O
this O
place O
, O
it O
is O
ridiculous O
. O

Eating O
in O
, O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
saves O
it O
, O
but O
at O
your O
desk O
, O
it O
's O
a O
very O
disappointing O
experience O
. O

Granted O
the O
space B-AS
is O
smaller O
than O
most O
, O
it O
is O
the O
best O
service B-AS
you O
will O
find O
in O
even O
the O
largest O
of O
restaurants O
. O

Have O
recommended O
the O
place O
to O
friends O

La O
Rosa O

by O
a O
swinging O
door O
to O
the O
Mexican O
restaurant O
Pacifico O
. O

It O
could O
have O
been O
handled O
better O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
attentive O
and O
her O
suggestions O
of O
menu B-AS
items I-AS
was O
right O
on O
the O
mark O
. O

The O
other O

the O
Outstanding O
Pizza B-AS
! O

It O
's O
a O
rather O
cramped O
and O
busy O
restaurant O
and O
it O
closes O
early O
. O

The O
environment B-AS
is O
romantic O
, O
but O
the O
food B-AS
is O
horrible O
, O
the O
service B-AS
is O
pathetic O
, O
and O
gabriella O
lies O
about O
everything O
she O
could O
. O

We O
had O
crawfish B-AS
boiled I-AS
and O
despite O
making O
a O
mess O
, O
it O
was O
a O
ton O
of O
fun O
and O
quite O
tasty O
as O
well O
. O

I O
had O
very O
high O
expectations O
for O
this O
place O
and O
made O
a O
reservation B-AS
a O
couple O
of O
months O
in O
advance O
for O
a O
special O
occasion O
. O

They O
were O
served O
warm O
and O
had O
a O
soft O
fluffy O
interior O
. O

What O
came O
to O
our O
table B-AS
was O
burned O
beyond O
recognition O
and O
stringy O
. O

I O
had O
the O
Pad B-AS
Thai I-AS
and O
the O
noodles B-AS
were O
sticky O
. O

So O
I O
' O
ve O
never O
actually O
been O
to O
M O
proper O
, O
but O
I O
' O
ve O
had O
it O
delivered B-AS
a O
few O
times O
. O

Among O
all O
of O
the O
new O
5th O
avenue O
restaurants O
, O
this O
offers O
by O
far O
one O
of O
the O
best O
values B-AS
for I-AS
your I-AS
money I-AS
. O

Frankly O
, O
when O
you O
compare O
what O
you O
can O
have O
here O
for O
lunch B-AS
, O
versus O
McDs O
or O
so O
many O
other O
sandwich O
shops O
in O
the O
city O
, O
there O
is O
no O
comparison O
. O

The O
hostess B-AS
is O
rude O
to O
the O
point O
of O
being O
offensive O
. O

If O
you O
're O
craving O
for O
Haru O
's O
great O
food B-AS

especially O

A O
narrow O
corridor B-AS
leads O
to O
a O
tiny O
space B-AS
where O
there O
are O
three O
tiny O
white O
tiled O
counters B-AS
, O
a O
great O

, O
cans O
and O
a O
small O
counter B-AS
holding O
12 O

The O

Succulent O

have O
rather O
tried O

This O
dish B-AS
is O
my O
favorite O
and O
I O
always O
get O
it O
when O
I O
go O
there O
and O
never O

of O
it O
. O

I O
also O
ordered O
the O
Change B-AS
Mojito I-AS
, O
which O
was O
out O
of O
this O
world O
. O

Okay O
service B-AS
. O

The O
only O
thing O
more O
wonderful O
than O
the O
food B-AS
which O
is O
exceptional O
is O
the O
service B-AS
. O

We O
were O
very O
pleasantly O
surprised O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
just O
awful O
, O
ATROCIOUS O
actually O
. O

I O
will O
never O
visit O
this O
restaurant O
again O

The O

pasta I-AS
was O
excellent O
, O
especially O

of I-AS
wine I-AS
that O
went O
very O
well O
with O
the O
food B-AS
. O

or O
sister O
, O
in O
my O
case O
! O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
eaten O
at O
many O
different O
Indian O
restaurants O
. O

They O
might O
be O
all O
business O
at O
the O
counter B-AS
when O
you O
give O
your O
order O
, O
but O
their O
food B-AS
says O
I O
love O
you O
. O

We O
are O
very O
particular O
about O
sushi B-AS
and O
were O
both O
please O
with O
every O
choice O
which O
included O
, O
ceviche B-AS
mix I-AS
( I-AS
special I-AS
) I-AS
, O
crab B-AS
dumplings I-AS
, O
assorted B-AS
sashimi I-AS
, O
sushi B-AS
and O
rolls B-AS
, O
two O
types O
of O
sake B-AS
, O
and O
the O
banana B-AS
tempura I-AS
. O

Try O
their O
plain B-AS
pizza I-AS
with O
fresh O
garlic B-AS
or O
eggplant B-AS
. O

Do O
n't O
go O
there O
! O

Ok O
, O
so O
the O
servers B-AS
wander O
around O
a O
little O
clueless O
, O
but O
there O
's O
more O
than O
enough O
servers B-AS
for O
the O
crowd O
they O
get O
- O
it O
's O
fine O
, O
you O
just O
have O
to O
make O
a O
small O
effort O
to O
get O
their O
attention O
. O

Good O
luck O
getting B-AS
a I-AS
table I-AS
. O

We O
picked O
it O
randomly O
, O
without O
a O
recommendation O
from O
someone O
who O
has O
been O
there O
, O
so O
we O
were O
n't O
sure O
what O
to O
expect O
. O

Do O
n't O
look O
down O
your O
nose O
at O
me O
like O
that O
. O

Planet O
Thai O
is O
great O
! O

The O
service B-AS
is O
awful O
. O

Just O
do O
n't O
do O
it O
. O

Just O
ignore O
the O
trendy O
wannabes O
. O

The O
takeout B-AS
menu I-AS
says O
to O
keep O
an O
eye O
out O
for O
an O
expanded O
menu B-AS
offering O
more O
italian B-AS
dishes I-AS
, O
I O
ca O
n't O
wait O
! O

Trust O
me O
, O
it O
will O
be O
great O
, O
and O
all O
of O
it O
will O
be O
devoured O
in O
no O
time O
. O

My O
girlfiends O
and O
I O
ate O
at O
OG O
again O
last O
night O
. O

I O
wish O
they O
had O
one O
near O
my O
office O
I O
would O
go O
everyday O
. O

Finally O
! O

Amma O
has O
the O
worst O
value O
for O
money O
I O
have O
experienced O
in O
NYC O
over O
the O
past O
2 O
years O
. O

I O
am O
not O
the O
most O
experienced O
person O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
Thai B-AS
food I-AS
, O
but O
my O
friend O
who O
took O
me O
there O
is O
. O

I O
think O
this O
would O
be O
a O
pretty O
good O
spot O
if O
it O
were O
not O
so O
overpriced O
and O
overrated O
. O

Regardless O
of O
whether O
there O
are O
two O
people O
or O
two O
hundred O
people O
ahead O
of O
you O
the O
hostess B-AS
will O
take O
your O
name O
and O
tell O
you O
Five O
minutes O
. O

The O
pizza B-AS
is O
good O
though O
. O

bottles B-AS
of I-AS
wine I-AS
are O
cheap O
and O
good O
. O

You O
will O
not O
be O
disapointed O
at O
all O
. O

Walk O
- O
ins O
are O
risky O
too O
. O

The O
have O
over O
100 O
different O
beers B-AS
to O
offer O
thier O
guest O
so O
that O
made O
my O
husband O
very O
happy O
and O
the O
food B-AS
was O
delicious O
, O
if O
I O
must O
recommend O
a O
dish B-AS
it O
must O
be O
the O
pumkin B-AS
tortelini I-AS
. O

They O
did O
n't O
give O
us O
the O
dinner B-AS
special I-AS
until O
we O
asked O
for O
it O
. O

You O
must O
have O
the O
crabmeat B-AS
lasagna I-AS
which O
is O
out O
of O
this O
world O
and O
the O
chocolate B-AS
bread I-AS
pudding I-AS
for O
dessert B-AS
. O

word O
of O
advice O
, O
save O
room O
for O
pasta B-AS
dishes I-AS
and O
never O
leave O
until O
you O
' O
ve O
had O
the O
tiramisu B-AS
. O

Very O
good O
service B-AS
and O
very O
good O
prices B-AS
. O

I O
recently O
went O
to O
this O
restaurant O
with O
some O
co O
- O
workers O
for O
lunch B-AS
and O
had O
an O
amazing O
time O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
impeccable O
and O
unobtrusive O
- O
the O
staff B-AS
knows O
what O
they O
are O
there O
to O
do O
- O
to O
know O
their O
menu B-AS
, O
present O
your O
meal B-AS
, O
and O
attend O
to O
your O
needs O
. O

Ess O
- O
A O
- O
Bagel O
either O
by O
Sty O
- O
town O
or O
midtown O
is O
by O
far O
the O
best O
bagel B-AS
in O
NY O
. O

Our O
food B-AS
was O
great O
too O
! O

Open O
late O
well O
as O
late O
as O
I O
ever O
got O
there O
and O
I O
' O
m O
a O
night O
person O

The O
most O
annoying O
thing O
, O
though O
, O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
servers B-AS
seem O
to O
be O
trained O
to O
drive O
revenue O
. O

Get O
your O
food B-AS
to O
go O
, O
find O
a O
bench O
, O
and O
kick O
back O
with O
a O
plate B-AS
of I-AS
dumplings I-AS
. O

Please O
try O
the O
Filet B-AS
Mignon I-AS
, O
its O
just O
the O
most O
tender O
piece O
ever O
. O

Everything O
we O
had O
was O
pretty O
good O
, O
but O
we O
have O
only O
been O
there O
once O
. O

We O
were O
still O
sitting O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
while O
we O
drank O
the O
sangria B-AS
, O
but O
facing O
away O
from O
the O
bar B-AS
when O
we O
turned O
back O
around O
, O
the O
$ O
2 O
was O
gone O
the O
people O
next O
to O
us O
said O
the O
bar B-AS
took O
it O
. O

Something O
about O
them O
being O
busy O
with O
holiday O
party O
's O
. O

The O
sake B-AS
menu I-AS
should O
not O
be O
overlooked O
! O

I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
. O

This O
place O
is O
great O
. O

the O
drinks B-AS
are O
amazing O
and O
half O
off O
till O
8 O
pm O
. O

i O
' O
ve O
been O
back O
to O
nha O
trang O
literally O
a O
hundred O
times O
for O
the O
beef B-AS
cubes I-AS
, O
they O
're O
that O
good O
. O

With O
so O
many O
poor O
experiences O
to O
be O
had O
in O
the O
theater O
district O
, O
is O
truly O
an O
excellent O
find O
! O

This O
has O
got O
to O
be O
one O
of O
the O
most O
overrated O
restaurants O
in O
Brooklyn O
. O

The O
service B-AS
, O
wine B-AS
selection I-AS
, O
ambiance B-AS
are O
all O
outstanding O
and O
deserve O
recognition O
. O

Went O
there O
last O
night O
for O
2 O
year O
anniversery O
, O
and O
was O
n't O
all O
that O
impressed O
. O

It O
was O
rather O
pathetic O
that O
it O
took O
them O
over O
an O
hour O
to O
seat O
us O
. O

We O
were O
seated O
promptly O
as O
we O
had O
reservations B-AS
, O
however O
after O
that O
the O
service B-AS
was O
slow O
. O

At O
first O
I O
was O
slightly O
skeptical O
because O
it O
was O
a O
sushi O
restaurant O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
NYC O
. O

It O
's O
really O
also O
the O
service B-AS
, O
is O
good O
and O
the O
waiters B-AS
are O
friendly O
. O

Suan O
was O
a O
recommendation O
that O
I O
am O
glad O
we O
heeded O
. O

The O
food O
was O
pretty O
good O
, O
but O
a O
little O
flavorless O
and O
the O
portions B-AS
very O
small O
, O
including O
dessert B-AS
. O

We O
visit O
at O
least O
once O
a O
month O
. O

It O
is O
set O
far O
from O
the O
small O
street O
it O
's O
on O
, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
traffic B-AS
noise I-AS
. O

Also O
, O
the O
place O
is O
popular O
with O
families O
, O
so O
if O
you O
're O
bothered O
by O
children O
running O
loose O
like O
wild O
animals O
, O
come O
later O
at O
night O
to O
avoid O
them O
. O

I O
'll O
keep O
this O
short O
. O

I O
felt O
as O
though O
I O
were O
eating O
in O
Paris O
. O

Lived O
in O
Shanghai O
most O
of O
my O
life O
and O
thought O
the O
food B-AS
was O
comparable O
to O
the O
flagship O
Green O
Bo O
restaurant O
there O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
Cafe O
St O
Bart O
's O
for O
their O
food B-AS
, O
the O
ambience B-AS
and O
wonderful O
service B-AS
. O

However O
, O
it O
's O
not O
worth O
a O
special O
trip O
. O

Nice O
value O
. O

Gigino O
's O
in O
Wagner O
Park O
is O
so O
enjoyable O
. O

And O
it O
was O
quick O
which O
is O
very O
important O
. O

This O
is O
a O
nice O
restaurant O
if O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
good O
place O
to O
host O
an O
intimate O
dinner B-AS
meeting I-AS
with O
business O
associates O
. O

All O
the O
NYU O
students O
love O
this O
place O
so O
it O
makes O
for O
a O
fun O
young O
atmosphere B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
here O
does O
a O
great O
service O
to O
the O
name O
Cantonese B-AS
that O
is O
. O

But O
, O
nothing O
stands O
out O
about O
the O
cooking B-AS
. O

Joya O
used O
to O
be O
a O
cool O
spot O
with O
decent O
food B-AS
and O
a O
colorful O
, O
if O
not O
relaxed O
, O
atmosphere B-AS
. O

If O
that O
's O
a O
problem O
, O
go O
to O
McDonald O
's O
and O
destroy O
your O
insides O
. O

The O
Prix B-AS
Fixe I-AS
menu I-AS
is O
worth O
every O
penny O
and O
you O
get O
more O
than O
enough O
both O
in O
quantity B-AS
AND O
quality B-AS
. O

I O
' O
ve O
been O
here O
3 O
times O
for O
lunch B-AS
and O
it O
is O
one O
of O
my O
favorites O
in O
the O
city O
. O

I O
had O
their O
eggs B-AS
benedict I-AS
for O
brunch B-AS
, O
which O
were O
the O
worst O
in O
my O
entire O
life O
, O
I O
tried O
removing O
the O
hollondaise B-AS
sauce I-AS
completely O
that O
was O
how O
failed O
it O
was O
. O

I O
work O
near O
- O
by O
, O
and O
they O
have O
the O
BEST O
oatmeal B-AS
in O
the O
neighborhood O
not O
a O
packaged O
or O
quick O
- O
cooked O
item O
. O

Always O
busy O
but O
fast O
moving O
. O

Too O
bad O
the O
food B-AS
was O
n't O
of O
the O
same O
heritage O
. O

The O
menu B-AS
looked O
good O
, O
except O
for O
offering O
the O
Chilean B-AS
Sea I-AS
Bass I-AS
, O
but O
the O
server B-AS
does O
not O
offer O
up O
the O
specials B-AS
that O
were O
written O
on O
the O
board O
outside O
. O

Sexy O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
really O
good O
, O
I O
had O
the O
onion B-AS
soup I-AS
and O
it O
was O
one O
of O
the O
best O
ever O
. O

I O
will O
have O
to O
say O
, O
this O
Bengali O
Fast O
Food O
joint O
is O
clearly O
my O
favorite O
. O

I O
' O
m O
not O
picky O
, O
but O
it O
was O
actually O
gross O
. O

overall O
, O
a O
solid O
restaurant O
and O
at O
less O
than O
$ O
40pp O
including O
wine B-AS
, O
a O
solid O
deal O
as O
well O
. O

Since O
it O
literally O
is O
a O
complete O
hole O
in O
the O
wall O
, O
it O
's O
a O
bit O
intimidating O
at O
first O
, O
but O
you O
get O
over O
that O
very O
quickly O
as O
soon O
as O
the O
friendly O
staff B-AS
welcomes O
you O
, O
do O
n't O
hesitate O
to O
ask O
for O
help O
with O
what O
to O
get O
. O

Based O
on O
the O
reviews O
for O
dinner B-AS
, O
this O
is O
a O
place O
I O
would O
reconsider O
revisiting O
for O
that O
, O
but O
definitely O
not O
for O
Dim B-AS
Sum I-AS
again O
. O

It O
costs O
$ O
2 O
extra O
to O
turn O
a O
regular O
roll B-AS
into O
an O
inside O
- O
out O
roll B-AS
, O
but O
the O
roll B-AS
more O
than O
triples O
in O
size O
, O
and O
that O
's O
not O
just O
from O
the O
rice B-AS
. O

Even O
with O
John O
's O
and O
Joe O
's O
around O
the O
corner O
, O
this O
place O
will O
make O
a O
name O
for O
itself O
. O

It O
melted O
in O
my O
little O
mouth O
and O
the O
perfect O
consistency O
- O
not O
too O
fishy O
, O
creamy O
, O
and O
slightly O
buttery O
. O

When O
he O
finally O
did O
, O
he O
was O
unable O
to O
make O
a O
gin B-AS
and I-AS
tonic I-AS
- O
could O
n't O
find O
tonic B-AS
. O

My O
girlfriend O
convinced O
me O
to O
go O
in O
the O
other O
night O
for O
a O
quick O
bite O
. O

The O
dim B-AS
sum I-AS
is O
ok O
but O
does O
n't O
taste O
that O
fresh O
, O
and O
the O
little B-AS
dishes I-AS
do O
n't O
look O
steamy O
hot O
as O
they O
should O
also O
note O
lack O
of O
Chinese O
here O
. O

despite O
the O
untasteful O
previous O
review O
. O

Do O
n't O
judge O
this O
place O
prima O
facie O
, O
you O
have O
to O
try O
it O
to O
believe O
it O
, O
a O
home O
away O
from O
home O
for O
the O
literate O
heart O
. O

Sure O
, O
everyone O
's O
got O
their O
favorite O
, O
but O
to O
know O
Sal O
, O
is O
to O
know O
New O
York O
. O

I O
think O
that O
it O
is O
absolutely O
brilliant O
and O
well O
runned O
business O
operation O
. O

Also O
they O
were O
$ O
15 O
each O
! O

The O
service B-AS
is O
ok O
, O
some O
of O
the O
people O
did O
n't O
get O
what O
they O
asked O
for O
. O

My O
friends O
spoke O
so O
much O
about O
it O
for O
months O
, O
I O
finally O
made O
the O
time O
to O
come O
down O
ear O
and O
dine O
in O
. O

If O
you O
want O
good O
authentic O
Thai B-AS
this O
place O
is O
not O
the O
place O
to O
go O
. O

I O
recommend O
getting O
a O
reservation B-AS
even O
though O
we O
saw O
people O
seated O
without O
one O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
moderately O
enjoyed O
was O
their O
Grilled B-AS
Chicken I-AS
special I-AS
with I-AS
Edamame I-AS
Puree I-AS
. O

This O
is O
as O
good O
as O
neighborhood O
restaurants O
come O
. O

If O
you O
want O
some O
roast B-AS
duck I-AS
, O
pork B-AS
or O
chicken B-AS
on I-AS
rice I-AS
with I-AS
ginger I-AS
, O
try O
them O
out O
! O

You O
order O
from O
a O
menu B-AS
, O
so O
you O
leave O
feeling O
like O
you O
missed O
the O
full O
experience O
. O

One O
of O
the O
more O
authentic O
Shanghainese O
restaurants O
in O
the O
US O
definitely O
the O
best O
in O
Manhattan O
Chinatown O
. O

We O
will O
go O
back O
every O
time O
we O
are O
in O
the O
City O
. O

we O
love O
th O
pink O
pony O
. O

So O
eat O
fast O
and O
order O
a O
lot O
. O

Staff B-AS
is O
very O
accomodating O
. O

I O
have O
to O
agree O
with O
the O
previous O
reviewer O
. O

-- O
Eat O
Club O
is O
a O
roving O
group O
of O
NYC O
gluttons O

If O
you O
were O
there O
when O
it O
first O
opened O
, O
give O
this O
restaurant O
a O
second O
chance O
. O

I O
went O
to O
Del O
Frisco O
's O
Friday O
night O
with O
my O
boyfriend O
for O
an O
8 O
, O
00 O
reservation B-AS
. O

If O
you O
like O
Sakagura O
but O
you O
feel O
it O
's O
too O
much O
, O
you O
'd O
better O
try O
Yokocho O
. O

yourself O
a O
favor O
and O
have O
dinner B-AS
here O
and O
see O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
agree O
with O
me O
. O

Definitely O
a O
great O
spot O
for O
a O
nice O
occasion O
or O
date O
. O

You O

like O
Cheers O
where O
everyone O
knows O
your O
name O
and O
they O
are O
ACTUALLY O
glad O
you O
came O
. O

Not O
pretentious O
and O
very O
economical O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
terrific O
and O
the O
service B-AS
classy O
, O
attentive O
, O
without O
being O
overbearing O
. O

This O
is O
an O
amazing O
place O
to O
try O
some O
roti B-AS
rolls I-AS
. O

Fresh O
ingredients B-AS
and O
everything O
is O
made O
to O
order O

We O
have O
never O
had O
any O
problems O
with O
charging O
the O
meal B-AS
or O
the O
tip B-AS
, O
and O
the O
food B-AS
was O
delivered O
quickly O
, O
but O
we O
live O
only O
a O
few O
minutes O
walk O
from O
them O
. O

Quick O
and O
friendly O
service B-AS
. O

Authentic O
bistro O
! O

They O
are O
tasty O
, O
but O
I O
suggest O
only O
eating O
one O
with O
meat B-AS
because O
they O
tend O
not O
to O
mesh O
that O
well O
with O
the O
average O
American O
digestive O
system O
. O

Somewhat O
pricey O
but O
what O
the O
heck O
. O

It O
's O
true O
, O
this O
place O
is O
not O
cheap O
. O

Try O
the O
hot B-AS
dogs I-AS
too O
, O
they O
're O
snappy O
and O
delicious O
. O

Delivery B-AS
is O
fast O
too O
. O

Being O
from O
the O
south O
, O
there O
are O
n't O
any O
good O
delis O
in O
my O
area O
and O
while O
watching O
Foods O
across O
America O
on O
PBS O
I O
found O
out O
about O
Katz O
's O
Deli O
. O

The O
noise B-AS
level I-AS
was O
unbearable O
, O
conversation O
impossible O
. O

Personal B-AS
pans I-AS
are O
the O
perfect O
size O
for O
those O
hungry O
nights O
. O

Highly O
recommended O
is O
the O
Spicy B-AS
Fried I-AS
Clam I-AS

One O
of O
the O
earlier O
people O
commenting O
on O
the O
restaurant O
did O
not O
get O
the O
that O
some O
experimenting O
is O
going O
on O
with O
the O
menu B-AS
in O
a O
positive O
way O
. O

It O
's O
convenient O
. O

Thanks O
Bloom O
's O
for O
a O
lovely O
trip O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
great O
if O
your O
looking O
for O
a O
laid O
back O
scene O
and O
an O
inexpensive O
way O
to O
spend O
a O
weekend O
afternoon O
. O

Oh O
right O
, O
I O
should O
probably O
say O
something O
nice O
. O

Odd O
for O
Ave O
B O
, O
not O
just O
odd O
, O
The O
place B-AS
attracts O
an O
eclectic O
crowd O
to O
say O
the O
least O
. O

When O
we O
stumbled O
on O
Leon O
, O
we O
thought O
that O
we O
had O
found O
quite O
the O
gem O
BUT O
, O
we O
were O
certainly O
wrong O
. O

Instead O
of O
wasting O

just O
got O
back O
from O
lunch B-AS
at O
Tamarind O
and O
it O
was O
excellent O
. O

head O

above O

in O
food B-AS
quality I-AS
, O
to O
the O
much O
overpraised O
and O
underdeserving O
baluchi O

. O

The O
man B-AS
that O
was O
hosting O
promised O
to O
save O
a O
table B-AS
for O
our O
party O
of O
7 O
, O
then O
sat O
a O
party O
of O
2 O
at O
the O
very O
table B-AS
he O
was O
saving O

while O
there O
were O

Try O
the O
cheesecake B-AS
! O

As O
we O
were O
sitting O
eating O
the O
subpar O
food B-AS
the O
manager B-AS
proceeded O
to O
berate O
a O
couple O
of O
his O
employees B-AS
for O
putting O
out O
the O
wrong O
containers B-AS
for I-AS
condiments I-AS
and O
explained O
to O
them O
how O
expensive O
these O
containers B-AS
were O

Perhaps O
. O

Great O
Indian B-AS
food I-AS
and O
the O
service B-AS
is O
incredible O
. O

Go O
here O
. O

If O
you O
are O
in O
the O
area O
try O
The O
Bagel O
Shoppe O
on O
74th O
street O
which O
is O
3 O
blocks O
away O
on O
2nd O
Ave O
. O

Rosario O
's O
is O
without O
a O
doubt O
one O
of O
the O
greatest O
pizzerias O
in O
existence O
. O

Decor B-AS
is O
nice O
and O
minimalist O
, O
food B-AS
simple O
yet O
very O
well O
presented O
and O
cooked O
, O
and O
the O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
matches O
the O
food B-AS
very O
well O
. O

I O
had O
the O
salmon O
dish O
and O
while O
it O
was O
fine O
, O
for O
the O
price B-AS
paid O
, O
I O
expected O
it O
to O
have O
some O
type O
of O
flavor B-AS
. O

We O
ordered O
a O
tuna B-AS
melt I-AS
, O
it O
came O
with O
out O
cheese B-AS
which O
just O
made O
it O
a O
tuna B-AS
sandwich I-AS
. O

Especially O
liked O
chicken B-AS
tikka I-AS
and O
the O
naan B-AS
, O
and O
the O
dals B-AS
. O

The O
waiters B-AS
were O
not O
attentive O
except O
that O
the O
bill B-AS
turned O
up O
on O
the O
table O
before O
we O
were O
finished O
. O

The O
restaurant O
looks O
out O
over O
beautiful O
green O
lawns B-AS
to O
the O
Hudson O
River O
and O
the O
Statue O
of O
Liberty O
. O

My O
wife O
and O
I O
always O
enjoy O
the O
young O
, O
not O
always O
well O
trained O
but O
nevertheless O
friendly O
, O
staff O
, O
all O
of O
whom O
have O
a O
story O
. O

We O
generally O
like O
good O
restaurants O
and O
eat O
out O
often O
but O
Kai O
was O
way O
to O
expensive O
for O
what O
we O
got O
. O

What O
a O
great O
place O
. O

The O
sangria B-AS
was O
pretty O
tasty O
and O
good O
on O
a O
hot O
muggy O
day O
. O

Do O
n't O
eat O
here O
unless O
you O
're O
starving O
for O
thai B-AS
food I-AS
and O
you O
work O
next O
door O
. O

This O
tiny O
Williamsburg O
spot O
is O
always O
pleasantly O
surprising O
. O

For O
the O
people O
who O
want O
great O
food B-AS
plus O
great O
service B-AS
, O
Roxy O
is O
a O
place O
to O
AVOID O
! O

I O
had O
the O
best O
ravioli B-AS
ever O
. O

While O
the O
menu O
is O
n't O
especially O
groundbreaking O
, O
everything O
I O
' O
ve O
tried O
so O
far O
has O
been O
well O
- O
executed O
and O
tasty O
. O

I O
ve O
been O
here O
a O
bunch O
of O
times O
now O
and O
the O
service B-AS
is O
always O
outstanding O
. O

The O
bill B-AS
is O
approximately O
$ O
25 O
for O
2 O
at O
lunch B-AS
without O
drinks B-AS
. O

Quite O
frankly O
, O
this O
is O
some O
of O
the O
worst O
sushi B-AS
I O
have O
ever O
tried O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
great O
, O
service B-AS
is O
ok O
. O

The O
overall O
price B-AS
tag I-AS
was O
very O
very O
expensive O
, O
something O
I O
did O
expect O
. O

By O
the O
time O
we O
were O
done O
, O
it O
was O
past O
1 O
, O
00am O
. O

Spice O
is O
great O
Thai B-AS
food I-AS
, O
love O
the O
inexpensive O
appetizers B-AS
. O

Read O
all O
the O
other O
review O
, O
they O
'll O
confirm O
it O
. O

Even O
after O
they O
overcharged O
me O
the O
last O
time O
I O
was O
there O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
attentive O
. O

He O
not O
only O
makes O
his O
own O
homemade O
mozzarella B-AS
, O
but O
every O
pie B-AS
is O
ultra O
fresh O
. O

Fish B-AS
was O
overdone O
. O

Great O
idea O
and O
base O
for O
restaurant O
, O
but O
work O
on O
the O
details O
, O
people O
who O
think O
this O
was O
good O
need O
to O
go O
back O
to O
the O
shore O
towns O
and O
rethink O
what O
it O
should O
have O
tasted O
like O
. O

When O
you O
're O
sitting O
in O
their O
main B-AS
dining I-AS
room I-AS
which O
has O
a O
spectacular O
, O
hand O
- O
painted O
high O
ceiling B-AS
you O
'd O
never O
know O
there O
was O
a O
world O
outside O
. O

We O
visited O
Bread O
Bar O
during O
January O
restaurant O
week O
and O
were O
so O
pleased O
with O
the O
menu B-AS
selections I-AS
and O
service B-AS
. O

I O
have O
been O
twice O
to O
this O
restaurant O
. O

also O
make O
sure O
you O
pay O
attention O
to O
the O
music B-AS
being O
piped O
in O
, O
quite O
a O
weird O
selection O
. O

You O
could O
get O
a O
much O
better O
dining O
experience O
for O
the O
same O
amount O
of O
money O
in O
a O
lot O
of O
other O
French O
Bistros O
. O

The O
establishment B-AS
scores O
big O
points O
in O
presentation O
and O
style O
. O

The O
rest O
of O
the O
dim O
sum O
, O
though O
pricey O
by O
Chinatown O
standards O
, O
is O
worth O
it O
. O

Good O
food B-AS
. O

The O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
is O
very O
friendly O
, O
if O
not O
overly O
efficient O
. O

Surprisingly O
nothing O
could O
be O
further O
from O
the O
truth O
. O

The O
dim B-AS
sum I-AS
however O
was O
very O
good O
. O

It O
's O
better O
than O
being O
on O
the O
roof O
of O
Sutton O
Place O
with O
19 O
year O
old O
interns O
jabbing O
you O
in O
the O
ribs O
all O
night O
. O

Service B-AS
has O
always O
been O
friendly O
and O
efficient O
. O

Went O
there O
and O
had O
a O
combination O
of O
different O
seafood B-AS
dishes I-AS
and O
appetizers B-AS
. O

Its O
a O
great O
place O
for O
a O
casual O
date O
or O
to O
entertain O
clients O
for O
lunch B-AS
. O

All O
we O
received O
was O
an O
apology O
as O
we O
left O
to O
see O
our O
show O
without O
dinner B-AS
. O

The O
table O
next O
to O
us O
asked O
if O
he O
crushed O
the O
grapes B-AS
himself O
when O
their O
long O
overdue O
bottle B-AS
of I-AS
wine I-AS
finally O
arrived O
. O

Prices B-AS
are O
very O
good O
. O

We O
could O
not O
catch O
our O
waiter B-AS
's O
eye O
, O
and O
he O
ignored O
us O
. O

Fantastic O
place O
. O

Plain O
and O
simple O
it O
's O
bad O
thai B-AS
food I-AS
. O

Definitely O
not O
a O
restaurant O
to O
skip O
! O

They O
refuse O
to O
seat O
parties O
of O
3 O
or O
more O
on O
weekends O
. O

Usually O
3 O
vs O
4 O
items O
per O
dish B-AS
. O

While O
certain O
staples B-AS
are O
excellent O
the O
burger B-AS
, O
some O
of O
the O
pastas B-AS
, O
the O
food B-AS
is O
not O
really O
the O
point O
. O

The O
Dim B-AS
Sum I-AS
was O
so O
- O
so O
, O
but O
not O
spectacular O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
so O
- O
so O
. O

The O
waitress B-AS
, O
seems O
to O
be O
more O
concerned O
of O
looking O
good O
than O
actually O
waitress B-AS
. O

The O
place B-AS
is O
larger O
than O
most O
and O
features O
adequate O
seating B-AS
unlike O
most O
joints O
, O
and O
has O
a O
bar B-AS
which O
deserves O
a O
mention O
. O

What O
a O
ripoff O
! O

Threw O
my O
fiance O
's O
surprise O
30th O
birthday O
dinner B-AS
here O
could O
n't O
be O
happier O
. O

You O
can O
do O
it O
here O
. O

Food B-AS
. O

good O
music B-AS
, O
great O
food B-AS
, O
speedy O
service B-AS
affordable O
prices B-AS
. O

There O
was O
a O
small O
wait O
, O
but O
shorter O
than O
I O
expected O
. O

The O
lobster O
sandwich O
is O
$ O
24 O
and O
although O
it O
was O
good O
it O
was O
not O
nearly O
enough O
to O
warrant O
that O
price B-AS
. O

May O
, O
the O
owner B-AS
always O
has O
a O
smile O
on O
her O
and O
will O
warmly O
greet O
you O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
lived O
in O
NY O
for O
5 O
years O
and O
this O
place O
has O
it O
all O
. O

I O
just O
read O
Mocaramel O
's O
review O
and O
felt O
compelled O
to O
respond O
. O

The O
sides B-AS
were O
ok O
and O
incredibly O
salty O
. O

It O
hits O
the O
spot O
every O
time O

For O
some O
reason O
, O
all O
the O
seafood B-AS
on O
the O
menu B-AS
was O
unavailable O
except O
for O
the O
Salmon B-AS
. O

Not O
a O
large O
place O
, O
but O
it O
's O
cute O
and O
cozy O
. O

Do O
n't O
be O
fooled O
by O
crowds O
of O
people O
. O

and O
there O
's O
no O
way O
out O
. O

The O
beverages B-AS
were O
excellent O
, O
and O
the O
dessert B-AS
was O
good O
. O

The O
hostess B-AS
and O
the O
waitress B-AS
were O
incredibly O
rude O
and O
did O
everything O
they O
could O
to O
rush O
us O
out O
. O

Next O
time O
, O
we O
would O
n't O
dare O
ordering O
anything O
else O
other O
than O
some O
simple O
Asian B-AS
appetizers I-AS
and O
drinks B-AS
. O

Please O
if O
your O
thinking O
about O
it O
go O
, O
and O
stay O
the O
wait B-AS
you O
wo O
n't O
be O
disappointed O
. O

I O
must O
say O
the O
view B-AS
of O
NYC O
is O
so O
beautiful O
! O

If O
you O
'd O
like O
to O
have O
a O
nice O
light O
meal B-AS
with O
an O
asian O
accent O
, O
Long O
Tan O
is O
a O
good O
place O
on O
the O
slope O
. O

When O
going O
out O
for O
a O
nice O
dinner B-AS
, O
I O
like O
a O
nice O
ambiance B-AS
as O
well O
as O
very O
good O
food B-AS
. O

For O
all O
you O
lazy O
folks O
that O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
come O
to O
Alphabet O
City O
, O
I O
say O
, O
good O
, O
stay O
out O
. O

Otherwise O
, O
this O
place O
has O
great O
service B-AS
and O
prices B-AS
and O
a O
nice O
friendly O
atmosphere B-AS
. O

Highly O
recommend O
this O
as O
great O
value B-AS
for O
excellent O
sushi B-AS
and O
service B-AS
. O

This O
place O
would O
be O
so O
much O
better O
served B-AS
by O
being O
run O
by O
a O
group O
that O
actually O
understands O
customer O
service B-AS
. O

A++ O
The O
service B-AS
was O
good O
to O
excellent O
along O
with O
the O
attitude B-AS
. O

This O
is O
my O
fourth O
try O
over O
a O
two O
year O
period O
, O
and O
I O
' O
m O
done O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
awesome O
, O
definitely O
try O
the O
striped B-AS
bass I-AS
. O

The O
music O
does O
get O
a O
little O
loud O
at O
times O
, O
but O
it O
just O
made O
me O
want O
to O
lean O
closer O
to O
my O
beautiful O
wife O
, O
and O
as O
I O
did O
, O
I O
got O
a O
whiff O
of O
corriander B-AS
. O

black B-AS
white I-AS
shakes I-AS
came O
out O
good O
also O
. O

It O
's O
simply O
the O
best O
meal B-AS
in O
NYC O
. O

Probably O
would O
not O
go O
again O
. O

After O
passing O
by O
this O
restaurant O
for O
sometime O
I O
finally O
decided O
to O
go O
in O
and O
have O
dinner B-AS
. O

The O
seating B-AS
was O
if O
they O
were O
trying O
to O
get O
the O
maximum O
amount O
of O
people O
into O
the O
restaurant O
, O
so O
be O
nice O
to O
your O
neighbor O
when O
you O
dine O
here O
. O

I O
ordered O
the O
chu B-AS
chu I-AS
curry I-AS
and O
my O
friend O
ordered O
the O
pad B-AS
thai I-AS
chicken I-AS
. O

We O
go O
on O
Mondays O
for O
the O
prix B-AS
fixe I-AS
and O
our O
experience O
with O
the O
food B-AS
has O
been O
comparable O
to O
Blue O
Ribbon O
. O

Tuk O
Tuk O
is O
my O
second O
favorite O
neighborhood O
Thai O
place O
the O
first O
being O
Joya O
. O

However O
, O
they O
' O
ve O
got O
the O
most O
amazing O
pastrami B-AS
and O
the O
soups B-AS
hit O
the O
spot O
. O

Great O
bagels B-AS
made O
the O
old O
- O
fashioned O
way O
. O

This O
is O
some O
really O
good O
, O
inexpensive O
sushi B-AS
. O

my O
personal O
favorite O
is O
an O
everything O
bagel B-AS
with I-AS
lox I-AS
spread I-AS
, O
but O
all O
the O
bagles B-AS
are O
unbeliavably O
good O
. O

I O
would O
n't O
even O
have O
complained O
at O
all O
if O
the O
food B-AS
at O
least O
tasted O
good O
but O
the O
quality O
of O
food B-AS
was O
crappy O
, O
too O
. O

For O
the O
next O
hour O
and O
a O
half O
we O
stood O
in O
the O
crowded O
lobby B-AS
area I-AS
of O
this O
touristy O
restaurant O
listening O
to O
all O
types O
of O
explanations O
of O
why O
we O
were O
not O
being O
seated B-AS
. O

The O
pizza B-AS
is O
delicious O
and O
the O
proprietor B-AS
is O
one O
of O
the O
nicest O
in O
NYC O
. O

Also O
good O
for O
client O
lunch B-AS
meetings I-AS
, O
esp O
. O

For O
$ O
600 O
the O
most O
we O
have O
ever O
paid O
not O
even O
waving O
a O
magic O
wand O
will O
ever O
get O
us O
back O
for O
a O
repeat O
performance O
. O

The O
decor B-AS
is O
dark O
, O
cool O
and O
soothing O
, O
while O
the O
food B-AS
's I-AS
presentation I-AS
is O
spectacular O
, O
considering O
the O
low O
prices B-AS
. O

The O
Waitstaff B-AS
were O
very O
nice O
and O
suggested O
swordfish B-AS
for O
my O
husband O
he O
enjoyed O
his O
meal B-AS
. O

The O
setting B-AS
is O
casual O
and O
romantic O
. O

IT O
WAS O
HORRIBLE O
. O

Terrible O
, O
terrible O
management B-AS
, O
deserves O
to O
be O
shut O
- O
down O
. O

Great O
friendly O
service B-AS
, O
Fast O
seating B-AS
, O
Fast O
Delivery B-AS
, O
Excellent O
sushi B-AS
. O

The O
desserts B-AS
are O
more O
appealing O
then O
stuffy O
overpriced O
French O
restaurants O
. O

The O
Italian B-AS
food I-AS
has O
flavor O
that O
can O
be O
sort O
of O
surprising O
on O
the O
UES O
, O
and O
the O
service O
turns O
from O
a O
nightmare O
to O
attentive O
, O
they O
sort O
of O
remind O
me O
of O
the O
NY O
Yankees O
of O
the O
late O
90 O
's O
, O
no O
matter O
how O
bad O
it O
look O
, O
you O
knew O
that O
there O
was O
a O
rally O
just O
around O
the O
corner O
. O

As O
many O
other O
reviewers O
noticed O
, O
your O
order O
is O
often O
slow O
to O
arrive O
, O
this O
is O
particularly O
true O
in O
the O
evening O
but O
is O
not O
a O
problem O
during O
lunch O
time O
. O

I O
found O
the O
food B-AS
to O
be O
outstanding O
, O
particulary O
the O
salmon B-AS
dish I-AS
I O
had O
. O

Mizu O
is O
home O
to O
creative O
and O
unique O
rolls B-AS
not O
to O
found O
anywhere O
else O
. O

The O
New O
York O
Times O
has O
reviewed O
this O
place O
three O
times O
already O
, O
you O
know O
it O
's O
going O
to O
be O
good O
. O

Baluchi O
's O
has O
solid O
food B-AS
and O
a O
nice O
decor B-AS
at O
reasonable O
prices B-AS
. O

Emilio O
, O
the O
owner B-AS
, O
is O
often O
sitting O
in O
the O
front O
table O
greeting O
guests O
as O
they O
come O
and O
go O
. O

I O
have O
been O
to O
spice O
three O
times O
twice O
during O
lunch B-AS
and O
once O
at O
dinner B-AS
. O

Moules B-AS
were O
excellent O
, O
lobster B-AS
ravioli I-AS
was O
VERY O
salty O
! O

I O
came O
to O
this O
restaurant O
expecting O
to O
be O
surprised O
but O
left O
bored O
and O
overcharged O
. O

A O
cheap O
eat B-AS
for O
NYC O
, O
but O
not O
for O
dosa B-AS
. O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
noisy O
and O
the O
waiters O
are O
literally O
walking O
around O
doing O
things O
as O
fast O
as O
they O
can O
. O

The O
seafood B-AS
is O
amazing O
, O
there O
's O
a O
good O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
, O
and O
the O
ever O
- O
changing O
menu B-AS
always O
offers O
some O
great O
surprises O
. O

i O
do O
n't O
usually O
order O
wine B-AS
with O
indian B-AS
so O
i O
ca O
n't O
comment O
on O
their O
wine B-AS
list O
or O
their O
wine B-AS
. O

Pastrami B-AS
or I-AS
corned I-AS
beef I-AS
are O
juicy O
and O
piled O
high O
ask O
for O
extra O
rye B-AS
bread I-AS
. O

$ O
200 O
for O
2 O
glasses B-AS
of I-AS
champagne I-AS
, O
not O
too O
expensive O
bottle B-AS
of I-AS
wine I-AS
and O
2 O
after B-AS
dinner I-AS
drinks I-AS
. O

Really O
though O
, O
where O
's O
the O
seasoning B-AS
? O

The O
food B-AS
was O
just O
OK O
, O
at O
least O
for O
what O
food B-AS
was O
available O
. O

by O
dinner O
time O
, O
they O
turn O
it O
around O
and O
mount O
a O
huge O
comeback O
! O
! O

The O
waitress B-AS
was O
very O
patient O
with O
us O
and O
the O
food B-AS
is O
phenomenal O
! O

The O
ambience B-AS
was O
nice O
, O
but O
service B-AS
was O
n't O
so O
great O
. O

Solid O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
, O
knowledgeable O
staff B-AS
, O
friendly O
owners B-AS
and O
an O
adventurous O
, O
ever O
- O
changing O
menu B-AS
keep O
us O
coming O
back O
. O

The O
people B-AS
that O
work O
there O
are O
always O
so O
friendly O
you O
forget O
you O
are O
in O
New O
York O
sometimes O
. O

We O
did O
n't O
even O
see O
a O
menu B-AS
, O
as O
our O
waiter B-AS
described O
both O
the O
specials B-AS
and O
the O
main B-AS
dishes I-AS
. O

The O
location B-AS
and O
ambience B-AS
is O
Ok O
but O
the O
food B-AS
is O
what O
makes O
up O
for O
it O
. O

otherwise O
, O
good O
stuff B-AS
for O
late O
nite O
eats B-AS
. O

The O
dinner B-AS
was O
ok O
, O
nothing O
I O
would O
have O
again O
. O

It O
is O
thick O
and O
slightly O
soggy O
. O

Its O
not O
the O
same O
if O
you O
have O
to O
sit O
inside O
. O

I O
love O
and O
I O
know O
gourmet B-AS
food I-AS
by O
excellence O
! O

I O
plan O
to O
come O
here O
again O
and O
look O
forward O
to O
trying O
their O
assortment O
of O
bruschetta B-AS
, O
panini B-AS
's O
. O

Great O
people O
watching O
as O
others O
do O
the O
same O
to O
you O
. O

Maybe O
it O
was O
just O
an O
unintentional O
mistake O
but O
I O
' O
ve O
experienced O
the O
same O
with O
other O
restaurants O
so O
I O
do O
n't O
appreciate O
such O
practice O
. O

Two O
people O
in O
our O
party O
felt O
like O
something O
else O
, O
and O
Volare O
immediately O
obliged O
with O
two O
great O
dishes B-AS
that O
were O
not O
in O
their O
regular O
menu B-AS
. O

He O
offers O
subpar O
service B-AS
and O
has O
no O
personality O
. O

The O
waitress B-AS
remembers O
me O
and O
is O
very O
friendly O
, O
she O
knows O
what O
my O
regular O
is O
and O
that O
's O
the O
fried B-AS
mini I-AS
buns I-AS
with I-AS
the I-AS
condensed I-AS
milk I-AS
and I-AS
the I-AS
assorted I-AS
fruits I-AS
on I-AS
beancurd I-AS
. O

I O
' O
m O
going O
back O
. O

Diner O
food B-AS
at O
bistro O
prices B-AS
is O
a O
bummer O
. O

My O
friends O
and O
I O
have O
been O
going O
here O
regularly O
for O
two O
years O
. O

wow O
! O
how O
have O
i O
missed O
this O
one O
, O
tried O
Long O
Tan O
last O
week O
for O
the O
first O
time O
and O
now O
know O
what O
the O
NY O
TIMES O
and O
many O
more O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
already O
knew O
. O

Go O
there O
on O
an O
empty O
stomach O
and O
leave O
feeling O
like O
a O
baby O
Veal O
Calfok O
bad O
joke O
, O
but O
you O
will O
see O
. O

While O
we O
thoroughly O
enjoyed O
the O
food B-AS
, O
it O
was O
annoying O
to O
scream O
across O
the O
table O
for O
conversation O
. O

Me O
and O
my O
girls O
will O
definitely O
go O
back O
. O

The O
first O
time O
the O
sushi O
was O
outstanding O
, O
the O
second O
time O
it O
was O
a O
little O
bland O
. O

The O
portions B-AS
are O
large O
and O
the O
servers B-AS
always O
surprise O
us O
with O
a O
different O
starter B-AS
. O

delicious O
bagels B-AS
, O
especially O
when O
right O
out O
of O
the O
oven O
. O

I O
ve O
passed O
by O
the O
spot O
tons O
of O
times O
always O
wanting O
to O
go O
in O
. O

All O
the O
food B-AS
was O
hot O
tasty O
. O

Have O
been O
several O
times O
and O
it O
never O
dissapoints O
. O

This O
is O
one O
great O
place O
to O
eat O
pizza B-AS
more O
out O
but O
not O
a O
good O
place O
for O
take O
- O
out O
pizza B-AS
. O

Our O
server B-AS
was O
very O
helpful O
and O
friendly O
. O

Try O
green B-AS
curry I-AS
with I-AS
vegetables I-AS
. O

Would O
recommend O
this O
place O
as O
a O
good O
date O
spot O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
drop O
a O
ton O
of O
cash O
. O

While O
I O
' O
m O
not O
sure O
that O
this O
happens O
all O
the O
time O
- O
this O
is O
the O
kind O
of O
treatment O
that O
buys O
repeat O
business O
! O

This O
place O
was O
not O
ALL O
THAT O
! O

First O
of O
all O
, O
this O
place B-AS
is O
* O
not O
* O
romantic O
, O
as O
claimed O
by O
Citysearch O
's O
editorial O
review O
. O

The O
second O
you O
walk O
through O
the O
heavy O
vault O
like O
door B-AS
, O
with O
people O
anticipating O
your O
arrival O
you O
get O
the O
sense O
that O
you O
are O
going O
to O
have O
the O
dining O
ride O
of O
a O
lifetime O
. O

Much O
more O
reasonably O
priced B-AS
too O
! O

If O
you O
venture O
off O
the O
island O
of O
Manhattan O
and O
ca O
n't O
seem O
to O
find O
a O
great O
Italian O
restaurant O
, O
drive O
to O
Corona O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
not O
very O
tasty O
, O
the O
portioins B-AS
were O
tiny O
even O
for O
such O
a O
high O
quality O
restaurant O
. O

My O
friend O
from O
Milan O
and O
myself O
were O
pleasantly O
surprised O
when O
we O
arrived O
and O
everyone O
spoke O
italian O
. O

Others O
have O
to O
go O
to O
other O
restaurants O
and O
feel O
sad O
until O
they O
're O
eaten O
. O

Why O
make O
a O
reservation B-AS
if O
you O
are O
n't O
going O
to O
keep O
it O
? O

The O
Pad B-AS
Thai I-AS
is O
excellent O
here O
, O
as O
well O
. O

Big O
and O
gawky O
on O
the O
outside O
. O

I O
have O
been O
to O
Mary O
's O
many O
times O
and O
I O
like O
it O
. O

Searching O
to O
get O
out O
from O
the O
cold O
, O
freezing O
weather O
, O
we O
went O
into O
what O
we O
thought O
was O
a O
deli O
. O

I O
do O
not O
recommend O
lunch B-AS
specials I-AS
just O
because O
it O
tasts O
the O
same O
with O
other O
regular O
chinese O
restaurant O
. O

HIGHLY O
RECOMMENDED O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O

This O
is O
the O
best O
thing O
in O
Soho O
. O

Went O
here O
last O
night O
and O
had O
a O
pleasant O
experience O
. O

We O
parked O
on O
the O
block O
of O
Nina O
's O
the O
place B-AS
looked O
nice O
, O
with O
people O
obviously O
enjoying O
their O
pizzas B-AS
. O

I O
came O
here O
with O
my O
boyfriend O
for O
our O
anniversary O
because O
it O
was O
highly O
recommended O
to O
him O
by O
a O
friend O
. O

For O
$ O
760 O
for O
2 O
people O
, O
it O
's O
a O
once O
in O
a O
lifetime O
experience O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
ok O
, O
but O
not O
any O
better O
than O
what O
you O
get O
at O
a O
good O
neighborhood O
restaurant O
. O

We O
had O
the O
pot B-AS
- I-AS
stickers I-AS
which O
were O
great O
and O
a O
tempura B-AS
dish I-AS
that O
was O
great O
. O

I O
think O
the O
stuff B-AS
was O
better O
than O
Disney O
. O

After O
reading O
the O
good O
reviews O
of O
this O
restaurant O
, O
I O
decided O
to O
give O
it O
a O
try O
with O
two O
friends O
. O

While O
the O
$ O
20 O
entree B-AS
range I-AS
is O
not O
overly O
expensive O
, O
in O
New O
York O
City O
, O
there O
is O
definitely O
better O
food B-AS
in O
that O
range O
, O
and O
so O
Sapphire O
, O
despite O
it O
's O
lovely O
atmosphere B-AS
, O
will O
most O
likely O
not O
be O
a O
restaurant O
to O
which O
I O
will O
return O
. O

Orsay O
, O
is O
without O
a O
doubt O
one O
of O
the O
best O
values O
for O
authentic O
French B-AS
food I-AS
in O
NYC O
. O

I O
had O
been O
searching O
really O
hard O
for O
a O
restaurant O
in O
New O
York O
where O
I O
could O
really O
feel O
unwanted O
and O
ignored O
and O
I O
finally O
found O
it O
! O

It O
's O
definately O
not O
a O
place O
to O
go O
if O
you O
want O
to O
impress O
someone O
. O

Well O
, O
their O
deliveries B-AS
take O
for O
ever O
and O
the O
food B-AS
is O
usually O
cold O
. O

The O
staff B-AS
is O
no O
nonsense O
. O

Chinese O
Desserts O
are O
known O
for O
healthful O
benefits O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
sweetness O
. O

Wonderful O
at O
holiday O
time O
. O

And O
really O
large O
portions B-AS
. O

The O
place O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
fun O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
Thai O
restaurant O
with O
a O
very O
friendly O
staff B-AS
. O

Have O
eaten O
at O
Ginger O
House O
several O
times O
, O
and O
it O
's O
always O
good O
. O

I O
ordered O
the O
smoked B-AS
salmon I-AS
and I-AS
roe I-AS
appetizer I-AS
and O
it O
was O
off O
flavor O
. O

We O
went O
here O
for O
lunch B-AS
a O
couple O
of O
weeks O
ago O
on O
a O
Saturday O
, O
and O
I O
was O
thoroughly O
impressed O
with O
the O
food B-AS
. O

I O
recommend O
the O
garlic B-AS
shrimp I-AS
, O
okra B-AS
( I-AS
bindi I-AS
) I-AS
, O
and O
anything O
with O
lamb B-AS
. O

As O
a O
Japanese O
native O
, O
I O
' O
ve O
lived O
in O
the O
Tristate O
area O
for O
over O
8 O
years O
, O
but O
I O
was O
just O
so O
amazed O
at O
this O
place O
. O

To O
give O
you O
an O
idea O
of O
how O
good O
we O
thought O
it O
was O
, O
we O
ended O
up O
going O
to O
Ping O
's O
three O
weekends O
in O
a O
row O
! O
! O
! O

As O
we O
were O
leaving O
, O
the O
couple O
standing O
by O
the O
door O
said O
to O
another O
waiter B-AS
, O
we O
're O
not O
in O
a O
hurry O
. O

The O
menu B-AS
was O
impressive O
with O
selections O
ranging O
from O
a O
burger B-AS
, O
to O
steak B-AS
, O
to O
escargot B-AS
. O

In O
fact O
, O
two O
people O
could O
really O
share O
one O
plate B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
great O
and O
authentic O
. O

This O
was O
a O
repeat O
visit O
and O
we O
'll O
definitely O
be O
back O
again O
. O

during O
happy O
hour O
! O

Good O
for O
casual B-AS
dinner I-AS
with O
jeans O
and O
sneakers O
. O

Love O
YUKA O
. O

Anyway O
, O
the O
food B-AS
is O
good O
, O
the O
price B-AS
is O
right O
and O
they O
have O
a O
decent O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
. O

Go O
, O
go O
, O
hurry O
, O
before O
everyone O
finds O
out O
about O
it O
. O

Prices B-AS
are O
higher O
to O
dine O
in O
and O
their O
chicken B-AS
tikka I-AS
marsala I-AS
is O
quite O
good O
. O

I O
am O
bringing O
my O
whole O
family O
back O
next O
time O
. O

This O
place O
has O
many O
different O
styles B-AS
of I-AS
pizza I-AS
and O
they O
are O
all O
amazing O
. O

The O
photos O
of O
the O
restaurant O
in O
its O
web O
site O
are O
way O
better O
than O
the O
real O
look B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
lousy O
, O
too O
sweet O
or O
too O
salty O
and O
the O
portions B-AS
tiny O
. O

But O
the O
coconut B-AS
rice I-AS
was O
good O
. O

It O
took O
them O
25 O
minutes O
to O
bring O
our O
appetizer B-AS
. O

A O
guaranteeed O
delight O
! O

I O
have O
been O
coming O
to O
this O
neighborhood O
spot O
for O
years O
. O

Overall O
I O
would O
recommend O
it O
and O
go O
back O
again O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
great O
. O

Pair O
you O
food B-AS
with O
the O
excellent O
beers B-AS
on I-AS
tap I-AS
or O
their O
well O
priced B-AS
wine I-AS
list I-AS
. O

If O
you O
like O
your O
music B-AS
blasted O
and O
the O
system O
is O
nt O
that O
great O
and O
if O
you O
want O
to O
pay O
at O
least O
100 O
dollar O
bottle B-AS
minimun I-AS
then O
you O
'll O
love O
it O
here O
. O

All O
of O
my O
co O
- O
workers O
stated O
that O
the O
food B-AS
was O
amazing O
and O
wondered O
why O
they O
had O
n't O
heard O
about O
this O
place O
. O

Anyway O
, O
this O
is O
the O
last O
time O
I O
cross O
the O
williamsburg O
. O

Metrazur O
has O
a O
beautiful O
spot B-AS
overlooking O
the O
main O
terminal O
. O

Friendly O
staff B-AS
that O
actually O
lets O
you O
enjoy O
your O
meal B-AS
and O
the O
company O
you O
're O
with O
. O

When O
I O
' O
m O
feeling O
stressed O
by O
the O
noise O
and O
congestion O
around O
my O
office O
, O
I O
head O
for O
Cafe O
St O
Bart O
's O
. O

Guess O
the O
555Soul O
ads O
did O
n't O
launch O
her O
big O
modeling O
career O
. O

The O
restaurant O
is O
rather O
small O
but O
we O
were O
lucky O
to O
get O
a O
table B-AS
quickly O
. O

Besides O
, O
we O
were O
on O
vacation O
! O

I O
love O
this O
cozy O
around O
the O
way O
Rest O
. O

Quality B-AS
of I-AS
food I-AS
is O
excellent O
and O
price B-AS
is O
cheap O
, O
stick O
to O
pork B-AS
, O
fish B-AS
, O
chicken B-AS
, O
lamb B-AS
and O
vegetables B-AS
. O

Do O
n't O
leave O
without O
trying O
One O
Night O
in O
Tokyo O
. O

Save O
yourself O
the O
time O
and O
trouble O
and O
skip O
this O
one O
! O

This O
is O
my O
favorite O
Italian O
restaurant O
in O
all O
of O
New O
York O
City O
. O

The O
place B-AS
is O
a O
little O
tight O
and O
on O
a O
cold O
day O
, O
the O
seating B-AS
by O
the O
entranceway O
can O
be O
pretty O
drafty O
. O

The O
appetizing B-AS
is O
excellent O
, O
just O
as O
good O
as O
Zabars O
Barney O
Greengrass O
at O
a O
reasonable O
price B-AS
if O
bought O
by O
the O
pound O
. O

But O
, O
they O
were O
too O
big O
for O
the O
bun B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
fresh O
, O
delicious O
, O
and O
reasonably O
priced B-AS
. O

Raga O
stands O
out O
with O
an O
interesting O
fusion B-AS
of I-AS
French I-AS
and I-AS
Indian I-AS
cooking I-AS
. O

A O
few O
tips O
, O
skip O
the O
turnip B-AS
cake I-AS
, O
roast B-AS
pork I-AS
buns I-AS
and O
egg B-AS
custards I-AS
. O

The O
bagels B-AS
are O
fabulous O
. O

Oh O
yes O
, O
and O
they O
lie O
on O
the O
phone O
, O
claiming O
they O
have O
seating B-AS
in I-AS
the I-AS
garden I-AS
, O
then O
of O
course O
the O
seats B-AS
are O
not O
available O
. O

Although O
they O
do O
the O
typical O
what O
kind O
of O
water B-AS
would O
you O
like O
questions O
the O
service B-AS
was O
good O
and O
overall O
very O
relaxing O
to O
place B-AS
to O
eat O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
very O
good O
, O
a O
great O
deal O
, O
and O
the O
place B-AS
its O
self O
was O
great O
. O

The O
food B-AS
options I-AS
rule O
. O

A O
great O
choice O
at O
any O
cost B-AS
and O
a O
great O
deal O
. O

Anybody O
who O
likes O
this O
place O
must O
be O
from O
a O
different O
planet O
, O
where O
greasy O
, O
dry O
and O
tasteless O
are O
complimentary O
. O

We O
ate O
here O
in O
March O
, O
2006 O
and O
ordered O
the O
pre B-AS
- I-AS
theatre I-AS
3-course I-AS
dinner I-AS
with O
wine B-AS
flight I-AS
. O

Definately O
check O
it O
out O
! O
! O
! O

Probably O
much O
busier O
for O
lunch B-AS
, O
it O
's O
seldom O
crowded O
for O
dinner B-AS
too O
close O
to O
downtown O
. O

Their O
calzones B-AS
are O
horrific O
, O
bad O
, O
vomit O
- O
inducing O
, O
YUCK O
. O

It O
takes O
forever O
to O
get O
a O
drink B-AS
and O
they O
almost O
always O
forget O
to O
bring O
something O
although O
they O
do O
n't O
forget O
to O
charge O
you O
for O
it O
. O

The O
place B-AS
itself O
is O
beautiful O
the O
bar B-AS
scene I-AS
seems O
to O
be O
happening O
. O

Saturday O
, O
Nov O
6th O
I O
had O
a O
group O
from O
work O
come O
in O
with O
about O
35 O
people O
and O
the O
staff B-AS
was O
amazing O
to O
accomodate O
us O
. O

Good O
spreads B-AS
, O
great O
beverage B-AS
selections I-AS
and O
bagels B-AS
really O
tasty O
. O

First O
, O
the O
waiter B-AS
who O
served B-AS
us O
neglected O
to O
fill O
us O
in O
on O
the O
specials B-AS
, O
which O
I O
would O
have O
chosen O
had O
I O
known O
about O
them O
. O

We O
will O
be O
back O
. O

Also O
, O
top O
the O
meal B-AS
with O
a O
delicious O
and O
perfect O
slice O
of O
tiramisu B-AS
. O

It O
seems O
like O
this O
is O
a O
place O
the O
locals O
like O
and O
the O
people O
working O
here O
liked O
it O
too O
. O

Check O
out O
the O
secret B-AS
back I-AS
room I-AS
. O

It O
's O
also O
attached O
to O
Angel O
's O
Share O
, O
which O
is O
a O
cool O
, O
more O
romantic O
bar B-AS
. O

Authentic O
food B-AS
and O
they O
have O
REAL O
service B-AS
, O
not O
just O
the O
rush O
you O
get O
sometimes O
when O
they O
try O
to O
push O
you O
out O
the O
door O
. O

Stick O
to O
the O
gulab B-AS
jamun I-AS
. O

I O
am O
amazed O
by O
the O
poor O
reviews O
I O
find O
this O
place O
to O
be O
standout O
Italian O
in O
an O
area O
flooded O
with O
Italian O
great O
prices B-AS
, O
great O
atmosphere B-AS
, O
good O
service B-AS
and O
a O
wonderful O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
. O

I O
was O
back O
- O
to O
- O
back O
with O
the O
diner B-AS
at O
the O
table B-AS
behind O
me O
and O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
had O
to O
hoist O
trays O
over O
our O
heads O
as O
they O
squeezed O
past O
us O
again O
and O
again O
. O

With O
the O
theater O
2 O
blocks O
away O
we O
had O
a O
delicious O
meal B-AS
in O
a O
beautiful O
room B-AS
. O

I O
was O
a O
little O
leary O
about O
Mary O
's O
at O
first O
, O
it O
's O
small O
, O
crowded O
and O
you O
usually O
have O
to O
wait O
on O
line O
, O
but O
I O
' O
m O
glad O
I O
finally O
tried O
it O
. O

We O
were O
not O
dissappointed O
in O
the O
least O
bit O
by O
this O
little O
gem O
. O

Also O
very O
inexpensive O
. O

We O
' O
ve O
only O
eaten O
in O
the O
restaurant O
once O
, O
but O
we O
have O
ordered O
many O
times O
for O
dinner B-AS
. O

I O
got O
enough O
reasons O
to O
keep O
coming O
back O
! O
! O
! O

By O
far O
this O
is O
the O
only O
chinese O
desserts O
place O
I O
know O
in O
NY O
or O
anywhere O
close O
in O
the O
Northeastern O
America O
that O
serves O
desserts B-AS
with I-AS
frog I-AS
jelly I-AS
in O
a O
couple O
of O
varieties O
and O
pig B-AS
feet I-AS
ginger I-AS
simmered I-AS
in I-AS
black I-AS
vinegar I-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
great O
and O
reasonably O
priced B-AS
. O

The O
characters O
really O
make O
for O
an O
enjoyable O
experience O
. O

I O
would O
definitely O
recommend O
SEA O
if O
you O
like O
thai B-AS
cuisine I-AS
! O

Over O
the O
years O
the O
host B-AS
, O
Vittorio O
, O
and O
his O
crew B-AS
, O
have O
always O
treated O
me O
as O
family O
-- O
although O
with O
all O
the O
business O
this O
not O
- O
so O
- O
little O
gem O
does O
, O
it O
amazing O
he O
's O
even O
able O
to O
remember O
a O
consistent O
but O
not O
- O
so O
- O
frequent O
visitor O
. O

The O
restuarant O
itself O
is O
not O
large O
, O
but O
seems O
to O
have O
several O
round B-AS
tables I-AS
to O
accomodate O
large O
groups O
hoping O
to O
save O
a O
buck O
to O
eat O
authentic O
Taiwanese B-AS
. O

My O
husband O
said O
he O
could O
' O
ve O
eaten O
several O
more O
, O
the O
portion O
was O
fine O
for O
me O
he O
even O
exclaimed O
that O
the O
french B-AS
fries I-AS
were O
the O
best O
he O
has O
had O
. O

You O
can O
not O
go O
wrong O
with O
this O
place O
. O

It O
is O
the O
type O
of O
place O
to O
run O
into O
old O
friends O
and O
have O
a O
late O
, O
raucus O
dinner B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
delicious O
, O
from O
the O
specials B-AS
to O
the O
regular B-AS
menu I-AS
- I-AS
fare I-AS
, O
the O
dishes B-AS
are O
never O
a O
disappointment O
. O

Prices B-AS
are O
in O
line O
. O

The O
combination O
of O
fresh B-AS
tomato I-AS
sauce I-AS
, O
fresh B-AS
mozz I-AS
cheese I-AS
, O
basil B-AS
and O
the O
dough B-AS
they O
make O
with O
imported O
flour B-AS
, O
makes O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
better O
pizza B-AS
's O
in O
NY O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
prepared O
quickly O
and O
efficiently O
. O

and O
for O
this O
i O
had O
to O
shell O
out O
a O
small O
fortune O
? O

For O
all O
of O
you O
new O
to O
Indian B-AS
food I-AS
, O
try O
the O
Paneer B-AS
Roll I-AS
, O
it O
is O
a O
piece O
of O
heaven O
. O

The O
food B-AS
looked O
very O
appetizing O
and O
delicious O
since O
it O
came O
on O
a O
variety O
of O
fancy O
plates B-AS
. O

Both O
the O
fresh B-AS
mozzerella I-AS
slices I-AS
and O
the O
Plain B-AS
Cheese I-AS
slice I-AS
are O
phenomenal O
. O

I O
have O
tried O
literally O
every O
restaurant O
on O
curry O
row O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
terrible O
and O
overall O
, O
I O
would O
have O
to O
say O
avoid O
at O
all O
costs O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
been O
to O
this O
monster O
sushi O
twice O
, O
the O
46th O
st O
once O
, O
the O
23rd O
st O
one O
a O
number O
of O
times O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
the O
food B-AS
was O
NOT O
something O
to O
get O
worked O
up O
about O
. O

It O
's O
constantly O
open O
, O
catering O
to O
the O
Pakistani O
cabbies O
lined O
up O
on O
Crosby O
St O
, O
so O
there O
's O
more O
turnover O
with O
the O
food B-AS
than O
you O
'd O
expect O
ie O
, O
surprisingly O
fresh O
. O

I O
had O
Filet B-AS
Mignon I-AS
with I-AS
garlic I-AS
mash I-AS
. O

I O
went O
at O
6 O
, O
00 O
PM O
specifically O
for O
the O
pre B-AS
- I-AS
theater I-AS
menu I-AS
$ O
1995 O
for O
roasted B-AS
tomato I-AS
soup I-AS
with I-AS
chevre I-AS
, O
steak B-AS
frites I-AS
, O
creme B-AS
brulee I-AS
and O
it O
was O
marvelous O
. O

The O
waitstaff B-AS
were O
attentive O
, O
polite O
and O
helpful O
, O
an O
impressive O
feat O
in O
such O
close O
quarters O
. O

Go O
inside O
and O
you O
wo O
n't O
want O
to O
leave O
. O

I O
loving O
bringing O
friends O
here O
, O
and O
I O
do O
so O
every O
chance O
I O
get O
. O

the O
bread B-AS
at O
the O
beginning O
is O
super O
tasty O
and O
makes O
you O
want O
more O
, O
the O
pizza B-AS
is O
delicious O
and O
comes O
in O
personal O
sizes O
, O
however O
be O
warned O
that O
the O
Peter O
's O
Favourite O
pizza B-AS
with O
prosciutto O
and O
baby O
arugula O
is O
actually O
a O
margarite O
pizza B-AS
with O
cold O
prosciutto O
and O
baby O
arugula O
on O
top O
, O
like O
a O
salad B-AS
. O

Yes O
, O
the O
prices O
are O
high O
, O
but O
I O
felt O
it O
was O
worth O
it O
. O

The O
large O
selection O
of O
bruschettas B-AS
, O
paninis B-AS
, O
tramezzinis B-AS
keep O
the O
palate O
from O
stagnating O
. O

Have O
always O
found O
that O
the O
waiters B-AS
will O
go O
out O
of O
their O
way O
to O
be O
helpful O
, O
despite O
the O
fact O
they O
are O
often O
busy O
with O
lots O
of O
diners B-AS
. O

While O
this O
is O
n't O
classical O
restaurant O
fare O
, O
the O
chef B-AS
has O
given O
new O
life O
to O
an O
old O
cuisine B-AS
with O
some O
really O
innovative O
and O
tasty O
dishes B-AS
that O
are O
genuinely O
Indian B-AS
without O
being O
heavy O
or O
same O
old O
restaurant O
burn O
- O
outs O
. O

The O
owner B-AS
truly O
caters O
to O
all O
your O
needs O
. O

He O
takes O
real O
pride O
in O
his O
food B-AS
and O
his O
business O
. O

Every O
time O
in O
New O
York O
I O
make O
it O
a O
point O
to O
visit O
Restaurant O
Saul O
on O
Smith O
Street O
. O

My O
boyfriend O
and O
I O
went O
there O
to O
celebrate O
my O
birthday O
the O
other O
night O
and O
all O
I O
can O
say O
is O
that O
it O
was O
magnificent O
. O

So O
if O
you O
want O
a O
nice O
, O
enjoyable O
meal B-AS
at O
Montparnasse O
, O
go O
early O
for O
the O
pre B-AS
- I-AS
theater I-AS
prix I-AS
- I-AS
fixe I-AS
. O

Over O
the O
years O
, O
it O
has O
always O
provided O
a O
pleasurable O
dining B-AS
experience O
with O
quality O
food B-AS
and O
wine B-AS
. O

I O
would O
go O
back O
tho O
. O

The O
photobook O
menu B-AS
was O
a O
cute O
touch O
, O
certainly O
helped O
my O
group O
and O
I O
pick O
the O
fried B-AS
chicken I-AS
, O
pork B-AS
chop I-AS
, O
and O
noodle B-AS
dishes I-AS
that O
we O
all O
ordered O
. O

too O
large O
for O
just O
two O
people O
but O
nothing O
was O
left O
. O

I O
can O
not O
imagine O
better O
Indian B-AS
food I-AS
in O
all O
of O
the O
city O
. O

Great O
romantic O
place B-AS
for O
a O
date O
try O
to O
get O
the O
corner B-AS
booth I-AS
table I-AS
for O
a O
little O
privacy B-AS
and O
to O
sit O
close O
! O
. O

A O
pleasant O
surprise O
. O

I O
asked O
for O
an O
open B-AS
faced I-AS
cheese I-AS
sandwich I-AS
and O
the O
manager B-AS
basically O
told O
me O
to O
take O
my O
business O
elsewhere O
! O

If O
you O
do O
n't O
mind O
all O
that O
noise O
then O
go O
to O
the O
Chart O
House O
. O

We O
got O
most O
of O
it O
back O
at O
home O
with O
us O
. O

Get O
there O
before O
7 O

everything O

the O
seaweed B-AS
was O
absolutely O
amazing O
. O

This O
place O
started O
off O
a O
little O
iffy O
, O
but O
is O
now O
one O
of O
my O
favorite O
indian O
restaurants O
in O
NYC O
and O
I O
' O
m O
indian O
, O
so O
I O
should O
know O
. O

They O
also O
do O
a O
great O
job O
for O
restaurant O
week O
. O

I O
went O
to O
this O
restaurant O
with O
a O
woman O
that O
I O
met O
recently O
. O

The O
dishes B-AS
offered O
were O
unique O
, O
very O
tasty O
and O
fresh O
from O
the O
lamb B-AS
sausages I-AS
, O
sardines B-AS
with I-AS
biscuits I-AS
, O
large B-AS
whole I-AS
shrimp I-AS
to O
the O
amazing O
pistachio B-AS
ice I-AS
cream I-AS
the O
best O
and O
freshest O
I O
' O
ve O
ever O
had O
. O

This O
is O
where O
the O
aforementioned O
line O
was O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
reliable O
and O
the O
price B-AS
is O
moderate O
. O

Aside O
from O
the O
bearded O
, O
courdoroy O
blazer O
professor O
type O
with O
the O
NYU O
student O
he O
's O
sleeping O
with O
that O
week O
, O
you O
see O
a O
strange O
mix O
of O
hipsters O
, O
frat O
boys O
, O
Will O
Smith O
types O
who O
need O
to O
be O
told O
they O
are O
black O
, O
bitter O
cougars O
who O
ca O
n't O
understand O
why O
they O
are O
nt O
married O
yet O
. O

While O
the O
ambiance B-AS
and O
atmosphere B-AS
were O
great O
, O
the O
food B-AS
and O
service B-AS
could O
have O
been O
a O
lot O
better O
. O

We O
always O
go O
there O
on O
the O
weekends O
and O
leave O
extremely O
full O
and O
satisfied O
. O

i O
do O
n't O
how O
this O
place O
is O
still O
running O
. O

The O
server B-AS
was O
really O
cool O
and O
served B-AS
us O
our O
food B-AS
and O
drinks B-AS
with O
a O
smile O
. O

We O
were O
in O
search O
of O
food B-AS
and O
stumbled O
on O
this O
block O
of O
Indian O
restaurants O
on O
East O
Sixth O
Street O
. O

Planet O
Thailand O
has O
always O
been O
a O
hit O
with O
me O
, O
I O
go O
there O
usually O
for O
the O
sushi B-AS
, O
which O
is O
great O
, O
the O
thai B-AS
food I-AS
is O
excellent O
too O
. O

Very O
excited O
to O
hear O
that O
short O
- O
term O
Chef B-AS
Jason O
Narone O
has O
moved O
on O
, O
he O
truly O
was O
a O
low O
point O
of O
their O
Sterling O
track O
record O
. O

Excellent O
experience O
. O

Well O
worth O
the O
trip O
, O
close O
to O
City O
Hall O
and O
downtown O
subway O
stops O
. O

I O
had O
to O
share O
my O
table B-AS
with O
a O
loud O
group O
of O
kids O
and O
the O
service B-AS
was O
rude O
an O
unattentive O
. O

What O
more O
could O
you O
want O
? O

If O
you O
are O
the O
type O
of O
person O
who O
likes O
being O
scared O
and O
entertained O
, O
this O
is O
a O
great O
place O
to O
go O
and O
eat O
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
see O
how O
you O
can O
go O
wrong O
. O

The O
sauce B-AS
on I-AS
the I-AS
pizza I-AS
is O
sooo O
good O
with O
garlic B-AS
and O
fresh B-AS
tomatoes I-AS
and O
they O
do O
n't O
skimp O
. O

We O
recently O
decided O
to O
try O
this O
location O
, O
and O
to O
our O
delight O
, O
they O
have O
outdoor B-AS
seating I-AS
, O
perfect O
since O
I O
had O
my O
yorkie O
with O
me O
. O

My O
husband O
had O
the O
mesclun B-AS
, O
salmon B-AS
, O
and O
ice B-AS
cream I-AS
and O
he O
enjoyed O
all O
3 O
courses B-AS
. O

We O
were O
told O
that O
the O
wait B-AS
was O
about O
twenty O
minutes O
and O
there O
would O
be O
no O
problem O
for O
our O
8 O
, O
00 O
pm O
curtain O
call O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
usually O
good O
but O
it O
certainly O
is O
n't O
a O
relaxing O
place B-AS
to O
go O
. O

I O
' O
m O
told O
that O
it O
is O
open O
24hrs O
which O
is O
good O
. O

Super O
friendly O
and O
knowledgable O
staff B-AS
, O
fabulous O
bistro B-AS
fare I-AS
and O
a O
wonderful O
jazz B-AS
brunch I-AS
with O
great O
live B-AS
jazz I-AS
the O
chilaquiles B-AS
were O
awesome O
! O

The O
prices B-AS
were O
fantastic O
. O

What O
a O
great O
place O
! O

Still O
, O
any O
quibbles O
about O
the O
bill O
were O
off O
- O
set O
by O
the O
pour O
- O
your O
- O
own O
measures B-AS
of I-AS
liquers I-AS
which O
were O
courtesey O
of O
the O
house O
. O

The O
table O
service B-AS
could O
have O
been O
a O
little O
more O
attentive O
but O
as O
someone O
who O
also O
works O
in O
the O
service B-AS
industry O
, O
I O
understood O
they O
were O
busy O
. O

It O
's O
not O
mind O
- O
blowing O
, O
but O
to O
me O
, O
thai B-AS
food I-AS
never O
is O
and O
never O
will O
be O
. O

Food B-AS
was O
very O
good O
as O
well O
, O
considering O
that O
we O
tried O
the O
budget O
selection O
though O
I O
wish O
the O
pork B-AS
belly I-AS
that O
I O
ordered O
was O
roasted O
a O
bit O
longer O
, O
so O
that O
fat B-AS
was O
more O
of O
a O
melt O
- O
in O
- O
your O
- O
mouth O
experience O
. O

Although O
, O
one O
night O
we O
went O
it O
was O
super O
cheesy O
, O
and O
another O
night O
it O
was O
less O
cheesy O
. O

Even O
though O
it O
is O
a O
little O
loud O
, O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
yell O
at O
each O
other O
to O
talk O
. O

i O
' O
ve O
been O
to O
sapphire O
twice O
and O
both O
times O
the O
food B-AS
was O
fine O
, O
if O
not O
good O
. O

It O
is O
kinda O
nosiy O
and O
the O
tables B-AS
are O
close O
together O
but O
it O
's O
still O
a O
beautiful O
place B-AS
to O
enjoy O
a O
nice O
dinner B-AS
. O

Was O
surprisingly O
disappointed O
. O

I O
love O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
pizza B-AS
tastes O
so O
good O
and O
is O
so O
cheap O
. O

Nicky O
the O
Nose O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
is O
a O
treat O
. O

I O
went O
to O
Ruby O
Foo O
's O
after O
work O
with O
a O
group O
of O
6 O
. O

I O
' O
m O
amazed O
we O
have O
n't O
been O
kicked O
out O
of O
this O
place O
yet O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
prompt O
, O
friendly O
and O
great O
. O

I O
have O
n't O
eat O
a O
lamb B-AS
chop I-AS
as O
delicious O
as O
that O
, O
the O
salads B-AS
are O
really O
nice O
dressed O
with O
lemon B-AS
and O
extra B-AS
virgnin I-AS
olive I-AS
oil I-AS
. O

The O
sushi B-AS
was O
awful O
! O

Katz O
's O
has O
been O
a O
NYC O
original O
for O
over O
100 O
years O
. O

You O
can O
get O
an O
excellent O
meal B-AS
at O
most O
of O
the O
many O
Indian O
restaurants O
on O
nearby O
Lexington O
Avenue O
for O
the O
cost O
of O
one O
the O
dainty O
dishes B-AS
here O
. O

The O
Pastrami B-AS
sandwich I-AS
was O
like O
buttah O
and O
with O
pickles B-AS
and O
an O
icy O
cold O
beer B-AS
to O
wash O
it O
down O
, O
it O
was O
a O
pleasurable O
experience O
. O

The O
plain B-AS
pizza I-AS
was O
soggy O
and O
the O
creative O
wild B-AS
mushroom(third I-AS
generation I-AS
- I-AS
Fornini I-AS
) I-AS
pizza I-AS
we O
had O
was O
drenched O
with O
truffle B-AS
oil I-AS
in O
the O
middle O
again O
making O
it O
soggy O
and O
nothingon O
the O
rest O
. O

Late O
nite O
omelletes B-AS
are O
not O
good O
here O
, O
there O
is O
no O
variety O
! O

Everything O
at O
Sala O
Thai O
is O
tasty O
and O
well O
- O
portioned O
. O

After O
all O
that O
, O
they O
complained O
to O
me O
about O
the O
small O
tip B-AS
. O

It O
's O
a O
great O
place O
to O
pick O
up O
a O
cheap O
lunch B-AS
or O
dinner B-AS
. O

Behind O
this O
counter B-AS
, O
two O
men O
are O
squeezed O
in O
. O

Great O
find O
! O
! O
! O

If O
only O
they O
delivered O
, O
they O
'd O
make O
a O
mint O
! O

Whenever O
you O
need O
a O
Sushi B-AS
fix I-AS
, O
Mizu O
will O
be O
there O
with O
quality O
fish B-AS
and O
great O
service B-AS
. O

Our O
waitress B-AS
was O
sweet O
and O
accomodating O
, O
not O
overbearing O
. O

Went O
there O
with O
my O
wife O
and O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
a O
table B-AS
even O
though O
you O
could O
see O
there O
many O
that O
were O
empty O
with O
not O
reservation B-AS
sigh I-AS
on O
them O
. O

I O
was O
really O
disappointed O
ant O
wanted O
to O
tell O
everyone O
not O
to O
go O
eat O
or O
even O
take O
out O
food B-AS
from O
there O
. O

The O
website O
and O
rating O
makes O
this O
place O
look O
wonderful O
but O
in O
reality O
it O
was O
very O
disappointing O
. O

Despite O
a O
slightly O
limited O
menu B-AS
, O
everything O
prepared O
is O
done O
to O
perfection O
, O
ultra O
fresh O
and O
a O
work O
of O
food B-AS
art I-AS
. O

The O
outdoor B-AS
atmosphere I-AS
of O
sitting O
on O
the O
sidewalk O
watching O
the O
world O
go O
by O
50 O
feet O
away O
on O
6th O
avenue O
on O
a O
cool O
evening O
was O
wonderful O
. O

A O
large O
is O
$ O
20 O
, O
and O
toppings B-AS
are O
about O
$ O
3 O
each O
. O

In O
any O
event O
, O
this O
is O
a O
place O
I O
'll O
be O
sure O
to O
stop O
by O
again O
when O
I O
' O
m O
in O
this O
part O
of O
town O
. O

I O
definitely O
would O
n't O
go O
back O
. O

It O
is O
not O
worth O
for O
that O
bucks O
. O

brick O
oven O
gallery O
is O
My O
pick O
for O
best O
pizza B-AS
restaurant O
anywhere O
. O

Add O
to O
that O
great O
service B-AS
and O
great O
food B-AS
at O
a O
reasonable O
price B-AS
and O
you O
have O
yourself O
the O
beginning O
of O
a O
great O
evening O
. O

For O
many O
people O
, O
this O
may O
not O
seem O
like O
Aunthentic O
Thai B-AS
food I-AS
because O
most O
places O
in O
NYC O
are O
nt O
quite O
authentic O
. O

Growing O
up O
in O
NY O
, O
I O
have O
eaten O
my O
share O
of O
bagels B-AS
. O

Oh O
, O
do O
n't O
even O
let O
me O
start O
with O
how O
expensive O
the O
bills B-AS
were O
! O

A O
hearty O
two O
thumbs O
up O
! O

The O
scallion B-AS
pancakes I-AS
and O
fried B-AS
dumplings I-AS
were O
nothing O
out O
of O
the O
ordinary O
. O

All O
the O
appetizers B-AS
and O
salads B-AS
were O
fabulous O
, O
the O
steak B-AS
was O
mouth O
watering O
and O
the O
pasta B-AS
was O
delicious O
! O
! O
! O

Besides O
having O
the O
table B-AS
we O
had O
been O
promised O
given O
to O
other O
restaurant O
patrons O
twice O
before O
we O
were O
actually O
seated O
, O
we O
were O
served B-AS
dishes I-AS
we O
had O
n't O
ordered O
three O
times O
, O
received O
one O
of O
our O
orders O
20 O
minutes O
after O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
table B-AS
had O
been O
served B-AS
and O
that O
order O
was O
undercooked O
, O
and O
charged O
$ O
45 O
more O
than O
we O
should O
have O
been O
on O
our O
bill B-AS
. O

Service B-AS
is O
top O
notch O
. O

The O
food B-AS
now O
is O
inconsistent O
. O

All O
pretty O
good O
. O

You O
can O
also O
special O
order O
any O
kind O
of O
dumpling B-AS
, O
etc O
. O

you O
guys O
rock O
. O

Chance O
is O
a O
joke O
. O

I O
was O
pretty O
much O
full O
after O
our O
fondue B-AS
appetizer I-AS
. O

BE O
CAREFUL O
before O
you O
request O
extra O
spice B-AS
. O

The O
octopus O
eaters O
were O
floored O
by O
the O
Octopus B-AS
salad I-AS
. O

We O
thought O
that O
this O
place O
is O
using O
too O
much O
of O
MSG B-AS
cooking I-AS
in O
the O
foods B-AS
. O

I O
was O
at O
Rao O
's O
last O
We O
d O
. O

And O
the O
Tom B-AS
Kha I-AS
soup I-AS
was O
pathetic O
. O

I O
started O
out O
with O
a O
Bombay B-AS
beer I-AS
which O
was O
big O
enough O
for O
two O
. O

The O
decor B-AS
is O
vibrant O
and O
eye O
- O
pleasing O
with O
several O
semi B-AS
- I-AS
private I-AS
boths I-AS
on O
the O
right O
side O
of O
the O
dining B-AS
hall I-AS
, O
which O
are O
great O
for O
a O
date O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
quick O
. O

Tends O
to O
turn O
people O
away O
. O

We O
thought O
this O
a O
prelude O
to O
what O
the O
evening O
will O
be O
like O
. O

I O
was O
turned O
on O
to O
this O
restaurant O
by O
a O
fellow O
foodie O
friend O
of O
mine O
, O
and O
have O
been O
going O
back O
regularly O
ever O
since O
. O

Drawbacks O
, O
service B-AS
is O
slow O
and O
they O
do O
n't O
toast O
! O

Went O
there O
for O
an O
office B-AS
lunch I-AS
. O

I O
have O
been O
doing O
all O
of O
the O
above O
at O
the O
Heartland O
Brewery O
for O
over O
5 O
years O
now O
and O
I O
HAVE O
NEVER O
BEEN O
DISAPPOINTED O
! O

Everytime O
I O
decide O
to O
try O
another O
place O
on O
the O
UES O
, O
I O
get O
angry O
that O
I O
did O
n't O
just O
go O
to O
Zucchero O
Pomodori O
. O

The O
sweet B-AS
lassi I-AS
was O
excellent O
as O
was O
the O
lamb B-AS
chettinad I-AS
and O
the O
garlic B-AS
naan I-AS
but O
the O
rasamalai B-AS
was O
forgettable O
. O

We O
' O
ve O
been O
following O
chef B-AS
Lyle O
's O
food B-AS
around O
New O
York O
for O
15 O
years O
and O
while O
remaining O
classic O
, O
his O
innovations O
with O
bistro B-AS
fare I-AS
have O
made O
us O
return O
and O
return O
. O

The O
best O
thing O
I O
tasted O
were O
the O
lambchops B-AS
. O

it O
's O
delicious O
! O

The O
spicy B-AS
tuna I-AS
and O
salmon B-AS
are O
the O
best O
we O
' O
ve O
ever O
had O
. O

Even O
though O
its O
good O
seafood B-AS
, O
the O
prices B-AS
are O
too O
high O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
food B-AS
is O
very O
good O
and O
the O
prices B-AS
are O
reasonable O
. O

Upon O
entering O
, O
we O
were O
greeted O
by O
the O
owners B-AS
, O
Steven O
and O
Frederick O
, O
who O
went O
out O
of O
their O
way O
to O
be O
more O
than O
gracious O
hosts B-AS
. O

If O
you O
live O
outside O
the O
neighborhood O
, O
do O
n't O
bother O
! O

Been O
going O
here O
since O
it O
opened O
have O
seen O
the O
quality B-AS
value I-AS
decrease O
considerably O
. O

Meat B-AS
dishes I-AS
now O
adorn O
the O
selections O
, O
although O
there O
's O
still O
a O
large O
number O
of O
vegetarian B-AS
- I-AS
friendly I-AS
choices I-AS
. O

I O
never O
had O
anything O
I O
did O
n't O
like O
here O
. O

Reasonable O
prices B-AS
. O

they O
bring O
service B-AS
up O
a O
notch O
by O
offerng O
complementary O
amuse B-AS
bouche I-AS
to O
all O
tables B-AS
and O
gave O
us O
a O
small O
dessert B-AS
for O
our O
celebration O
. O

Try O
the O
crunchy B-AS
tuna I-AS
, O
it O
is O
to O
die O
for O
. O

It O
wo O
n't O
break O
the O
bank O
but O
I O
also O
would O
n't O
come O
back O
for O
the O
food B-AS
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
this O
midtown O
gem O
instantly O
became O
one O
of O
my O
favorite O
sushi B-AS
restaurants O
in O
the O
city O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
been O
to O
Joya O
twice O
and O
I O
will O
never O
go O
again O
. O

So O
rushing O
us O
out O
was O
absolutely O
unnecessary O
! O

However O
it O
is O
the O
ONLY O
Taiwanese O
restaurant O
in O
town O
. O

It O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
fun O
with O
live B-AS
entertainment I-AS
and O
all O
kinds O
of O
Disney O
type O
special B-AS
effects I-AS
. O

if O
you O
're O
looking O
for O
perfect O
traditional O
sushi B-AS
, O
go O
here O
, O
if O
you O
're O
looking O
for O
interesting O
combinations O
, O
try O
sushi B-AS
of O
gari O
's O
east O
side O
. O

No O
refills O
on O
fountain B-AS
drinks I-AS
, O
though O
. O

Wow O
over O
100 O
beers B-AS
to O
choose O
from O
. O

Be O
careful O
of O
portions B-AS
, O
they O
're O
HUGE O
. O

The O
Steak B-AS
Tartare I-AS
is O
a O
great O
bet O
, O
they O
fix O
it O
for O
you O
at O
the O
table O
. O

My O
first O
time O
there O
I O
happened O
not O
to O
like O
the O
Crab B-AS
Croquette I-AS
apt I-AS
that O
i O
ordered O
and O
they O
were O
happy O
to O
change O
it O
for O
me O
without O
making O
no O
big O
deal O
. O

Great O
for O
large O
groups O
and O
celebrations O
, O
our O
SUPER O
HAPPY O
waiter B-AS
was O
the O
entertainment O
of O
the O
evening O
. O

Did O
I O
mention O
the O
wine B-AS
? O

Plus O
, O
on O
Wednesday O
nights O
the O
house B-AS
wine I-AS
is O
unlimited O
! O

It O
is O
by O
far O
my O
favorite O
restaurant O
in O
Brooklyn O
. O

Now O
it O
's O
so O
crowded O
and O
loud O
you O
ca O
n't O
even O
talk O
to O
the O
person O
next O
to O
you O
. O

Love O

Even O
my O
Indian O
friend O
could O
n't O
believe O
how O
good O
and O
tasty O
everything O
was O
. O

I O
' O
m O
from O
England O
, O
and O
Haru O

the O
best O
I O
had O

I O
' O
ve O

of O
times O

have O
not O

Ciao O
Bella O

like O
saying O
her O
bread B-AS
comes O
from O
a O
special O
bakery O
when O
we O
have O
seen O
her O
buying O
it O
dowtown O
manhathan O
. O

The O
dim B-AS
sum I-AS
servings I-AS
here O
are O
a O
bit O
larger O
than O
I O
' O
m O
used O
to O
. O

However O
, O
in O
the O
summer O
of O
2003 O
, O
it O
seems O
the O
management B-AS
has O
changed O
and O
the O
great O
big O
door B-AS
has O
been O
replaced O
for O
a O
glass B-AS
front I-AS
ridding O
itself O
of O
the O
dark O
romantic O
getup O
. O

We O
wo O
n't O
go O
to O
this O
place O
again O
for O
a O
good O
meal B-AS
. O

It O
's O
a O
much O
more O
grown O
up O
restaurant O
compared O
to O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
street O
. O

Barbecued B-AS
codfish I-AS
was O
gorgeously O
moist O
, O
as O
if O
poached O
, O
yet O
the O
fabulous O
texture O
was O
let O
down O
by O
curiously O
bland O
seasoning B-AS
, O
a O
spice B-AS
rub I-AS
might O
have O
overwhelmed O
, O
however O
herb B-AS
mix I-AS
or O
other O
sauce B-AS
would O
have O
done O
much O
to O
enhance O
. O

We O
were O
treated O
with O
attitude O
ever O
since O
the O
moment O
we O
stepped O
into O
the O
restaurant O
! O

After O
dinner B-AS
, O
take O
your O
date O
to O
the O
HUGE O
dance B-AS
floor I-AS
, O
probably O
one O
of O
the O
biggest O
you O
'll O
see O
in O
NY O
. O

Taj O
Mahal O
offeres O
gret O
value B-AS
and O
great O
food B-AS
. O

Has O
the O
chef B-AS
and O
owner B-AS
changed O
? O
? O
? O

My O
boyfriend O
and O
I O
recently O
had O
an O
early O
dinner B-AS
at O
Artisanal O
and O
was O
satisfied O
with O
our O
experience O
. O

I O
absolutely O
Loved O
this O
place O
. O

I O
wish O
I O
lived O
there O
as O
I O
would O
eat O
at O
this O
place O
as O
often O
as O
possible O
! O

But O
do O
n't O
ever O
order O
bacon B-AS
late O
at O
nite O
either O
platter B-AS
or O
in B-AS
sandwiches I-AS
, O
for O
that O
matter O
do O
n't O
from O
any O
take O
out O
place O
as O
it O
is O
from O
the O
morning O
frying B-AS
turns O
out O
hard O
almost O
like O
bacos B-AS
, O
hurt O
my O
molars O
. O

Outstanding O
Bagels B-AS
, O
but O
you O
get O
what O
you O
pay O
for O
. O

Pizza B-AS
, O
the O
only O
pizza B-AS
in O
NYC O
that O
should O
not O
have O
additional O
toppings B-AS
, O
the O
crust B-AS
tastes O
like O
the O
best O
, O
freshly O
baked O
bread B-AS
! O

If O
you O
're O
in O
town O
, O
it O
's O
worth O
searching O
for O
another O
place O
. O

I O
have O
tried O
the O
various O
slice O
joints O
around O
the O
village O
but O
this O
is O
by O
far O
the O
best O
one O
. O

I O
found O
it O
on O
a O
cold O
night O
, O
the O
perfect O
spot B-AS
to O
warm O
up O
. O

They O
even O
have O
a O
section O
in O
the O
menu B-AS
called O
American B-AS
Chinese I-AS
food I-AS
! O

Service B-AS
was O
warm O
and O
attentive O
, O
beef B-AS
carpaachio I-AS
was O
exellent O
huge O
portion B-AS
and O
pasta B-AS
was O
fresh O
and O
well O
- O
prepared O
. O

kalbi B-AS
and O
nebbiolo B-AS
do O
work O
together O
. O

Best O
Italian B-AS
food I-AS
I O
ever O
had O
and O
being O
Italian O
, O
that O
means O
alot O
. O

I O
will O
recommend O
Scopa O
to O
all O
of O
my O
friends O
for O
a O
place O
to O
go O
for O
wonderful O
Italian B-AS
food I-AS
. O

Located B-AS
at O
the O
end O
of O
a O
magnificent O
block O
. O

This O
restaurant O
is O
not O
worth O
the O
time O
, O
effort O
, O
or O
money O
to O
say O
the O
least O
. O

Looking O
around O
, O
I O
saw O
a O
room B-AS
full O
of O
New O
Yorkers O
enjoying O
a O
real O
meal B-AS
in O
a O
real O
restaurant O
, O
not O
a O
clubhouse B-AS
of O
the O
fabulous O
trying O
to O
be O
seen O
. O

Keep O
up O
the O
good O
work O
guys O
! O

Hurley O
's O
is O
terrific O
! O

They O
do O
n't O
walk O
around O
with O
the O
trays B-AS
of I-AS
Dim I-AS
Sum I-AS
. O

Took O
my O
sister O
here O
before O
attending O
a O
show O
one O
evening O
. O

Great O
bar B-AS
, O
most O
gorgeous O
bar B-AS
you O
' O
ve O
ever O
seen O
specifically O
the O
blond O
lady O
. O

We O
were O
planning O
to O
get O
dessert B-AS
but O
the O
waitress B-AS
basically O
through O
the O
bill B-AS
at O
us O
before O
we O
had O
a O
chance O
to O
order O
. O

Really O
. O

I O
really O
loved O
the O
different O
and O
inovated O
touch O
that O
's O
the O
cheff B-AS
gives O
to O
the O
food B-AS
. O

Our O
friends O
have O
not O
arrived O
yet O
. O

They O
came O
out O
over O
cooked O
and O
the O
cheese B-AS
was O
almost O
non O
existant O
. O

I O
had O
a O
terrific O
meal B-AS
, O
and O
our O
server B-AS
guided O
us O
toward O
a O
very O
nice O
wine B-AS
in O
our O
price B-AS
range I-AS
, O
instead O
of O
allowing O
us O
to O
purchase O
a O
similarly O
priced B-AS
wine I-AS
that O
was O
n't O
as O
good O
. O

The O
svc B-AS
can O
be O
a O
bit O
rude O
at O
times O
, O
esp O
if O
you O
have O
big O
group O
, O
but O
overall O
the O
restaurant O
is O
a O
must O
! O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
thougt O
it O
would O
be O
great O
to O
go O
to O
the O
Jekyll O
and O
Hyde O
Pub O
for O
our O
anniversary O
, O
and O
to O
our O
surprise O
it O
was O
fantastic O
. O

Never O
once O
did O
I O
leave O
feeling O
unwelcome O
or O
impressed O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
good O
, O
especially O
their O
more O
basic O
dishes B-AS
, O
and O
the O
drinks B-AS
are O
delicious O
. O

But O
the O
main O
hit O
was O
the O
whole B-AS
grilled I-AS
fish I-AS
. O

I O
had O
the O
tuna B-AS
tartare I-AS
with O
sake B-AS
, O
mushroom B-AS
ravioli I-AS
with O
pinot B-AS
noir I-AS
, O
and O
the O
chocolate B-AS
sampler I-AS
with O
a O
dessert B-AS
wine I-AS
for O
$ O
49 O
. O

On O
a O
hot O
day O
it O
was O
fabulous O
to O
stop O
in O
and O
enjoy O
lunch B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
delicious O
and O
beautifully O
prepared O
along O
with O
the O
friendly O
and O
personable O
service B-AS
. O

I O
usually O
go O
there O
later O
at O
night O
when O
I O
get O
off O
work O
so O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
deal O
with O
crowds B-AS
or O
lines B-AS
. O

Pizza B-AS
here O
is O
consistently O
good O
. O

We O
had O
a O
great O
tiem O
watching O
the O
shows B-AS
and O
characters B-AS
and O
ar O
food B-AS
was O
just O
what O
we O
were O
looking O
for O
. O

After O
2 O
tries O
by O
the O
waiter B-AS
to O
take O
it O
away O
we O
had O
n't O
even O
looked O
at O
it O
yet O
, O
we O
had O
full O
beers B-AS
yet O
to O
drink O
, O
the O
manager B-AS
approached O
and O
told O
us O
they O
needed O
the O
table O
for O
people O
with O
reservations B-AS
. O

Would O
n't O
recomend O
it O
for O
dinner B-AS
! O

Sauce B-AS
was O
watery O
and O
the O
food B-AS
did O
n't O
have O
much O
flavor B-AS
. O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
enjoy O
Sangria B-AS
. O

But O
after O
last O
night O
, O
Spice O
Grill O
is O
the O
only O
place O
I O
' O
m O
eating O
indian B-AS
cuisine I-AS
. O

We O
both O
opted O
for O
a O
pasta B-AS
dish I-AS
and O
they O
were O
served B-AS
timely O
and O
fresh O
. O

First O
the O
wrong O
bread B-AS
came O
out O
with O
the O
appetizer B-AS
, O
then O
when O
i O
tried O
to O
order O
a O
second O
glass B-AS
of I-AS
wine I-AS
for O
my O
main B-AS
course I-AS
. O

Not O
sure O
where O
the O
previous O
reviewer O
, O
lonk O
, O
dined O
, O
but O
Saul O
is O
in O
a O
great O
neighborhood B-AS
and O
has O
great O
food B-AS
! O

In O
an O
area O
sadly O
lacking O
in O
decent O
Thai B-AS
food I-AS
, O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
spots O
. O

Tell O
them O
Herky O
sent O
you O
and O
get O
a O
free O
confused O
look O
from O
the O
waiter B-AS
. O

Make O
reservations B-AS
but O
expect O
to O
be O
delayed O
15 O
- O
20 O
minutes O
as O
the O
hosting B-AS
staff I-AS
was O
having O
difficulty O
seating B-AS
guests O
who O
arrived O
with O
a O
reservation B-AS
because O
they O
probably O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
walk O
ins O
being O
so O
close O
to O
Time O
Square O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
average O
or O
above O
including O
some O
surprising O
tasty O
dishes B-AS
. O

They O
do O
n't O
seem O
to O
place O
an O
emphasis O
on O
specials B-AS
or O
fresh O
ingredients B-AS
which O
to O
me O
is O
necessary O
for O
good O
thai B-AS
. O

Other O
apetizers B-AS
and O
food B-AS

The O
noodle B-AS
and I-AS
rices I-AS
dishes I-AS
taste O
great O
. O

The O
food B-AS
's O
as O
good O
as O
ever O
. O

The O
crust B-AS
is O
thin O
, O
the O
ingredients B-AS
are O
fresh O
and O
the O
staff B-AS
is O
friendly O
. O

Your O
friends O
will O
thank O
you O
for O
introducing O
them O
to O
this O
gem O
! O

Also O
a O
little O
more O
expensive O
than O
your O
average O
bagel B-AS
place O
. O

the O
food B-AS
was O
undercooked O
- O
the O
sauce B-AS
watery O
, O
and O
the O
vegetables B-AS
raw O
. O

And O
the O
fried B-AS
clams I-AS
had O
just O
enough O
kick O
to O
them O
to O
make O
em O
worth O
eating O
. O

The O
sauces B-AS
used O
are O
also O
not O
that O
exciting O
. O

The O
secret O
is O
the O
lunch B-AS
menu I-AS
which O
offers O
a O
complimentary O
appetizer B-AS
with O
every O
entree B-AS
ordered O
. O

I O
absolutely O
love O
this O
place O
! O
! O
! O

The O
rice B-AS
was O
poor O
quality B-AS
and O
was O
cooked B-AS
so O
badly O
it O
was O
hard O
. O

We O
had O
champagne B-AS
and O
caviar B-AS
and O
felt O
like O
princesses O
! O

The O
shrimp B-AS
scampi I-AS
was O
excellent O
and O
the O
antipasti B-AS
were O
plentiful O
. O

I O
am O
surprised O
to O
say O
the O
least O
and O
find O
such O
practice O
not O
worth O
the O
effort O
. O

When O
my O
dessert B-AS
came O
, O
there O
was O
a O
candle O
in O
it O
, O
not O
because O
anyone O
asked O
for O
one O
, O
but O
because O
the O
waiter B-AS
must O
have O
seen O
me O
opening O
my O
birthday O
card O
and O
gift O
, O
and O
said O
he O
knew O
it O
was O
a O
special O
occassion O
of O
some O
sort O
. O

I O
got O
the O
$ O
10 O
10-piece O
dim B-AS
sum I-AS
combo I-AS
, O
every O
bite O
of O
which O
was O
great O
. O

There O
are O
other O
Vietnamese O
restaurants O
in O
the O
chinatown O
area O
and O
you O
can O
forget O
about O
those O
. O

There O
is O
also O
very O
limited O
seating B-AS
and O
there O
can O
be O
a O
substantial O
wait B-AS
in O
getting O
food B-AS
at O
peak O
times O
. O

If O
it O
's O
just O
a O
quick O
martini B-AS
at O
the O
bar B-AS
which O
I O
recommend O
Jeffery O
's O

, O
go O
to O
Village O
! O

No O
thanks O
! O
! O
! O

There O
was O
a O
long O
wait B-AS
for O
a O
table B-AS
outside O
, O
but O
it O
was O
a O
little O
too O
hot O
in O
the O
sun O
anyway O
so O
our O
insde O
table B-AS
was O
very O
nice O
. O

I O
would O
definently O
recommend O
this O
restaurant O
. O

The O
prices B-AS
are O
wonderfully O
low O
. O

If O
you O
like O
spicy B-AS
food I-AS
get O
the O
chicken B-AS
vindaloo I-AS
. O

I O
lOVE O
THIS O
PLACE O
! O

I O
have O
never O
been O
disappointed O
but O
their O
true O
strength O
lays O
in O
their O
amazingly O
delicious O
and O
cheap O
lunch B-AS
specials I-AS
. O

So O
much O
more O
than O
the O
usual O
bar B-AS
food I-AS
, O
go O
there O
to O
enjoy O
the O
menu B-AS
while O
sampling O
one O
of O
their O
hand B-AS
- I-AS
crafted I-AS
beers I-AS
. O

A O
big O
disappointment O
, O
all O
around O
. O

And O
its O
absolutely O
DELICIOUS O
. O

No O
free O
drink B-AS
. O

I O
would O
say O
that O
all O
was O
fine O
and O
tasty O
but O
the O
heaviness O
on O
my O
stomach O
someting O
that O
i O
ca O
n't O
not O
mention O
or O
undermine O
. O

This O
is O
my O
first O
time O
writing O
a O
review O
for O
a O
restaurant O
because O
the O
food B-AS
and O
service B-AS
was O
excellent O
. O

Definitely O
Highly O
NOT O
recommended O
. O

While O
they O
keep O
the O
capex B-AS
to O
a O
minimum O
, O
they O
do O
put O
some O
cash O
into O
the O
bagels B-AS
, O
because O
they O
among O
the O
best O
in O
the O
city O
. O

I O
had O
a O
huge O
group O
for O
my O
birthday O
and O
we O
were O
well O
taken O
care O
of O
. O

The O
two O
star O
chefs B-AS
left O
quite O
some O
time O
ago O
to O
open O
their O
own O
place O
. O

Do O
n't O
waste O
money O
on O
decor B-AS
. O

They O
also O
have O
a O
back B-AS
garden I-AS
open O
in O
the O
summer O
, O
cute O
and O
French O
with O
outdoor B-AS
seating I-AS
, O
what O
more O
could O
you O
ask O
for O
? O

go O
to O
any O
corned O
indian O
restaurant O
, O
and O
the O
little O
india O
strip O
along O
east O
6 O
st O
rules O
supreme O
! O

I O
have O
never O
before O
eaten O
40 O
pieces O
of O
relatively O
good O
nigiri B-AS
. O

Given O
the O
incredible O
architecture B-AS
surrounding O
it O
, O
this O
place B-AS
has O
no O
character O
. O

I O
'd O
call O
it O
an O
italian O
dinner B-AS
' O
. O

my O
first O
time O
here O
was O
with O
my O
gf O
for O
our O
12 O
month O
anniversary O
. O

While O
the O
place B-AS
is O
not O
a O
hotspot O
hangout O
, O
the O
drinks B-AS
are O
unique O
and O
pack O
a O
lot O
of O
bang O
for O
the O
buck O
. O

I O
have O
walked O
by O
this O
place O
for O
eons O
and O
finally O
went O
thanks O
to O
a O
girls O
night O
. O

Have O
frequented O
ino O
for O
several O
years O
and O
the O
food B-AS
remains O
excellent O
. O

Their O
eggplant B-AS
is O
so O
delicate O
, O
sweet O
tender O
! O

I O
pray O
it O
stays O
open O
forever O
. O

Each O
bite O
of O
food B-AS
at O
Kai O
was O
indeed O
delicious O
, O
fresh O
, O
and O
elegant O
. O

all O
the O
food B-AS
was O
excellent O
, O
considering O
the O
quality O
of O
food B-AS
in O
most O
moderately O
priced B-AS
restaurants O
is O
mediocre O
this O
was O
slightly O
more O
pricey O
and O
well O
worth O
it O
. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
save O
some O
money O
, O
do O
n't O
go O
here O
. O

My O
friend O
got O
the O
mushroom B-AS
pizza I-AS
which O
tasted O
better O
. O

I O
had O
the O
cod B-AS
with I-AS
paella I-AS
spicy O
and O
very O
filling O
, O
I O
' O
m O
a O
big O
eater O
and O
could O
only O
eat O
half O
while O
my O
boyfriend O
had O
the O
classic O
fish B-AS
and I-AS
chips I-AS
again O
, O
a O
big O
serving B-AS
, O
at O
least O
5 O
pieces O
of O
fish B-AS
and O
a O
basketful O
of O
fries B-AS
. O

It O
's O
a O
shame O
that O
a O
nice O
, O
convenient O
place B-AS
like O
the O
Pink O
Pony O
can O
be O
so O
ruined O
by O
lousy O
service B-AS
. O

This O
is O
the O
first O
time O
Citysearch O
did't O
call O
it O
right O
. O

You O
should O
pass O
on O
the O
calamari B-AS
. O

The O
porcini B-AS
mushroom I-AS
pasta I-AS
special I-AS
was O
tasteless O
, O
so O
was O
the O
seafood B-AS
tagliatelle I-AS
. O

Try O
the O
spicy B-AS
wontons I-AS
and O
the O
salt B-AS
pepper I-AS
shrimps I-AS
. O

THE O
FOOD B-AS
PORTIONS I-AS
ARE O
REALLY O
LARGE O
. O

The O
fries B-AS
are O
yummy O

Friendly O

Best O
Taiwanese B-AS
food I-AS
in O
NY O
! O

I O
have O
eaten O
at O
many O
pizza O
places O
around O
NYC O
and O
this O
is O
hands O
down O
the O
worst O
. O

This O
place O
is O
a O
great O
stop O
for O
great O
food B-AS
. O

All O
the O
pastas B-AS
are O
fantastic O
and O
the O
homemade B-AS
lasagna I-AS
is O
some O
of O
the O
best O
that O
I O
have O
had O
in O
the O
City O
. O

What O
for O
? O

Fantastic O
! O

they O
were O
dry O
and O
disgusting O
, O
i O
did O
n't O
even O
finish O
my O
first O
piece O
. O

HIGHLY O
RECOMMENDED O
for O
a O
first O
date O
. O

We O
laughed O
when O
he O
finally O
offered O
us O
a O
dessert B-AS
menu I-AS
and O
we O
left O
a O
10 O
percent O
tip B-AS
, O
which O
was O
generous O
, O
I O
feel O
. O

And O
the O
prices B-AS
were O
way O
to O
high O
for O
what O
you O
get O
. O

But O
people O
from O
Sichuan O
will O
die O
for O
it O
, O
Chongqing O
Hot O
Pot O
, O
chongqing O
was O
the O
biggest O
city O
of O
Sichuan O
, O
now O
became O
an O
independent O
province O
. O

Skip O
Baroanda O
down O
the O
street O
Eurotrashy O
, O
snooty O
and O
expensive O
and O
check O
this O
place O
out O
! O

Skip O
this O
location O
and O
go O
to O
the O
one O
in O
Soho O
. O

The O
staff B-AS
ignored O
my O
friends O
and O
I O
the O
entire O
time O
we O
were O
there O
. O

Yet O
paired O
with O
such O
rude O
service B-AS
, O
would O
never O
recommend O
for O
anyone O
interested O
in O
carrying O
any O
kind O
of O
conversation O
while O
there O
. O

I O
went O
to O
Areo O
on O
a O
Sunday O
afternoon O
with O
four O
of O
my O
girlfriends O
, O
and O
spent O
three O
enjoyable O
hours O
there O

The O

DJ I-AS
on O
Saturday O
nights O
has O
outrageously O
good O
taste O
in O

and O
moreover O
, O
takes O
requests O
. O

I O
need O
at O
least O
three O
rolls B-AS
to O
be O
full O
, O
and O
that O
's O
at O

$ O
1400 O

. O

Anyone O
who O
ever O
dined O
at O
a O
thai O
restaurant O
is O
in O
for O
a O
huge O
disappointment O
. O

All O
of O
it O
was O
simply O
amazing O
, O
unique O
and O
tasty O
and O
best O
of O
all O
it O
did O
n't O
break O
the O

Great O

The O
hot B-AS
dogs I-AS
were O
cold O
in O
the O
middle O
and O
the O
buns B-AS
were O
stale O
. O

While O
the O
food B-AS
was O
excellent O
, O
it O
was O
n't O
cheap O
though O
not O
extremely O
expensive O
either O
. O

Beef B-AS

soup I-AS
is O
good O
as O
well O

I O
was O
so O
sad O
to O
read O
the O
bad O
reviews O
this O
place O
got O
! O

Delivery B-AS
service I-AS
is O
great O
too O
. O

The O
food B-AS

dazzling O
flavors B-AS
overwhelm O
the O
palate O
, O
truly O
embracing O
the O
beauty O
of O
authentic O
Thai B-AS
cuisine I-AS
. O

I O
recieved O
prompt O
service B-AS
with O
a O
smile O

They O
pray O
to O
their O
Food O
Gods O
to O
make O
them O
into O
a O
good O
pizza B-AS
like O
VT O

The O
place B-AS
was O
quiet O
and O
delightful O
. O

Molto O
bene O
! O

the O
best O
I O
' O
ve O
found O
outside O
of O
the O
Chinatown O
masters O
. O

They O
are O
amazing O
! O

Avoid O
this O
place O
! O

The O
food B-AS
is O
a O
diamond O
in O
rough O
- O
the O
food B-AS
is O
delicious O
and O
homemade O
with O
the O
perfect O
balance O
of O
herbs B-AS
and O
tomatoes B-AS
. O

A O
must O
try O
! O

As O
much O
as O
I O
like O
the O
food B-AS
there O
, O
I O
ca O
n't O
bring O
myself O
to O
go O
back O
. O

It O
looked O
like O
shredded B-AS
cheese I-AS
partly O
done O
, O
still O
in O
strips O
. O

The O
prices B-AS
and O
ambience B-AS
are O
especially O
great O
considering O
it O
's O
in O
the O
West O
Village O
. O

The O
soup B-AS
is O
pretty O
good O
too O
. O

It O
is O
so O
easy O
to O
get O
a O
reservation B-AS
at O
a O
top O
place O
in O
NYC O
with O
a O
week O
's O
notice O
. O

I O
have O
never O
better O
enjoyed O
humble O
root B-AS
vegetables I-AS
or O
a O
mushroom B-AS
consomme I-AS
, O
and O
this O
chef B-AS
accomplishes O
without O
fats O
. O

If O
you O
go O
to O
Roth O
's O
try O
to O
be O
served B-AS
by O
Mike O
, O
he O
is O
GREAT O
! O
! O

Based O
on O
a O
visit O
a O
month O
ago O
, O
I O
returned O
the O
week O
before O
Christmas O
and O
was O
hugely O
disappointed O
. O

Went O
here O
on O
a O
friend O
's O
reccomendation O
. O

not O
the O
food B-AS
, O
not O
the O
ambiance B-AS
, O
not O
the O
service B-AS
, O
I O
agree O
with O
the O
previous O
reviews O
you O
wait O
and O
wait O
, O
the O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
are O
very O
rude O
and O
when O
you O
get O
in O
they O
are O
looking O
to O
get O
you O
right O
out O
. O

I O
love O
Ess O
- O
a O
- O
bagel O
, O
but O
I O
live O
on O
the O
west O
side O
, O
so O
I O
often O
go O
to O
Murray O
's O
for O
convenience O
. O

I O
always O
get O
the O
Shabu B-AS
- I-AS
Shabu I-AS
dinner I-AS
and O
the O
beef B-AS
is O
always O
fresh O
. O

The O
pizza B-AS
was O
delivered O
cold O
and O
the O
cheese B-AS
was O
n't O
even O
fully O
melted O
! O

We O
were O
very O
surprised O
by O
how O
good O
the O
food B-AS
was O
on O
our O
first O
visit O
here O
on O
a O
Sunday O
night O
. O

Nha O
Trang O
, O
while O
being O
notorious O
for O
utter O
lack O
of O
comfort B-AS
and O
decor B-AS
, O
horribly O
slow O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
and O
horribly O
quick O
meals B-AS
, O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
vietnamese O
restaurants O
i O
' O
ve O
ever O
been O
to O
the O
pho B-AS
is O
delicious O
and O
comes O
with O
very O
fresh O
vegtables B-AS
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
if O
you O
are O
not O
fooled O
easily O
, O
you O
will O
find O
hundreds O
of O
restaurants O
that O
will O
give O
you O
service B-AS
and O
ambiance B-AS
that O
is O
on O
par O
with O
Alain O
Ducasse O
, O
and O
food B-AS
that O
will O
outshine O
in O
presentaion B-AS
, O
taste B-AS

choice B-AS
, O
quality B-AS
and O
quantity B-AS

We O
will O
definitely O
go O
back O

I O
live O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
and O
my O
friends O
meet O
me O
down O
here O
not O
only O
for O
the O
bar B-AS
scene I-AS
but O
also O
the O
promise O
of O
The O
Pizza O
Place O
at O
3 O
am O
. O

Is O
just O
the O
way O
it O
was O
in O
days O
gone O
by O
. O

If O
I O
could O
rate O
the O
people B-AS
this O
place O
would O
be O
off O
the O
charts O
, O
unfortunately O
, O
the O
pizza B-AS
, O
sorry O
, O
not O
the O
best O
in O
NYC O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
amazing O
! O
! O
! O
! O

Having O
not O
been O
home O
in O
the O
last O
2 O
years O
may O
skew O
this O
reviewer O
a O
bit O
, O
but O
the O
food B-AS
was O
tasty O
and O
spicy O
sans O
the O
oil B-AS
that O
comes O
floating O
along O
at O
similar O
venues O
. O

The O
portions B-AS
are O
now O
very O
small O
, O
the O
sauces B-AS
are O
overly O
- O
ambitious O
usually O
inedible O
while O
the O
service B-AS
is O
still O
good O
, O
the O
restaurant O
, O
due O
to O
its O
popularity O
, O
seems O
frantic O
. O

For O
the O
price B-AS
, O
you O
can O
not O
eat O
this O
well O
in O
Manhattan O
. O

The O
owner B-AS
is O
very O
friendly O
and O
a O
great O
guy O
, O
go O
try O
his O
pizza B-AS
, O
you O
'll O
like O
it O
! O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
great O
! O
! O
! O

It O
can O
be O
a O
very O
fun O
experience O
with O
a O
group O
, O
and O
kids O
6 O
and O
over O
would O
love O
it O
. O

With O
so O
many O
good O
restaurants O
on O
the O
UWS O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
need O
overpriced O
food B-AS
, O
absurdly O
arrogant O
wait B-AS
- I-AS
staff I-AS
who O
do O
n't O
recognize O
they O
work O
at O
a O
glorified O
diner B-AS
, O
clumsy O
service B-AS
, O
and O
management B-AS
that O
does O
n't O
care O
. O

I O
tend O
to O
judge O
a O
sushi O
restaurant O
by O
its O
sea B-AS
urchin I-AS
, O
which O
was O
heavenly O
at O
sushi O
rose O
. O

The O
service B-AS
is O
a O
little O
scatty O
at O
times O
but O
all O
is O
forgiven O
when O
the O
food B-AS
arrives O
. O

The O
bruscetta B-AS
is O
a O
bit O
soggy O
, O
but O
the O
salads B-AS
were O
fresh O
, O
included O
a O
nice O
mix B-AS
of I-AS
greens I-AS
not O
iceberg B-AS
all O
dishes B-AS
are O
served B-AS
piping O
hot O
from O
the O
kitchen O
. O

And O
evaluated O
on O
those O
terms O
Pastis O
is O
simply O
wonderful O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
n't O
the O
greatest O
, O
but O
I O
suppose O
that O
's O
how O
they O
keep O
the O
prices B-AS
down O
. O

The O
pickles B-AS
were O
great O
addition O
. O

If O
your O
favorite O
Chinese B-AS
food I-AS
is O
General B-AS
Tao I-AS
chicken I-AS
, O
then O
this O
is O
NOT O
your O
place O
. O

You O
must O
try O
the O
shrimp B-AS
appetizers I-AS
. O

Not O
only O
is O
the O
cuisine B-AS
the O
best O
around O
, O
the O
service B-AS
has O
always O
been O
attentive O
and O
charming O
. O

Filled O
with O
suits O
, O
though O
, O
so O
you O
never O
really O
feel O
terribly O
comfortable O
. O

The O
production O
is O
a O
symphony O
, O
alot O
of O
fun O
to O
experienceThe O
food B-AS
sublime O
for O
the O
most O
part O
. O

Waiters B-AS
tend O
to O
forget O
drinks B-AS
completely O
, O
food B-AS
portions I-AS
are O
so O
tiny O
, O
two O
people O
have O
trouble O
sharing O
one O
entree B-AS
. O

my O
wife O
and O
i O
have O
been O
going O
to O
nyc O
for O
years O
and O
would O
n't O
miss O
roxy O
, O
s O
food O
is O
expensive O
but O
it O

It O
's O
like O

transported O
to O
the O
Italian O
countryside O
, O
very O
romantic O
and O
filled O
with O
antiques O
. O

The O
cold B-AS
appetizer I-AS
dishes I-AS
taste O
like O
the O
way O
I O
remember O
them O
to O
taste O
when O
I O
was O
growing O
up O
in O
Taiwan O
. O

Just O
go O
and O
see O
for O
yourself O
. O

The O
restaurant O
was O
packed O
at O
first O
, O
so O
we O
waited O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
for O
about O
20 O
minutes O
before O
we O
were O
seated O
. O

Interesting O
selection O
, O
good O
wines B-AS
, O
service B-AS
fine O
, O
fun O
decor B-AS
. O

I O
hate O
this O
. O

Any O
if O
you O
have O
a O
reservation B-AS
you O
'll O
wait O
for O
max O
5 O
minutes O
, O
so O
have O
a O
drink B-AS
at O
the O
bar B-AS
. O

Whether O
it O
's O
the O
parmesean B-AS
porcini I-AS
souffle I-AS
or O
the O
lamb B-AS
glazed I-AS
with I-AS
balsamic I-AS
vinegar I-AS
, O
you O
will O
surely O
be O
transported O
to O
Northern O
Italy O
with O
one O
bite O
. O

That O
place O
was O
awesome O
, O
, O
, O
sally O
! O

The O
food B-AS
at O
this O
place O
is O
' B-AS
gourmet I-AS
' I-AS
Indian I-AS
cuisine I-AS
. O

Finally O
a O
reliable O
Chinese O
restaurant O
! O

get O
over O
it O
! O

But O
the O
thing O
that O
my O
wife O
and O
I O
hated O
was O
it O
was O
so O
loud O
and O
it O
felt O
like O
bar B-AS
or O
pub B-AS
' O
. O

However O
, O
it O
just O
so O
happens O
that O
there O
's O
an O
even O
more O
amazing O
place O
just O
down O
the O
street O
. O

While O
there O
are O
plenty O
of O
places O
to O
go O
for O
a O
good O
corned B-AS
beef I-AS
sandwich I-AS
, O
Katz O
's O
has O
a O
charm O
about O
it O
. O

However O
, O
looking O
at O
the O
table O
next O
to O
ours O
, O
we O
both O
sort O
of O
wished O
we O
had O
ordered O
pizza B-AS
, O
which O
looked O
PERRRRRRRRRFECT O
. O

Priced B-AS
at O
upper O
intermediate O
range O
. O

The O
fish O
was O
adequate O
, O
but O
inexpertly O
sliced O
. O

I O
recommend O
ordering O
in O
on O
a O
weeknight O
. O

If O
you O
live O
in O
new O
york O
city O
, O
you O
'll O
find O
better O
food B-AS
at O
small O
restaurants O
outside O
of O
time O
square O
and O
spend O
half O
the O
amount B-AS
. O

Try O
the O
olive B-AS
cream I-AS
cheese I-AS
or O
the O
lox B-AS
spread I-AS
on O
a O
whole O
wheat O
everything O
bagel B-AS
. O

While O
it O
's O
not O
Nobu O
, O
it O
sure O
is O
a O
great O
deal O
and O
you O
definitely O
will O
leave O
feeling O
satisfied O
and O
full O
. O

So O
my O
husband O
made O
up O
an O
excuse O
so O
we O
can O
leave O
. O

It O
's O
very O
spicy O
but O
not O
offensive O
. O

they O
did O
n't O
disappoint O
, O
service B-AS
from O
the O
second O
i O
arrived O
at O
the O
door O
was O
extremely O
pleasant O
and O
attentive O
with O
almost O
one O
server B-AS
per O
table B-AS
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
who O
they O
think O
they O
are O
but O
they O
have O
no O
respect O
for O
the O
residents O
of O
the O
neighborhood O
ever O
since O
they O
opened O
their O
cabaret O
next O
door O
and O
blasts O
loud O
music B-AS
till O
three O
in O
the O
morning O
every O
weekend O
during O
the O
summer O
. O

The O
rice B-AS
to I-AS
fish I-AS
ration I-AS
was O
also O
good O
-- O
they O
did O
n't O
try O
to O
overpack O
the O
rice B-AS
. O

They O
used O
shredded B-AS
cheese I-AS
on O
top O
! O

They O
are O
located O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
Chinatown O
! O

The O
food B-AS
is O
great O
and O
they O
have O
a O
good O
selecion B-AS
of I-AS
wines I-AS
at O
reasonable O
prices B-AS
. O

Eating O
at O
Ottimo O
is O
like O
eating O
in O
Chef O
Salvatore O
Esposito O
's O
home O
. O

Katz O
's O
deli O
is O
a O
great O
NY O
experience O
. O

Check O
it O
out O
. O

The O
only O
positive O
was O
the O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
, O
which O
was O
prompt O
, O
knowledgable O
, O
and O
likeable O
. O

I O
could O
n't O
reccommend O
their O
Godmother B-AS
pizza I-AS
any O
higher O
. O

I O
am O
not O
a O
vegetarian O
but O
, O
almost O
all O
the O
dishes B-AS
were O
great O
. O

I O
was O
very O
impressed O
by O
this O
low O
- O
key O
upper O
eastsider O
and O
their O
authentically O
thai B-AS
cuisine I-AS
! O
! O
! O

i O
would O
go O
again O
if O
i O
did O
n't O
have O
to O
pay O
. O

For O
the O
location B-AS
, O
the O
prices B-AS
are O
very O
reasonable O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
okay O
and O
the O
prices B-AS
here O
are O
mediocre O
. O

My O
friend O
's O
food B-AS
was O
also O
the O
complete O
opposite O
of O
what O
it O
's O
supposed O
to O
taste O
like O
aND O
look O
like O
. O

I O
ordered O
the O
crab B-AS
cocktail I-AS
and O
it O
was O
soaked O
in O
a O
lime B-AS
juice I-AS
concoction I-AS
where O
all O
you O
could O
taste O
was O
the O
lime B-AS
. O

I O
would O
like O
to O
return O
and O
try O
some O
of O
the O
other O
menu B-AS
items I-AS
when O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
rush O
off O
to O
a O
show O
. O

We O
have O
been O
to O
this O
place O
many O
times O
, O
and O
always O
have O
great O
food B-AS
, O
wine B-AS
, O
and O
service B-AS
. O

Hopefully O
next O
time O
, O
I O
will O
save O
room O
for O
dessert B-AS
. O

Alain O
Ducasse O
is O
the O
best O
of O
everything O
, O
I O
mean O
everything O
was O
excelentI O
. O

Not O
a O
typical O
pizza O
joint O
, O
but O
good O
for O
a O
low O
key O
and O
fairly O
cheap O
nice O
sit O
down O
dinner B-AS
. O

The O
corned B-AS
beef I-AS
was O
tender O
and O
melted O
in O
my O
mouth O
. O

GO O
HERE O
. O

The O
best O
Chicken B-AS
pad I-AS
tai I-AS
, O
I O
' O
ve O
ever O
had O
. O

We O
were O
n't O
even O
at O
our O
table O
for O
more O
than O
an O
hour O
total O
. O

$ O
20 O
for O
all O
you O
can O
eat O
sushi B-AS
can O
not O
be O
beaten O
. O

It O
has O
been O
my O
first O
choice O
ever O
since O
I O
discovered O
it O
. O

Over O
100 O
different O
choices O
to O
create O
your O
own O
. O

Haru O
serves O
very O
fresh O
fish B-AS
, O
has O
a O
trendy O
, O
modern O
ambiance B-AS
, O
prime O
location B-AS
on O
Park O
Avenue O
South O
and O
friendly O
service B-AS
. O

Warm O
and O
friendly O
in O
the O
winter O
and O
terrific O
outdoor B-AS
seating I-AS
in O
the O
warmer O
months O
. O

Very O
romantic O
fires O
, O
I O
' O
ve O
literally O
spent O
hours O
at O
Lanterna O
, O
drinking O
wine B-AS
from O
their O
extensive O
wine B-AS
and O
enjoying O
the O
ambience B-AS
. O

We O
got O
a O
little O
tipsy O
from O
the O
sake B-AS
but O
is O
n't O
that O
what O
Saturday O
nights O
with O
the O
girlfriends O
are O
all O
about O
? O

I O
almost O
wanted O
to O
write O
a O
bad O
review O
, O
so O
no O
one O
would O
ever O
go O
here O
and O
I O
could O
have O
all O
the O
dumplings B-AS
to O
myself O
! O

After O
reading O
the O
posts O
, O
I O
was O
always O
skeptical O
to O
go O
to O
The O
Minnow O
, O
despite O
living O
in O
Park O
Slope O
. O

I O
loved O
it O
and O
will O
be O
back O
soon O
. O

Always O
a O
nice O
crowd B-AS
, O
but O
never O
loud O
. O

My O
turkey B-AS
burger I-AS
was O
not O
cooked O
at O
all O
, O
my O
friends O
salmon B-AS
was O
completely O
raw O
. O

The O
service O
is O
spotty O
, O
sometimes O
really O
friendly O
and O
sometimes O
barely O
there O
. O

Decor B-AS
is O
minimalist O
and O
clean O
, O
nothing O
to O
distract O
or O
commend O
. O

His O
drinks B-AS
are O
very O
inventive O
, O
delicious O
and O
classy O
. O

Great O
food B-AS
, O
great O
prices B-AS
, O
great O
service B-AS
. O

This O
is O
n't O
your O
corner O
Chinese B-AS
food I-AS
takeout O
. O

Awsome O
Pizza B-AS
especially O
the O
Margheritta B-AS
slice O
. O

This O
place B-AS
, O
however O
, O
has O
a O
lot O
less O
pretension O
than O
Joya O
and O
the O
Thai B-AS
food I-AS
is O
still O
above O
- O
average O
. O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
ate O
here O
after O
reading O
reviews O
here O
as O
well O
as O
hobokenicom O
. O

Try O
ordering O
from O
the O
regular O
menu B-AS
, O
then O
you O
would O
not O
regret O
! O

Told O
us O
to O
sit O
anywhere O
, O
and O
when O
we O
sat O
he O
said O
the O
table B-AS
was O
reserved O
. O

uni O
from O
maine O
vs O
california O
, O
sea O
vs O
freshwater O
eel B-AS
to O
get O
a O
good O
taste O
comparison O
. O

We O
started O
with O
lox B-AS
and O
mussels B-AS
the O
best O
i O
ve O
ever O
had O
, O
ever O
and O
had O
the O
cod B-AS
and O
trout B-AS
for O
dinner B-AS
. O

The O
crispy B-AS
chicken I-AS
was O
n't O
for O
us O
, O
though O
. O

JUST O
AWSOME O
. O

Food B-AS
is O
great O
. O

There O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
variety O
even O
for O
people O
who O
eat O
vegetarian O
like O
me O
. O

I O
recommend O
the O
meatballs B-AS
and O
caprese B-AS
salad I-AS
and O
the O
beans B-AS
on I-AS
toast I-AS
were O
a O
wonderful O
start O
to O
the O
meal B-AS
! O

This O
place B-AS
is O
incredibly O
tiny O
. O

I O
will O
definetely O
go O
back O
again O
and O
again O
, O
that O
's O
for O
sure O
! O
! O
! O

I O
did O
n't O
complain O
, O
I O
liked O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
so O
much O
. O

This O
is O
one O
of O
our O
all O
- O
time O
favorite O
. O

In O
reality O
to O
maximize O
potential O
diners B-AS
they O
were O
still O
taking O
phone O
reservations B-AS
and O
reallocating O
tables B-AS
of O
those O
waiting B-AS
in O
the O
lobby B-AS
. O

The O
wine B-AS
is O
always O
good O
, O
the O
tapas B-AS
are O
always O
yummy O
, O
especially O
with O
the O
warm O
pita B-AS
bread I-AS
. O

But O
when O
you O
are O
seated O
the O
waitresses B-AS
are O
great O
, O
they O
explain O
everything O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
and O
the O
price B-AS
of O
the O
food B-AS
is O
really O
cheap O
for O
the O
service B-AS
you O
get O
. O

this O
place O
is O
amazingly O
bad O
. O

Compared O
to O
other O
shabu O
restaurants O
around O
town O
, O
this O
places O
wins O
hands O
- O
down O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
been O
to O
several O
places O
for O
Dim B-AS
Sum I-AS
and O
this O
has O
got O
to O
be O
the O
WORST O
. O

I O
love O
this O
place O
. O

The O
freshest O
, O
best O
variety B-AS
, O
and O
the O
fastest O
delivery B-AS
. O

Go O
to O
Volare O
for O
1st O
class O
service B-AS
and O
terrific O
food B-AS
. O

It O
's O
super O
- O
trendy O
and O
there O
's O
always O
someone O
to O
take O
that O
empty O
seat B-AS
, O
so O
it O
seems O
that O
customer O
service B-AS
has O
been O
deemed O
not O
of O
the O
essence O
. O

Dinner B-AS
took O
almost O
4 O
hours O
without O
any O
lag O
time O
. O

The O
people B-AS
in O
the O
restaurant O
were O
pretty O
obnoxious O
and O
loud O
. O

The O
sandwiches B-AS
are O
dry O
, O
tasteless O
and O
way O
overpriced O
. O

The O
problem O
is O
just O
that O
- O
it O
is O
a O
sometimes O
kind O
of O
affair O
. O

Price B-AS
no O
more O
than O
a O
Jersey O
deli O
but O
way O
better O
. O

The O
fried B-AS
rice I-AS
is O
really O
good O
too O
. O

We O
were O
well O
attended O
to O
by O
the O
enthusiastic O
staff B-AS
especially O
the O
manager B-AS
Tony O
Gaskin O
who O
made O
excellent O
suggestions O
for O
our O
menu B-AS
selections I-AS
. O

Made O
my O
dining B-AS
experience I-AS
uncomfortable O
. O

It O
's O
a O
steal O
! O

We O
went O
to O
this O
restaurant O
based O
on O
prior O
internet O
comments O
. O

still O
stay O
away O
, O
the O
table O
next O
to O
us O
walked O
out O
after O
my O
table O
and O
aanother O
were O
serves B-AS
eventhough O
they O
were O
there O
much O
longer O
. O

I O
was O
with O
a O
party O
of O
7 O
close O
but O
not O
next O
the O
the O
front B-AS
doors I-AS
and O
we O
were O
eating O
with O
our O
coats O
on O
. O

A O
very O
inviting O
restaurant O
, O
with O
friendly O
service B-AS
. O

THe O
back B-AS
garden I-AS
sitting I-AS
area I-AS
is O
very O
pleasant O
, O
where O
you O
can O
see O
their O
personal B-AS
herb I-AS
garden I-AS
. O

What O
's O
the O
difference O
between O
the O
two O
? O

Will O
go O
back O
but O
only O
sate O
those O
homesick O
stomach O
cravings O
! O

Good O
French O
restaurant O
in O
an O
area O
devoid O
of O
decent O
restaurants O
unless O
you O
're O
into O
eating O
4 O
pound O
pastrami B-AS
sandwiches I-AS
at O
Katz O
Deli O
, O
or O
Mexican B-AS
food I-AS
which O
is O
supplied O
by O
capable O
restaurants O
. O

I O
was O
very O
disappointed O
with O
this O
restaurant O
. O

The O
drinks B-AS
are O
always O
welll O
made O
and O
wine B-AS
selection I-AS
is O
fairly O
priced B-AS
. O

We O
also O
had O
shared O
a O
house B-AS
salad I-AS
that O
was O
fresh O
. O

The O
ceiling B-AS
is O
amazing O
! O

My O
wife O
and O
I O
were O
in O
NYC O
celebrating O
our O
30th O
anniversary O
. O

I O
' O
m O
glad O
I O
was O
introduced O
to O
this O
place O
and O
this O
is O
a O
rare O
gem O
in O
NY O
. O

And O
at O
the O
conclusion O
of O
this O
culinary O
nightmare O
the O
check B-AS
was O
given O
to O
our O
table B-AS
by O
knocking O
over O
a O
glass B-AS
of I-AS
water I-AS
. O

Not O
a O
small O
feat O
for O
good O
french B-AS
food I-AS
in O
the O
area O
. O

The O
space B-AS
is O
a O
bit O
too O
small O
for O
live B-AS
music I-AS
, O
so O
on O
jazz B-AS
nights I-AS
, O
it O
can O
be O
loud O
and O
cramped O
. O

Food B-AS
was O
average O
but O
tasty O
. O

We O
come O
from O
New O
Jersey O
to O
eat O
at O
Kinoko O
. O

Big O
Wong O
gets O
big O
Ups O
for O
a O
fine O
establishment B-AS
. O

Will O
never O
be O
back O
. O

The O
entree B-AS
was O
bland O
and O
small O
, O
dessert B-AS
was O
not O
inspired O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
it O
. O

Oh O
and O
it O
's O
too O
tiny O
for O
families O
with O
strollers O
. O

The O
staff B-AS
was O
the O
friendliest O
that O
have O
seen O
in O
New O
York O
. O

With O
the O
exception O
of O
our O
lemon B-AS
salad I-AS
that O
had O
so O
much O
pepper B-AS
on O
it O
that O
our O
eyes O
started O
watering O
, O
the O
food B-AS
here O
was O
decent O
, O
not O
great O
. O

The O
Pad O
thai O
, O
lad O
nar O
and O
various O
other O
dishes O
all O
look O
good O
on O
paper O
but O
, O
I O
' O
ve O
had O
better O
thai B-AS
food I-AS
in O
less O
asthetically O
pleasing O
places B-AS
. O

Delicious O
food B-AS
at O
a O
great O
price B-AS
but O
do O
not O
go O
here O
on O
a O
cold O
day O
and O
sit O

Overall O
, O
I O
' O
m O
still O
impressed O
that O
the O
place O
even O
exists O
and O
the O
prices B-AS
are O
quite O
decent O
but O
then O
again O
, O
its O
Chinatown O
. O

Admittedly O
some O
nights O
inside O
the O
restaurant O
were O
rather O
warm O
, O
but O
the O
open B-AS
kitchen I-AS
is O
part O
of O
the O
charm O
. O

My O
six O
year O
old O
loved O
it O
. O

Pizza B-AS
was O
a O
little O
soggy O
. O

The O
food B-AS
inludes O
famous O
scrumptious O
bombay B-AS
style I-AS
chaat I-AS
such O
as O
bhelpuri B-AS
, O
sevpuri B-AS
and O
samosa B-AS
chaats I-AS
, O
as O
well O
as O
other O
great O
indian B-AS
appetizers I-AS
. O

The O
Singapore B-AS
Mai I-AS
Fun I-AS
had O
NO O
curry B-AS
flavor I-AS
whatsoever O
. O

The O
only O
problem O
is O
that O
the O
manager B-AS
is O
a O
complete O
incompetent O
. O

The O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
is O
interesting O
and O
has O
many O
good O
values O
. O

Murray O
wo O
n't O
do O
it O
. O

I O
' O
m O
still O
mad O
that O
i O
had O
to O
pay O
for O
lousy O
food B-AS
. O

This O
restaurant O
used O
to O
be O
our O
regular O
Thursday O
night O
dinner B-AS
location I-AS
. O

Definite O
go O
if O
you O
're O
used O
to O
good O
Indian B-AS
restaurant I-AS
food I-AS
from O
abroad O
. O

THR O
AT B-AS
MOSHPHERE I-AS
IS O
COMPACT O
, O
MODERN O
, O
YET O
COZY O
. O

By O
far O
, O
the O
best O
pizza B-AS
in O
Manhattan O
. O

Decent O
Thai B-AS
food I-AS
in O
cute O
, O
though O
a O
bit O
dank O
, O
little O
Nolita O
hangout O
, O
BUT O
service B-AS
terrible O
. O

Most O
people O
eat O
there O
seem O
to O
be O
typical O
Upper O
East O
Side O
snobs O
, O
so O
be O
aware O
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
actually O
poured O
water B-AS
on O
my O
hand O
and O
walked O
away O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
mostly O
made O
from O
scratch O
, O
fresh O
and O
well O
prepared O
. O

Worse O
of O
all O
, O
$ O
60 O
was O
erroneously O
added O
to O
our O
$ O
80 O
bill B-AS
. O

Too O
cold O
to O
enjoy O
. O

NO O
more O
reservations B-AS
, O
expensive O
tips B-AS
and O
annoying O
stuff B-AS
. O

Try O
the O
sea B-AS
bass I-AS
. O

$ O
20 O
gets O
you O
unlimited O
sushi B-AS
of O
a O
very O
high O
quality B-AS
I O
even O
took O
a O
friend O
here O
from O
Japan O
who O
said O
it O
was O
one O
of O
the O
best O
sushi B-AS
places O
in O
the O
US O
that O
he O
has O
been O
to O
. O

I O
brought O
some O
buddies O
from O
CA O
and O
they O
loved O
it O
. O

Inside O
is O
a O
little O
cramped O
, O
but O
to O
be O
expected O
. O

Sushi B-AS
was O
n't O
anything O
spectacular O
for O
the O
price B-AS
. O

During O
our O
meal B-AS
, O
the O
management B-AS
came O
over O
and O
checked O
on O
us O
and O
even O
bought O
us O
a O
round B-AS
of I-AS
drinks I-AS
. O

But O
they O
do O
n't O
have O
a O
toaster B-AS
, O
which O
is O
strange O
. O

So O
, O
for O
good O
food B-AS
i O
'd O
recommend O
it O
, O
but O
not O
for O
a O
fun O
night O
out O
. O

The O
menu B-AS
choices I-AS
are O
similar O
but O
the O
taste B-AS
lacked O
more O
flavor B-AS
than O
it O
looked O
. O

A O
must O
for O
all O
the O
Dosa B-AS
lovers O
. O

The O
portions B-AS
are O
HUGE O
, O
so O
it O
might O
be O
good O
to O
order O
three O
things O
to O
split O
rather O
than O
one O
appetizer B-AS
and O
entree B-AS
per O
person O
for O
two O
people O
. O

The O
appetizers B-AS
are O
just O
OK O
and O
the O
main B-AS
courses I-AS
were O
decidedly O
subpar O
. O

Someone O
else O
recommended O
the O
dessert B-AS
, O
we O
also O
left O
that O
. O

The O
exotic B-AS
food I-AS
is O
beautifully O
presented O
and O
is O
a O
delight O
in O
delicious O
combinations O
. O

The O
staff B-AS
is O
very O
attentive O
and O
we O
can O
almost O
always O
get O
a O
table B-AS
. O

If O
you O
are O
a O
vegetarian O
, O
this O
really O
is O
n't O
a O
good O
place O
to O
go O
. O

Try O
the O
mediterranean B-AS
salad I-AS
, O
it O
is O
a O
true O
experience O
for O
your O
taste O
buds O
! O
! O

I O
' O
m O
sure O
I O
'll O
return O
for O
a O
final O
judgement O
tho O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
it O
is O
crowded O
but O
who O
cares O
. O

This O
quaint O
and O
romantic O
trattoria O
is O
at O
the O
top O
of O
my O
Manhattan O
restaurant O
list O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
been O
there O
three O
times O
and O
have O
always O
had O
wonderful O
experiences O
. O

People B-AS
are O
always O
friendly O
. O

The O
cream B-AS
cheeses I-AS
are O
out O
of O
this O
world O
and O
I O
love O
that O
coffee B-AS
! O
! O

From O
the O
entrees B-AS
to O
the O
sides B-AS
to O
the O
drinks B-AS
, O
everything O
was O
creatively O
prepared O
yet O
still O
simple O
. O

hmmm O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
prompt O
and O
courteous O
. O

It O
was O
not O
above O
ordinary O
and O
the O
beef B-AS
version I-AS
had O
cheap O
undercooked O
beef B-AS
. O

Chance O
is O
a O
small O
cozy O
restaurant O
, O
with O
a O
romantic O
feel O
to O
it O
, O
the O
decor B-AS
is O
great O
. O

It O
was O
nice O
and O
fresh O
, O
but O
I O
ca O
n't O
give O
it O
high O
scores O
on O
being O
authentic O
thai B-AS
. O

Overall O
, O
worht O
every O
penny O
. O

When O
I O
called O
this O
morning O
, O
I O
did O
n't O
think O
I O
would O
be O
able O
to O
get O
in O
at O
12 O
, O
but O
I O
was O
able O
to O
get O
in O
, O
along O
with O
four O
other O
guests O
. O

Got O
club B-AS
soda I-AS
, I-AS
filled I-AS
with I-AS
ice I-AS
, I-AS
no I-AS
lime I-AS
. O

Only O
wine B-AS
and O
beer B-AS
are O
served B-AS
, O
but O
the O
house B-AS
varities I-AS
are O
actually O
quite O
good O
. O

This O
place O
must O
have O
cost B-AS
the O
owners B-AS
afortune O
to O
build O
. O

My O
mouth O
starts O
to O
water O
merely O
thinking O
about O
the O
delight O
that O
is O
this O
restaurant O
. O

I O
have O
n't O
been O
to O
the O
other O
locations O
. O

Oh O
, O
and O
the O
complimentary O
pudding B-AS
dessert I-AS
was O
just O
enough O
yummy O
! O

People O
dress O
in O
suits O
or O
evening O
gowns O
as O
well O
as O
shirts O
jeans O
. O

we O
split O
a O
tasty O
vegetable B-AS
samosa I-AS
and O
the O
malai B-AS
tikka I-AS
wrap I-AS
. O

Knowledge O
of O
the O
chef B-AS
and O
the O
waitress B-AS
are O
below O
average O
. O

We O
were O
walking O
around O
the O
village O
and O
went O
into O
this O
place O
just O
for O
some O
drinks B-AS
. O

Decent O
wine B-AS
selection I-AS
too O
. O

Go O
with O
a O
group O
of O
friends O
and O
you O
will O
have O
a O
great O
time O
. O

It O
saves O
walking O
in O
and O
waiting B-AS
for O
a O
table B-AS
in O
the O
often O
noisy O
, O
crowded O
bar B-AS
at O
dinnertime O
. O

I O
have O
to O
say O
I O
have O
never O
had O
a O
disapointing O
meal B-AS
here O
. O

It O
's O
one O
of O
our O
favorite O
places O
to O
eat O
in O
NY O
. O

The O
place O
does O
get O
crowded O
, O
so O
I O
recommend O
going O
between O
4 O
- O
5 O
PM O
. O

Mine O
was O
a O
little O
burnt O
but O
still O
delicious O
with O
goat B-AS
cheese I-AS
and O
panchetta B-AS
raddichio I-AS
was O
kind O
of O
bitter O
though O
. O

Disappointing O
food B-AS
, O
lousy O
service B-AS
. O

I O
' O
m O
from O
sichuan O
, O
this O
is O
the O
restaurant O
I O
recommend O
going O
. O

This O
lovely O
French O
- O
Asian O
fusion O
restaurant O
stands O
out O
amongst O
other O
great O
restaurants O
on O
Smith O
Street O
. O

If O
you O
want O
a O
casual O
neighborhood O
bistro O
that O
has O
great O
food B-AS
and O
excellent O
service B-AS
, O
this O
is O
the O
place O
. O

great O
place O
to O
go O
for O
a O
drink B-AS
too O
because O
they O
have O
100 O
kinds B-AS
of I-AS
beer I-AS
. O

But O
this O
place O
is O
a O
well O
- O
oiled O
machine O
so O
they O
know O
what O
they O
're O
doing O
. O

Over O
price B-AS
, O
and O
small O
portions B-AS
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
the O
bartender B-AS
continued O
to O
pour O
champagne B-AS
from O
his O
reserve O
after O
we O
had O
finished O
our O
bottle O
and O
we O
enjoyed O
an O
amuse O
of O
turnip B-AS
soup I-AS
with I-AS
pureed I-AS
basil I-AS
, O
gratis O
. O

But O
I O
'd O
go O
back O

Stepped O
on O
my O
foot O
on O
the O
SECOND O
time O
he O
reached O
over O
me O
to O
adjust O
lighting O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
well O
prepared O
and O
the O
service B-AS
impecable O
. O

BUt O
their O
best O
dish B-AS
is O
thh O
Thai B-AS
spiced I-AS
curry I-AS
noodles I-AS
with I-AS
shrimp I-AS
, O
a O
dish B-AS
that O
would O
cost B-AS
$ O
2395 O
is O
most O
places O
, O
but O
it O
is O
$ O
16 O
here O
. O

Good O
, O
dark O
atmosphere B-AS
and O
the O
music B-AS
is O
a O
nice O
touch O
. O

My O
husband O
said O
the O
portions B-AS
were O
very O
small O
, O
but O
if O
my O
main B-AS
course I-AS
was O
good O
to O
eat O
the O
portion B-AS
would O
' O
ve O
been O
fine O
for O
me O
. O

But O
the O
thai B-AS
is O
definitely O
not O
great O
- O
bland O
and O
indistinguished O
. O

This O
Thai O
restaurant O
is O
a O
couple O
blocks O
away O
from O
Sripraphai O
another O
delicious O
Thai O
restaurant O
. O

Great O
for O
groups O
, O
great O
for O
a O
date O
, O
great O
for O
early O
brunch B-AS
or O
a O
nightcap B-AS
. O

Authentic O
Shanghai O
style O
and O
I O
can O
not O
recommend O
a O
better O
Shanghai O
place O
in O
New O
York O
. O

Our O
friendly O
server B-AS
made O
great O
food B-AS
suggestions I-AS
and O
also O
sent O
both O
the O
sommelier B-AS
and O
the O
fromager B-AS
to O
the O
table O
to O
help O
suggest O
different O
pairings O
for O
wine B-AS
and O
cheese B-AS
. O

Perhaps O
the O
last O
reviewer O
who O
stated O
she O
was O
treated O
with O
attitude O
lives O
in O
a O
parallel O
universe O
because O
I O
have O
never O
had O
anything O
but O
a O
perfect O
experience O
at O
Yasuda O
. O

That O
said O
, O
I O
thought O
Scalini O
Fedeli O
was O
one O
of O
the O
best O
dining O
experiences O
I O
' O
ve O
EVER O
had O
. O

Everything O
about O
this O
restaurant O
was O
special O
. O

Because O
we O
did O
n't O
have O
a O
reservation B-AS
, O
we O
could O
only O
sit O
in O
the O
back B-AS
garden I-AS
, O
but O
it O
was O
great O
, O
secluded O
and O
perfect O
in O
nice O
weather O
. O

Stuffing O
yourself O
with O
Japanese B-AS
food I-AS
is O
a O
rare O
thing O
. O

I O
try O
my O
best O
to O
give O
an O
accurate O
description O
of O
any O
establishment O
visited O
. O

While O
the O
food B-AS
was O
good O
certainly O
no O
Il O
Mulino O
the O
service B-AS
was O
horrendous O
. O

It O
is O
expensive O
but O
well O
worth O
the O
money O
. O

Service B-AS
is O
not O
what O
one O
would O
expect O
from O
a O
joint O
in O
this O
price B-AS
category I-AS
. O

Our O
family O
never O
expected O
such O
incredible O
entertainment B-AS
in O
a O
restaurant O
. O

i O
would O
recommend O
reservations B-AS
on O
weekends O
though O
. O

There O
are O
many O
Thai O
places O
in O
the O
city O
but O
so O
far O
Toons O
is O
# O
1 O
. O

Great O
pizza B-AS
for O
lunch O
place O
. O

The O
food O
was O
very O
expensive O
we O
spent O
$ O
160 O
for O
lunch B-AS
for O
two O
but O
extremely O
tasty O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
I O
would O
go O
again O
. O

We O
were O
a O
group O
of O
8 O
and O
well O
seved B-AS
. O

And O
that O
's O
no O
mean O
feat O
. O

I O
often O
go O
there O
to O
eat O
with O
my O
family O
. O

I O
wish O
they O
would O
change O
back O
to O
what O
it O
was O
before O
. O

The O
signs B-AS
, O
the O
specials B-AS
menus I-AS
, O
food B-AS
, O
and O
even O
all O
the O
waitstaff B-AS
are O
ALL O
TOTALLY O
Japanese O
. O

NO O
PIZZA O
33 O
for O
me O
! O

I O
LOVE O
their O
spicy O
scallop B-AS
roll I-AS
, O
and O
my O
boyfriend O
consistently O
gets O
the O
sesame B-AS
chicken I-AS
. O

I O
' O
m O
no O
food B-AS
critic O
, O
but O
I O
'd O
like O
to O
think O
I O
have O
a O
tiny O
bit O
of O
experience O
under O
my O
belt O
having O
lived O
in O
NY O
for O
the O
last O
11 O
years O
. O

I O
noted O
it O
was O
crossed O
off O
on O
the O
bill B-AS
. O

Needless O
to O
say O
, O
I O
' O
m O
never O
going O
back O
and O
you O
should O
be O
wary O
too O
. O

Best O
dish B-AS
is O
nori B-AS
- I-AS
wrapped I-AS
tuna I-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
absolutely O
amazing O
! O
! O

Some O
servers B-AS
make O
you O
feel O
like O
they O
are O
doing O
you O
a O
favor O
to O
bring O
you O
the O
food B-AS
. O

An O
excellent O
alternative O
to O
fast B-AS
food I-AS
joints O
and O
ordering O
in O
but O
, O
the O
food B-AS
was O
slightly O
disappointing O
. O

Mermaid O
Inn O
is O
an O
overall O
good O
restaurant O
with O
really O
good O
seafood B-AS
. O

I O
work O
around O
the O
corner O
and O
tried O
it O
with O
a O
colleague O
for O
the O
first O
time O
. O

I O
went O
here O
with O
my O
boyfriend O
and O
another O
couple O
. O

The O
staff B-AS
is O
also O
attentive O
and O
friendly O
. O

The O
all B-AS
you I-AS
can I-AS
eat I-AS
deal I-AS
is O
truly O
amazing O
here O
. O

That O
is O
a O
problem O
since O
we O
paid O
about O
20 O
bucks O
a O
dish B-AS
, O
and O
had O
to O
order O
5 O
dish B-AS
to O
get O
a O
decent O
taste B-AS
. O

This O
is O
definitely O
a O
place O
that O
provides O
the O
best O
experience O
, O
though O
, O
to O
both O
A O
- O
listers O
and O
people O
walking O
in O
off O
the O
street O
. O

They O
were O
such O
a O
rip O
- O
off O
$ O
895 O
for O
four O
small O
meat B-AS
patties I-AS
in I-AS
steamed I-AS
buns I-AS
and O
not O
worth O
trying O
. O

first O
it O
took O
us O
a O
long O
time O
to O
find O
the O
place O
. O

All O
of O
the O
pizzas B-AS
are O
terrific O
and O
the O
price B-AS
is O
even O
better O
! O

It O
is O
about O
FOOD B-AS
and O
Ambiance B-AS
, O
and O
imagine O
how O
dreadful O
it O
will O
be O
it O
we O
only O
had O
to O
listen O
to O
an O
idle O
engine O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
good O
too O
. O

We O
have O
tried O
every O
Thai O
restaurant O
between O
Atlantic O
Avenue O
and O
4th O
Streets O
, O
and O
Joya O
is O
the O
best O
. O

Immediately O
after O
we O
paid O
, O
the O
waiter B-AS
took O
the O
money O
and O
said O
, O
okay O
, O
you O
guys O
are O
outta O
here O
. O

The O
dining B-AS
room I-AS
is O
quietly O
elegant O
with O
no O
music B-AS
to O
shout O
over O
- O
how O
refreshing O
! O

Admittedly O
, O
this O
is O
not O
the O
place O
for O
gigantic O
pieces O
of O
fish B-AS
overflowing O
the O
plate O
and O
thank O
goodness O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
but O
for O
simple O
, O
elegant O
sushi B-AS
there O
is O
no O
better O
place O
in O
New O
York O
or O
anywhere O
in O
the O
US O
. O

I O
am O
a O
die O
hard O
peep O
lover O
. O

Once O
you O
become O
a O
regular O
, O
you O
are O
treated O
as O
one O
. O

The O
menu B-AS
seemed O
to O
have O
a O
wide O
variety B-AS
of I-AS
dishes I-AS
for O
seafood B-AS
lovers O
and O
interesting O
ways O
of O
preparing O
them O
. O

Everyone O
treats O
you O
like O
you O
were O
part O
of O
the O
family O
. O

The O
white B-AS
bean I-AS
brushetta I-AS
to O
start O
was O
incredible O
and O
the O
pasta B-AS
was O
phenomenal O
. O

The O
rest O
of O
the O
menu O
is O
limited O
by O
everything O
is O
good O
eats B-AS
. O

The O
menu B-AS
is O
nothing O
like O
the O
one O
on O
the O
website O
. O

Great O
food B-AS
, O
great O
lay B-AS
out I-AS
and O
awesome O
service B-AS
. O

I O
ve O
asked O
a O
cart B-AS
attendant I-AS
for O
a O
lotus B-AS
leaf I-AS
wrapped I-AS
rice I-AS
and O
she O
replied O
back O
rice B-AS
and O
just O
walked O
away O
. O

SEA O
has O
become O
so O
popular O
that O
they O
' O
ve O
let O
it O
go O
to O
their O
heads O
. O

We O
walked O
in O
on O
a O
Wednesday O
night O
and O
were O
seated B-AS
promptly O
. O

Chennai O
Garden O
is O
my O
favorite O
Indian O
restaurant O
in O
the O
city O
. O

The O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
is O
very O
freindly O
, O
they O
make O
it O
feel O
like O
you O
're O
eating O
in O
a O
freindly O
little O
european O
town O
. O

Oh O
yeah O
ever O
on O
the O
west O
side O
try O
there O
sister O
resturant O
Arties O
Cafe O
. O

Besides O
that O
there O
should O
be O
more O
restaurants O
like O
it O
around O
the O
city O
. O

My O
roommate O
and O
I O
LOVE O
this O
place O
. O

The O
waitstaff B-AS
are O
all O
very O
busy O
, O
it O
's O
not O
outstanding O
service O
, O
but O
I O
' O
ve O
never O
been O
dealt O
with O
rudely O
. O

I O
have O
lived O
in O
Japan O
for O
7 O
years O
and O
the O
taste B-AS
of O
the O
food B-AS
and O
the O
feel B-AS
of O
the O
restaurant O
is O
like O
being O
back O
in O
Japan O
. O

Not O
worth O
it O
. O

In O
the O
evening O
, O
this O
place O
attracted O
a O
well O
dressed O
, O
with O
it O
, O
NY O
crowd O
. O

They O
have O
it O
all O
- O
great O
price B-AS
, O
food B-AS
, O
and O
service B-AS
. O

So O
close O
, O
but O
not O
good O
enough O
. O

This O
was O
on O
a O
Tuesday O
night O
. O

Its O
also O
a O
bit O
of O
a O
hassle O
to O
get O
to O
without O
a O
car O
I O
happen O
to O
live O
in O
Inwood O
. O

The O
flavors B-AS
are O
great O
, O
and O
the O
menu B-AS
is O
extensive O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
amazing O
, O
the O
service B-AS
was O
so O
attentive O
and O
personable O
, O
and O
how O
about O
that O
ambience B-AS
! O

This O
place B-AS
has O
the O
best O
interior B-AS
I O
have O
seen O
anywhere O
in O
the O
northside O
of O
W'burg O
, O
and O
will O
impress O
whoever O
you O
bring O
there O
. O

The O
food B-AS
has O
been O
consistant O
for O
years O
and O
it O
never O
lets O
you O
down O
. O

I O
found O
the O
variety O
of O
the O
sashimi B-AS
plate I-AS
to O
be O
satisfying O
, O
fresh O
and O
yummy O
. O

And O
forget O
what O
you O
read O
under O
me O
, O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
n't O
that O
bad O
either O
. O

Do O
n't O
waste O
your O
time O
, O
or O
money O
! O
! O

They O
do O
n't O
concern O
much O
of O
customer O
's O
health O
, O
just O
want O
to O
make O
money O
. O

We O
could O
n't O
carry O
our O
conversation O
as O
we O
were O
routinely O
interrupted O
by O
waitress B-AS
and O
servants B-AS
asking O
us O
to O
order O
and O
hinting O
that O
we O
're O
taking O
too O
much O
time O
- O
amazing O
, O
we O
just O
sat O
down O
. O

sometimes O
i O
get O
good O
food B-AS
and O
ok O
service B-AS
. O

We O
just O
ate O
at O
Kai O
and O
were O
disapointed O
. O

It O
's O
a O
place O
for O
people O
who O
pay O
a O
lot O
for O
mediocre O
food B-AS
, O
noise B-AS
and O
a O
chance O
to O
be O
with O
their O
fellow O
bridge O
and O
tunnel O
folks O
. O

This O
was O
a O
great O
surprise O
. O

After O
complaining O
about O
the O
chicken B-AS
dish I-AS
, O
the O
manager B-AS
came O
over O
to O
tell O
us O
that O
, O
no O
one O
had O
ever O
complained O
before O
, O
and O
that O
we O
just O
did O
n't O
know O
what O
the O
dish B-AS
was O
supposed O
to O
taste O
like O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
spicy O
and O
delicious O
. O

I O
went O
with O
my O
fiance O
on O
a O
Tuesday O
evening O
. O

A O
little O
overpriced O
but O
worth O
it O
once O
you O
take O
a O
bite O
. O

It O
was O
wonderful O
. O

Went O
for O
a O
late O
weekday O
lunch B-AS
. O

I O
just O
do O
n't O
understand O
all O
the O
hype O
. O

Bartender B-AS
was O
unable O
to O
tear O
himself O
away O
from O
friends O
at O
bar B-AS
. O

Anyways O
, O
if O
you O
're O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
to O
eat O
good O
food B-AS
, O
I O
would O
n't O
waste O
my O
time O
trying O
to O
find O
something O
, O
rather O
go O
across O
the O
street O
to O
Tamari O
. O

Dahkin O
also O
offers O
prix B-AS
fixe I-AS
lunch I-AS
and O
buffet B-AS
. O

Although O
the O
place O
could O
be O
a O
little O
more O
eye O
catching O
and O
roomier O
, O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
it O
does O
n't O
really O
matter O
. O

You O
can O
barely O
see O
who O
you O
are O
with O
never O
mind O
have O
a O
conversation O
. O

This O
was O
my O
frist O
time O
at O
Cafe O
St O
Bart O
's O
and O
I O
must O
say O
how O
delicous O
the O
food B-AS
and O
the O
service B-AS
was O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
get O
it O
either O
. O

Went O
on O
a O
double O
date O
with O
friend O
and O
his O
girlfriend O
for O
a O
few O
drinks B-AS
and O
appetizers B-AS
. O

Great O
place O
to O
grab O
a O
hot B-AS
bagel I-AS
on O
the O
way O
to O
work O
. O

It O
's O
like O
they O
took O
leftover O
chicken B-AS
, O
poured O
oil B-AS
and O
sprinkled O
pepper B-AS
powder I-AS
over O
it O
the O
sauce B-AS
was O
translucent O
and O
red O
. O

One O
would O
think O
we O
'd O
get O
an O
apology O
or O
complimentary O
drinks B-AS
, O
instead O
, O
we O
got O
a O
snobby O
waiter B-AS
would O
n't O
even O
take O
our O
order O
for O
15 O
minutes O
and O
gave O
us O
lip O
when O
we O
asked O
him O
to O
do O
so O
. O

One O
of O
my O
favorite O
places O
in O
Manhattan O
. O

They O
brought O
glasses O
and O
the O
bottle O
, O
and O
just O
left O
the O
bottle O
at O
our O
table O
. O

We O
actually O
gave O
10 O
% O
tip B-AS
which O
we O
have O
never O
done O
despite O
mediocre O
food B-AS
and O
service B-AS
, O
because O
we O
felt O
totally O
ripped O
off O
. O

We O
were O
looking O
forward O
to O
nice O
glass B-AS
of I-AS
Sangria I-AS
when O
we O
arrived O
. O

I O
would O
highly O
recommand O
requesting O
a O
table B-AS
by I-AS
the I-AS
window I-AS
. O

While O
we O
enjoyed O
the O
food B-AS
, O
we O
were O
highly O
disappointed O
by O
the O
poor O
service B-AS
waiter I-AS
was O
not O
quite O
competent O
and O
SLOW O
service B-AS
and O
lack O
of O
remorse O
. O

I O
for O
one O
will O
never O
patronize O
them O
again O
. O

I O
stumbled O
upon O
this O
great O
pizzeria O
as O
I O
explored O
my O
new O
neighborhood O
. O

After O
hearing O
a O
lot O
of O
great O
things O
about O
the O
restaurant O
, O
and O
passing O
by O
it O
on O
a O
daily O
basis O
, O
we O
decided O
to O
try O
. O

The O
service B-AS
, O
however O
, O
was O
a O
bright O
flower O
in O
a O
garden O
. O

So O
, O
again O
, O
give O
it O
a O
try O
. O

Stay O
far O
away O
from O
this O
place O
. O

We O
will O
come O
back O
! O
! O
! O

We O
' O
ve O
been O
to O
Grocery O
three O
times O
and O
not O
once O
has O
an O
item O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
disappointed O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
very O
good O
too O
but O
for O
the O
most O
part O
, O
it O
's O
just O
regular O
food B-AS
, O
nothing O
special O
. O

A O
touch O
more O
jalapeno B-AS
heat O
for O
contrast O
and O
it O
would O
have O
been O
very O
good O
indeed O
. O

Tried O
the O
pad B-AS
see I-AS
ew I-AS
on O
the O
recommendation O
of O
the O
last O
reviewer O
since O
it O
's O
one O
of O
my O
favorite O
dishes B-AS
. O

We O
'd O
go O
back O
again O

We O
ate O
out O
in O
the O
back B-AS
patio I-AS
, O
which O
is O
worth O
it O
as O
it O
's O
cool O
and O
the O
music B-AS
is O
hear O
well O
there O
. O

The O
location B-AS
is O
perfect O
. O

Guacamole+shrimp B-AS
appetizer I-AS
was O
really O
great O
, O
we O
both O
had O
the O
filet B-AS
, O
very O
good O
, O
did O
n't O
much O
like O
the O
frites B-AS
that O
came O
with O
, O
but O
the O
filet B-AS
was O
so O
good O
, O
neither O
of O
us O
cared O
. O

The O
lunch B-AS
special I-AS
is O
an O
asbolute O
steal O
. O

This O
food B-AS
is O
asian O
- O
air O
fusion O
. O

Nothing O
fancy O
but O
really O
good O
food B-AS
with O
pretty O
reasonable O
price B-AS
. O

The B-AS
chicken I-AS
pot I-AS
pie I-AS
is O
excpetiona O
, O
the O
cheeseburger B-AS
huge O
and O
delictable O
, O
and O
the O
service B-AS
professional O
wan O
warm O
. O

While O
I O
quite O
liked O
the O
food B-AS
and O
the O
ambience B-AS
, O
I O
' O
m O
not O
quite O
sure O
if O
it O
they O
really O
deserve O
it O
the O
Michelin O
rating O
they O
have O
displayed O
so O
prooudly O
in O
the O
window O
. O

i O
' O
m O
surprised O
about O
some O
of O
the O
bad O
reviews O
posted O
here O
, O
i O
' O
ve O
been O
to O
tamarind O
about O
5 O
or O
6 O
times O
and O
always O
come O
away O
extremely O
satisfied O
and O
looking O
forward O
to O
returning O
. O

But O
on O
a O
lazy O
Saturday O
night O
, O
we O
ended O
up O
going O
. O

There O
are O
a O
few O
Italian O
employees O
who O
may O
not O
speak O
the O
best O
English O
but O
for O
me O
that O
adds O
to O
the O
experience O
. O

I O
have O
never O
eaten O
in O
the O
restaurant O
, O
however O
, O
upon O
reading O
the O
reviews O
I O
got O
take O
out O
last O
week O
. O

Once O
for O
dinner B-AS
and O
once O
for O
brunch B-AS
. O

I O
' O
ve O
been O
to O
at O
Cafe O
Spice O
probably O
5 O
- O
8 O
times O
, O
it O
is O
probably O
still O
the O
best O
Indian O
restaurant O
around O
Union O
Square O
. O

Not O
worth O
the O
prices B-AS
. O

Would O
recommend O
, O
perfect O
for O
those O
looking O
for O
a O
place O
close O
to O
grand O
central O
. O

From O
the O
moment O
you O
enter O
till O
the O
moment O
you O
walk O
out O
the O
friendly O
and O
helpful O
staff B-AS
was O
was O
just O
Fantastic O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
good O
and O
food B-AS
is O
wonderful O
. O

I O
only O
have O
friends O
. O

She O
gets O
10 O
for O
her O
excellent O
service B-AS
and O
advice O
. O

The O
restaurant O
is O
a O
bit O
noisy O
but O
that O
is O
something O
that O
can O
be O
overlooked O
once O
you O
sit O
down O
and O
enjoy O
a O
great O
meal B-AS

being O
a O
fan O
of O
spicy B-AS
ethnic I-AS
foods I-AS
, O
indian O
included O
, O
i O
made O
friends O
with O
this O
place O
long O
ago O
. O

Please O
save O
yourself O
the O
frustration O
. O

And O
I O
say O
snacking B-AS
because O
it O
really O
is O
not O
set O
up O
to O
be O
a O
proper O
dinner B-AS
. O

The O
quality B-AS
of I-AS
food I-AS
at O
this O
restaurant O
accompanied O
by O
fantastic O
live B-AS
jazz I-AS
makes O
this O
place O
a O
perfect O
10 O
! O

I O
have O
eaten O
at O
Saul O
, O
many O
times O
, O
the O
food B-AS
is O
always O
consistently O
, O
outrageously O
good O
. O

Always O
ask O
the O
bartender B-AS
for O
the O
SEASONAL B-AS
beer I-AS
! O
! O
! O

If O
your O
visiting O
, O
you O
'll O
enjoy O
the O
ambiance B-AS
and O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
's O
in O
Time O
Sq O
. O

We O
were O
on O
our O
way O
back O
to O
NJ O
, O
and O
since O
I O
am O
in O
NY O
, O
we O
figured O
why O
not O
grab O
some O
food B-AS
? O

sandwiches O
tho O
pricey O
are O
over O
stuffed O
, O
can O
serve O
2 O
persons O
easily O
thus O
cost O
effective O
! O

And O
comparing O
it O
to O
the O
Chinatown O
restaurants O
is O
simply O
not O
fair O
. O

Service B-AS
and O
food B-AS
is O
what O
any O
one O
would O
expect O
when O
spending O
that O
type O
of O
money O
. O

LOVE O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
, O
felt O
like O
I O
was O
in O
Paris O
. O

Every O
course B-AS
was O
better O
than O
the O
next O
. O

Not O
cheap O
, O
but O
not O
that O
expensive O
either O
. O

The O
staff B-AS
is O
incredibly O
helpful O
and O
attentive O
. O

If O
presentation O
and O
service B-AS
is O
your O
thing O
, O
then O
this O
magic O
show O
works O
. O

Apparently O
, O
the O
good O
cook B-AS
works O
then O
. O

I O
was O
pleasantly O
suprised O
. O

The O
Yellowtail B-AS
was O
particularly O
good O
as O
well O
. O

One O
less O
manhattanite O
the O
better O
. O

Everyone O
is O
welcomed O
in O
as O
family O
. O

I O
ate O
clams B-AS
oreganta I-AS
and O
spectacular O
salad B-AS
with I-AS
perfectly I-AS
marinated I-AS
cucumbers I-AS
and I-AS
tomatoes I-AS
with I-AS
lots I-AS
of I-AS
shrimp I-AS
and I-AS
basil I-AS
. O

The O
menu B-AS
changed O
, O
portions B-AS
were O
even O
smaller O
than O
before O
, O
a O
lentil B-AS
dish I-AS
was O
salty O
beyond O
edibility O
, O
a O
basmati B-AS
rice I-AS
dish I-AS
lacked O
flavor B-AS
. O

Spice O
is O
sleek O
, O
modern O
and O
cool O
with O
a O
menu B-AS
that O
will O
not O
hurt O
your O
wallet O
. O

Patroon O
features O
a O
nice O
cigar B-AS
bar I-AS
and O
has O
great O
staff B-AS
. O

Hey O
, O
I O
think O
$ O
2 O
+ O
for O
a O
5 O
block O
walk O
ai O
n't O
bad O
. O

Very O
affordable O
and O
excellent O
ambient B-AS
! O

Look O
elsewhere O
. O

More O

My O
co O

had O
to O
wait O
almost O
an O
hour O
for O
delivery B-AS
, O
only O
to O
discover O
that O
what O
they O
got O
was O
not O
what O
they O
ordered O
. O

Worth O
a O
visit O
. O

A O
real O
dissapointment O
. O

Its O
a O
go O
- O
to O
for O
dates O
as O
well O
as O
entertaining B-AS
out O
of O

Why O
do O
people O

about O
the O
ambience B-AS
. O

Were O
meeting O
up O
with O
some O
friends O
for O
a O

Great O

If O
you O
're O
looking O
for O
a O
great O
meal B-AS
at O
a O
decent O
price B-AS
, O
go O
to O
Del O
Frisco O

! O

They O
charge O
$ O
600 O

My O
steak B-AS
au I-AS
poivre I-AS
was O
one O
of O
the O
worst O
I O
' O
ve O
had O
. O

On O
a O
recent O
Sunday O
afternoon O
, O
a O
friend O
and O
I O
accidently O
found O
this O
great O
restaurant O
on O
our O
way O
to O
see O
the O
pulitzer O
prize O
winning O
play O
DOUBT O
. O

The O
owner B-AS
and O
staff B-AS
are O
all O
Japanese O
as O
well O
and O
that O
adds O
to O
the O
entire O
ambiance B-AS
. O

Try O
the O
congee B-AS
and O
the O
donut B-AS
like I-AS
deep I-AS
fried I-AS
dough I-AS
they I-AS
call I-AS
Ow I-AS
Ley I-AS
Soh I-AS
, O
a O
delicious O
and O
sweet O
tasting O
bread B-AS
. O

Although O
the O
tables B-AS
may O
be O
closely O
situated O
, O
the O
candle B-AS
- I-AS
light I-AS
, O
food B-AS
- I-AS
quality I-AS
and O
service B-AS
overcompensate O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
delicious O
and O
the O
waiter B-AS
was O
incredibly O
helpful O
and O
attentive O
considering O
we O
were O
the O
only O
ones O
there O
for O
the O
first O
hour O
. O

From O
the O
spectacular O
caviar B-AS
to O
the O
hospitable O
waitstaff B-AS
, O
I O
felt O
like O
royalty O
and O
enjoyed O
every O
second O
of O
it O
. O

I O
will O
be O
going O
back O
and O
heartily O
recommend O
it O
! O

Would O
definitely O
visit O
again O
. O

Definitely O
worth O
the O
trip O
to O
Battery O
Park O
City O
! O

Perhaps O
this O
food O
is O
considered O
extreme O
to O
an O
Upper O
East O
Side O
resident O
, O
but O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
us O
who O
' O
ve O
actually O
eaten O
ethnic B-AS
food I-AS
, O
this O
is O
simply O
dull O
. O

The O
place B-AS
was O
real O
empty O
but O
that O
was O
because O
this O
was O
the O
first O
Sunday O
they O
ever O
opened O
. O

This O
little O
place O
definitely O
exceeded O
my O
expectations O
and O
you O
sure O
get O
a O
lot O
of O
food B-AS
for O
your O
money B-AS
. O

Ambience B-AS
is O
delightful O
, O
service B-AS
impeccable O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
excellent O
, O
and O
the O
AC B-AS
worked O
very O
well O
too O
thank O
God O
, O
it O
was O
hot O
! O
. O

Tasty O
but O
expensive O
. O

You O
get O
the O
sense O
that O
the O
people B-AS
there O
care O
about O
their O
restaurant O
and O
about O
your O
experience O
and O
that O
is O
very O
nice O
. O

Both O
are O
delicious O
, O
the O
cooks B-AS
are O
friendly O
and O
are O
willing O
to O
take O
a O
moment O
and O
speak O
to O
you O
and O
shake O
your O
hand O
. O

so O
i O
thought O
why O
not O
change O
it O
up O
a O
bit O
. O

My O
friend O
ordered O
some O
of O
their O
special O
sushi B-AS
rolls I-AS
which O
had O
excellent O
presentation O
and O
tasted O
great O
! O

Although O
be O
warned O
their O
dinner B-AS
menu I-AS
to I-AS
sit I-AS
and O
take B-AS
out I-AS
prices I-AS
are O
different O
. O

The O
staff B-AS
was O
accomodating O
, O
the O
food B-AS
was O
absolutely O
delicious O
and O
the O
place B-AS
is O
lovely O
. O

PS O
Please O
do O
n't O
tell O
anyone O
in O
my O
family O
i O
eat O
there O
. O

my O
picks O
are O
, O
, O
Scallion B-AS
Pancake I-AS
fried O
with O
vegetable B-AS
juice I-AS
, O
very O
special O
and O
tasty O
, O
Guizhou B-AS
Chicken I-AS
, O
Shredded B-AS
Squid I-AS
Family I-AS
Style I-AS
one O
of O
my O
personal O
favorites O
, O
Sichuan B-AS
Spicy I-AS
Soft I-AS
Shell I-AS
Crab I-AS
, O
Shuizhu B-AS
Fish I-AS
this O
one O
is O
for O
hardcore O
Sichuan B-AS
food I-AS
fans O
, O
I O
would O
n't O
recommend O
to O
my O
American O
friends O
as O
it O
's O
very O
spicy O
. O

They O
smell O
like O
they O
stuff O
them O
with O
old O
canned B-AS
vegetables I-AS
like O
the O
spinach B-AS
mushroom I-AS
calzone I-AS
. O

To O
celebrate O
a O
birthday O
, O
three O
of O
us O
went O
to O
Mare O
anticipating O
great O
food B-AS
. O

There O
was O
a O
great O
deal O
for O
6 O
Blue B-AS
Point I-AS
oysters I-AS
and O
a O
beer B-AS
or O
glass B-AS
of I-AS
wine I-AS
for O
$ O
8 O
! O

I O
really O
liked O
the O
noodle B-AS
dishes I-AS
at O
Rice O
Avenue O
compared O
to O
their O
Green B-AS
Curry I-AS
dish I-AS
. O

I O
went O
to O
pams O
with O
my O
girlfriend O
, O
and O
i O
love O
it O
. O

But O
for O
whatever O
reason O
, O
prices B-AS
are O
about O
twice O
as O
high O
. O

I O
am O
relatively O
new O
to O
the O
area O
and O
tried O
Pick O
a O
bgel O
on O
2nd O
and O
was O
disappointed O
with O
the O
service B-AS
and O
I O
thought O
the O
food B-AS
was O
overated O
and O
on O
the O
pricey O
side O
. O

Great O
atmoshere B-AS
and O
worth O
every O
bit O
. O

We O
had O
a O
most O
unpleasant O
experience O
at O
this O
restaurant O
. O

The O
spicy B-AS
tuna I-AS
roll I-AS
was O
unusually O
good O
and O
the O
rock B-AS
shrimp I-AS
tempura I-AS
was O
awesome O
, O
great O
appetizer B-AS
to O
share O
! O

The O
staff B-AS
was O
knowledgeable O
and O
full O
of O
personality O
. O

Great O
staff B-AS
. O

Only O
complaint O
would O
be O
that O
at O
an O
average O
cost B-AS
of O
$ O
12- O
$ O
15 O
per O
meal B-AS
, O
I O
'd O
like O
not O
to O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
finding O
a O
seat B-AS
! O

To O
finish O
off O
such O
a O
delightful O
dinner B-AS
experience O
you O
must O
have O
dessert B-AS
, O
especially O
the O
White B-AS
Chocolate I-AS
Bread I-AS
Pudding I-AS
with I-AS
Gelato I-AS
and I-AS
hot I-AS
chocolate I-AS
. O

The O
banana B-AS
tower I-AS
is O
an O
amazing O
dessert B-AS
as O
well O
. O

I O
went O
there O
with O
my O
friend O
last O
saturday O
. O

Excellent O
atmosphere B-AS
, O
delicious O
dishes B-AS
good O
and O
friendly O
service B-AS
. O

A O
cool O
place B-AS
to O
hang O
with O
your O
friends O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
healthy O
drinks B-AS
and O
desserts B-AS
. O

Great O
vibe B-AS
, O
lots O
of O
people O
. O

I O
like O
Mamoun O
's O
food B-AS
as O
well O
, O
but O
side O
by O
side O
, O
Kati O
Rolls O
just O
produce O
tastier O
food B-AS
hands O
down O
. O

Just O
an O
odd O
group O
. O

The O
service B-AS
is O
a O
bit O
slow O
, O
but O
harkens O
back O
to O
my O
years O
growing O
up O
in O
Napoli O
, O
Italy O
where O
things O
are O
not O
rushed O
and O
when O
you O
sit O
down O
for O
dinner B-AS
the O
table B-AS
is O
yours O
all O
night O
. O

Either O
that O
, O
or O
the O
editor O
's O
idea O
of O
romance O
must O
be O
sharing O
a O
conversation O
with O
the O
next O
table O
, O
while O
trying O
to O
speak O
louder O
than O
the O
traffic O
on O
57th O
. O

I O
love O
this O
place O
! O

it O
is O
not O
consistent O
. O

But O
that O
was O
n't O
the O
icing B-AS
on I-AS
the I-AS
cake I-AS
, O
a O
tiramisu B-AS
that O
resembled O
nothing O
I O
have O
ever O
had O
. O

Great O
food B-AS
and O
the O
prices B-AS
are O
very O
reasonable O
. O

Wine O
list O
is O
not O
huge O
but O
def O
well O
selected O
. O

A O
cool O
bar B-AS
with O
great O
food B-AS
, O
and O
tons O
of O
excellent O
beer B-AS
. O

Be O
sure O
to O
try O
the O
seasonal O
, O
and O
always O
delicious O
, O
specials B-AS
. O

The O
ambience B-AS
is O
authentic O
and O
relaxing O
and O
we O
have O
always O
received O
attentive O
and O
prompt O
service B-AS
. O

Fresh O
, O
authentic O
, O
french B-AS
cuisine I-AS
in O
substantial O
portions B-AS
. O

Drinks B-AS
got O
screwed O
up O
, O
she O
acted O
put O
upon O
. O

The O
one O
vegetarian B-AS
entree I-AS
Abby I-AS
's I-AS
treasure I-AS
was O
actually O
quite O
a O
surprise O
, O
it O
was O
delicious O
and O
had O
wintermelon B-AS
covering O
an O
assortment B-AS
of I-AS
fresh I-AS
mushrooms I-AS
and I-AS
vegetables I-AS
. O

At O
5 O
dumplings B-AS
for O
$ O
1 O
, O
you O
just O
can O
not O
go O
wrong O
. O

But O
the O
pizza B-AS
is O
way O
to O
expensive O
. O

And O
the O
staff B-AS
is O
also O
young O
, O
energeic O
and O
hot O
! O
! O
! O
! O

Even O
better O
, O
they O
know O
how O
to O
cook O
French O
classics O
like O
Steak B-AS
au I-AS
Poivre I-AS
and O
Onglet B-AS
without O
burning O
it O
to O
death O
or O
overcooking O
it O
. O

Service O
was O
decent O
, O
but O
not O
as O
smooth O
as O
I O
would O
expect O
from O
a O
place O
with O
these O
prices B-AS
and O
reputation B-AS
. O

We O
had O
a O
wonderful O
meal B-AS
at O
Naples O
45 O
a O
month O
ago O
on O
a O
visit O
to O
NYC O
. O

Good O
drink B-AS
. O

Great O
food B-AS
spinach I-AS
and I-AS
corn I-AS
dumplings I-AS
and O
massamman B-AS
curry I-AS
, O
very O
friendly O
and O
no O
nonsense O
service B-AS
and O
a O
clean O
and O
funky O
bathroom B-AS
. O

Was O
there O
Friday O
night O
. O

We O
had O
a O
girls O
night O
dinner B-AS
here O
for O
restaurant O
week O
. O

Romantic O
if O
you O
want O
it O
to O
be O
brightly O
lit O
. O

However O
, O
I O
was O
there O
for O
a O
work O
dinner B-AS
not O
long O
ago O
when O
my O
colleague O
from O
London O
noticed O
a O
very O
large O
waterbug O
on O
the O
ceiling B-AS
. O

I O
recommend O
it O
! O

I O
have O
taken O
practically O
every O
guest O
that O
has O
come O
to O
visit O
me O
in O
NY O
and O
hooked O
a O
few O
New O
Yorkers O
onto O
Peep O
as O
well O
. O

enough O
said O
! O

I O
do O
n't O
live O
in O
NY O
but O
my O
best O
friend O
does O
. O

My O
chow B-AS
fun I-AS
and I-AS
chow I-AS
see I-AS
was O
really O
bland O
and O
oily O
. O

Even O
though O
I O
made O
the O
reservation B-AS
at O
3 O
pm O
for O
the O
same O
night O
through O
Dinnerbroker O
, O
we O
were O
seated B-AS
at O
a O
table B-AS
with O
one O
of O
the O
best O
view O
! O

we O
did O
notice O
however O
, O
that O
some O
tables O
had O
what O
looked O
like O
pita B-AS
instead O
of O
naan B-AS
. O

I O
did O
n't O
take O
a O
look O
at O
the O
rest O
menu B-AS
, O
but O
the O
oysters B-AS
were O
fantastic O
. O

After O
the O
review O
I O
treked O
into O
Brooklyn O
. O

The O
grilled B-AS
cheese I-AS
at O
home O
afterwards O
was O
better O
! O
! O
. O

We O
were O
pleasantly O
greeted O
. O

The O
red O
sliding O
doors O
may O
be O
unique O
but O
they O
do O
not O
block O
off O
the O
cold O
air O
from O
the O
outside O
. O

Great O
service B-AS
, O
great O
food B-AS
. O

The O
food O
is O
expensive O
, O
but O
worth O
every O
bite O
. O

sometimes O
i O
get O
bad O
food B-AS
and O
bad O
service B-AS
, O
sometimes O
i O
get O
good B-AS
good I-AS
and O
bad O
service B-AS
. O

When O
we O
were O
finally O
seated O
our O
waitress B-AS
came O
by O
twice-1 O
for O
our O
order O
and O
2-for O
our O
check B-AS
. O

In O
summer O
- O
eat O
outside O
on O
a O
terrace B-AS
another O
great O
feature O
of O
Suan O
! O

! O

It O
's O
the O
perfect O
restaurant O
for O
NY O
life O
style O
, O
it O
got O
cool O
design B-AS
, O
awsome O
drinks B-AS
and O
food B-AS
and O
lot O
's O
of O
good O
looking O
people O
eating O
and O
hanging O
at O
the O
pink O
bar B-AS
. O

Recommendations O
, O
of O
course O
, O
are O
required O
! O

We O
did O
have O
to O
wait O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
for O
approx O
. O

You O
fellas O
above O
says O
its O
the O
best O
Taiwanese O
restaurant O
in O
town O
. O

Yeah O
, O
it O
's O
that O
good O
. O

If O
you O
love O
seafood B-AS
, O
you O
would O
love O
this O
place B-AS
! O

Good O
, O
fast O
service B-AS
. O

Dakshin O
is O
one O
of O
the O
few O
affordable O
and O
tasty O
Indian O
restaurant O
in O
the O
upper O
east O
side O
. O

They O
charge O
different O
prices B-AS
all O
the O
time O
. O

To O
dine O
at O
Thalia O
can O
be O
slightly O
deceiving O
because O
while O
its O
beautiful O
on O
the O
outside O
, O
its O
so O
bland O
on O
the O
inside O
. O

I O
was O
in O
love O
with O
Pongsri O
on O
48th O
, O
but O
compared O
to O
Suan O
it O
is O
slow O
in O
service B-AS
and O
overpriced O
. O

My O
friends O
and O
I O
experienced O
amazing O
cheese B-AS
and O
a O
delicious O
, O
new O
summer O
menu B-AS
at O
Artisanal O
last O
night O
. O

I O
am O
so O
coming O
back O
here O
again O
, O
as O
much O
as O
I O
can O
. O

I O
have O
been O
going O
back O
again O
and O
again O
. O

It O
's O
charmingly O
small O
and O
that O
leads O
to O
an O
atmoshere B-AS
that O
is O
extremely O
cozy O
and O
romantic O
, O
even O
. O

It O
is O
obvious O
that O
no O
one O
in O
the O
restaurant O
has O
any O
idea O
about O
or O
experience O
with O
Japanese B-AS
cuisine I-AS
. O

In O
terms O
of O
the O
food B-AS
itself O
- O
nothing O
special O
, O
we O
limited O
ourselves O
to O
several O
appetizers B-AS
. O

Love O
the O
Jazz B-AS
bands I-AS
on O
Fri O
and O
Sat O
. O

Overall O
, O
excellent O
restaurant O
! O

To O
begin O
, O
we O
were O
told O
there O
was O
a O
30 O
minute O
wait B-AS
and O
started O
to O
leave O
, O
when O
the O
hostess B-AS
offered O
to O
call O
us O
on O
our O
cell O
phone O
when O
the O
table B-AS
was O
ready O
. O

The O
servers B-AS
give O
you O
some O
sample O
slices O
of O
your O
order O
while O
you O
wait O
shortly O
I O
might O
add O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
ok O
. O

When O
asked O
about O
how O
a O
certain O
dish B-AS
was O
prepared O
in O
comparison O
to O
a O
similar O
at O
other O
thai O
restaurants O
, O
he O
replied O
this O
is O
not O
Mcdonald O
's O
, O
every O
place O
makes O
things O
differently O
While O
it O
is O
understandable O
that O
every O
place O
is O
indeed O
different O
, O
there O
was O
not O
a O
need O
to O
be O
uncourteous O
to O
customers O
and O
downright O
rude O
. O

I O
ate O
here O
for O
the O
first O
time O
and O
absolutely O
loved O
it O
! O

Do O
n't O
expect O
to O
sit O
down O
inside O
though O
, O
there O
are O
only O
a O
few O
tables B-AS
and O
they O
are O
always O
full O
. O

The O
staff B-AS
is O
accomodating O
, O
the O
ambiance B-AS
is O
exciting O
and O
yet O
relaxed O
, O
and O
the O
food B-AS
is O
out O
of O
this O
world O
! O

The O
food B-AS
was O
delicious O
I O
had O
a O
halibut B-AS
special I-AS
, O
my O
husband O
had O
steak B-AS
, O
and O
the O
service B-AS
was O
top O
- O
notch O
. O

The O
manager B-AS
claimed O
that O
he O
could O
not O
compensate O
us O
for O
anything O
on O
the O
bill B-AS
which O
just O
shows O
the O
lack O
of O
sophistication O
from O
the O
entire O
group O
. O

This O
is O
by O
far O
my O
favorite O
place O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
. O

But O
too O
far O
east O
! O

Satisfying O
. O

Highly O
Highly O
Highly O
recommended O
! O

it O
's O
the O
only O
place O
you O
can O
get O
yummy O
authentic O
japanese B-AS
comfort I-AS
food I-AS
. O

We O
took O
advanatage O
of O
the O
half B-AS
price I-AS
sushi I-AS
deal I-AS
on O
saturday O
so O
it O
was O
well O
worth O
it O
. O

we O
came O
here O
on O
a O
crowded O
saturday O
night O
and O
were O
seated B-AS
right O
away O
despite O
being O
15 O
minutes O
late O
for O
our O
reservation B-AS
. O

This O
place O
is O
cool O
enough O
to O
be O
in O
the O
East O
Village O
, O
but O
French O
enough O
to O
make O
you O
feel O
like O
you O
could O
be O
in O
a O
bistro O
in O
a O
back O
alley O
in O
Paris O
. O

We O
were O
fast O
to O
order O
the O
appetizer B-AS
platter I-AS
since O
we O
were O
very O
hungry O
. O

The O
staff B-AS
are O
attentive O
, O
and O
have O
smiles O
on O
their O
faces O
. O

This O
is O
the O
BEST O
Shabu O
- O
Shabu O
Restaurant O
in O
the O
Try O
- O
State O
Area O
. O

No O
dress B-AS
codes I-AS
, O
no O
attitudes B-AS
, O
plenty O
of O
comfort O
companionship O
, O
a O
great O
place B-AS
to O
relax O
in O
an O
always O
busy O
Midtown O
. O

Largest O
and O
freshest O
pieces B-AS
of I-AS
sushi I-AS
, O
and O
delicious O
! O

Even O
the O
pasta B-AS
is O
delicious O
here O
a O
rarity O
in O
New O
York O
pizza O
restaurants O
. O

but O
when O
we O
looked O
at O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
there O
were O
n't O
a O
lot O
of O
choices O
, O
most O
of O
them O
were O
dumplings B-AS
in O
the O
appetizer B-AS
section O
. O

Maybe O
I O
say O
so O
because O
it O
looked O
promising O
for O
people O
who O
like O
artery O
- O
clogging O
jewish O
deli O
food O
, O
but O
turns O
out O
to O
be O
poorly O
run O
and O
awful O
. O

After O
my O
3rd O
time O
the O
manager B-AS
remembered O
me O
and O
treated O
me O
like O
an O
usual O
customer O
. O

This O
place O
is O
greatly O
welcome O
in O
the O
desolate O
little O
strip O
between O
the O
Prospect O
Expressway O
and O
Greenwood O
Cemetery O
, O
a O
wasteland O
we O
like O
to O
call O
The O
Sliv O
. O

now O
if O
they O
could O
only O
get O
a O
toaster B-AS
. O

You O
will O
find O
yourself O
returning O
quite O
often O
. O

When O
he O
's O
not O
making O
authentic O
Neapolitan B-AS
pizza I-AS
in O
the O
open O
brick O
oven O
or O
lightly O
frying O
zucchini B-AS
blossoms I-AS
, O
he O
's O
visiting O
the O
regulars O
a O
growing O
legion O
and O
checking O
on O
newcomers O
. O

Wait B-AS
staff I-AS
is O
blantently O
unappreciative O
of O
your O
business O
but O
its O
the O
best O
pie B-AS
on O
the O
UWS O
! O

The O
ingredients B-AS
taste O
fresher O
, O
the O
crust B-AS
is O
thinner O
and O
crispier O
, O
the O
slice B-AS
is O
less O
oily O
, O
and O
it O
's O
never O
burnt O
like O
it O
occasionally O
is O
at O
Joe O
's O
. O

Fish B-AS
is O
so O
very O
fresh O
. O

The O
prices B-AS
were O
CHEAP O
compared O
to O
the O
quality O
of O
service B-AS
and O
food B-AS
. O

Go O
only O
if O
you O
are O
already O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
and O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
bother O
going O
farther O
for O
a O
better O
place O
. O

Top O
spot O
in O
town O
for O
Vietnamese B-AS
classics I-AS
, O
better O
than O
places O
that O
cost O
a O
lot O
more O
. O

less O
wait B-AS
time I-AS
for O
me O
! O

This O
was O
the O
perfect O
quiet O
, O
relaxing O
, O
and O
delicious O
accompaniment O
to O
our O
afternoon O
of O
theater O
. O

The O
decor B-AS
is O
really O
blah O
, O
and O
not O
at O
all O
hip O
or O
happening O
. O

Having O
discovered O
Ping O
's O
on O
the O
internet O
, O
we O
entered O
with O
qualms O
but O
were O
instantly O
put O
to O
ease O
by O
the O
fish B-AS
tanks I-AS
that O
greet O
you O
as O
u O
walk O
in O
. O

You O
can O
not O
go O
wrong O
at O
the O
Red O
Eye O
Grill O
. O

It O
appears O
to O
be O
the O
owner B-AS
's O
first O
venture O
and O
it O
shows O
. O

I O
come O
from O
a O
family O
of O
pizzeria O
owners O
, O
and O
I O
' O
m O
almost O
ashamed O
to O
say O
that O
the O
pizza B-AS
in O
Fornino O
's O
blows O
my O
families O
receipies O
away O
. O

I O
go O
twice O
a O
month O
! O

We O
ordered O
some O
beef B-AS
and O
noodle B-AS
soup I-AS
dishes I-AS
from O
the O
Thai O
section O
of O
the O
menu B-AS
but O
nothing O
we O
got O
was O
Thai O
. O

They O
have O
a O
huge O
selection O
of O
different O
cream B-AS
cheeses I-AS
and O
all O
of O
their O
salads B-AS
are O
great O
. O

The O
lobster B-AS
sandwich I-AS
is O
good O
and O
the O
spaghetti B-AS
with I-AS
Scallops I-AS
and I-AS
Shrimp I-AS
is O
great O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
authentic O
. O

The O
dim B-AS
sum I-AS
is O
delectable O
while O
the O
prices B-AS
are O
quite O
easy O
on O
the O
wallet O
. O

I O
only O
tried O
a O
simple O
dish B-AS
of O
spinach B-AS
ravioli I-AS
in I-AS
a I-AS
light I-AS
oil I-AS
and I-AS
garlic I-AS
sauce I-AS
, O
but O
it O
actually O
faired O
better O
than O
most O
NYC O
Italian O
joints O
I O
' O
ve O
tried O
similar O
dish B-AS
at O
. O

The O
worst O
excuse O
for O
Japanese B-AS
food I-AS
I O
' O
ve O
ever O
encountered O
. O

A O
million O
better O
places O
to O
go O
in O
the O
city O
. O

If O
celebrities O
make O
you O
sweat O
, O
then O
your O
in O
for O
a O
ride O
, O
but O
if O
your O
like O
most O
around O
these O
parts O
then O
you O
'll O
just O
yawn O
and O
wonder O
what O
s O
with O
all O
the O
hype O
. O

Okay O
- O
i O
do O
n't O
mind O
the O
oily O
part O
cause O
most O
are O
cooked O
that O
way O
but O
it O
was O
way O
too O
bland O
. O

I O
ordered O
a O
Chicken B-AS
Teriyaki I-AS
dish I-AS
and O
found O
that O
the O
chicken B-AS
was O
extremely O
dry O
. O

I O
love O
it O
. O

If O
you O
want O
something O
really O
different O
than O
try O
Jekyll O
and O
Hyde O
. O

We O
had O
reservations B-AS
at O
9 O
pm O
, O
but O
was O
not O
seated O
until O
10 O
, O
15pm O
. O

We O
had O
Pam B-AS
's I-AS
special I-AS
fried I-AS
fish I-AS
and O
it O
was O
amazing O
. O

Its O
located O
in O
greenewich O
village O
. O

There O
is O
no O
excuse O
for O
such O
lousy O
service B-AS
! O

Three O
strikes O
and O
this O
restaurant O
is O
out O
. O

We O
bring O
in O
a O
party O
of O
ten O
or O
so O
every O
week O
. O

My O
boyfriend O
had O
the O
New B-AS
England I-AS
Chowder I-AS
it O
was O
good O
but O
I O
think O
the O
award O
should O
go O
to O
the O
Lobster B-AS
Bisque I-AS
. O

So O
, O
a O
little O
inconsistency O
there O
but O
either O
way O
, O
both O
pizzas B-AS
were O
really O
good O
. O

Overall O
the O
restaurant O
is O
more O
expensive O
than O
our O
other O
sushi B-AS
favorites O
, O
but O
everything O
was O
delicious O
. O

We O
would O
return O
to O
this O
place O
again O
! O

Not O
enough O
wines B-AS
by I-AS
the I-AS
glass I-AS
either O
. O

I O
had O
the O
duck B-AS
breast I-AS
special I-AS
on O
my O
last O
visit O
and O
it O
was O
incredible O
. O

I O
must O
say O
it O
's O
a O
little O
pricey O
for O
the O
food B-AS
because O
it O
was O
not O
as O
spectacular O
as O
the O
view O
. O

These O
innovators O
of O
french B-AS
indian I-AS
fusion I-AS
do O
a O
great O
job O
of O
making O
dishes B-AS
as O
interesting O
as O
possible O
while O
still O
being O
accessible O
. O

Just O
do O
n't O
take O
the O
seat B-AS
between O
the O
bar B-AS
and O
the O
back O
half O
of O
the O
restaurant O
, O
i O
saw O
a O
woman O
get O
nudged O
40times O
sitting O
there O
. O

No O
gimmicks O
here O
- O
the O
food B-AS
speaks O
for O
itself O
in O
its O
freshness O
and O
preparation O
. O

We O
were O
worried O
we O
would O
have O
trouble O
getting O
in O
, O
but O
somehow O
managed O
to O
have O
a O
short O
wait B-AS
. O

My O
wife O
had O
the O
fried B-AS
shrimp I-AS
which O
are O
huge O
and O
loved O
it O
. O

Everything O
I O
had O
was O
good O
, O
and O
I O
' O
m O
a O
eater O
. O

One O
should O
not O
go O
to O
Lucky O
Strike O
for O
the O
food B-AS
. O

The O
service B-AS
is O
awful O
-- O
the O
last O
time O
I O
was O
there O
and O
I O
do O
mean O
the O
last O
time O
we O
were O
told O
that O
they O
needed O
our O
table B-AS
so O
we O
would O
have O
to O
leave O
. O

We O
could O
only O
get O
through O
an O
appetizer B-AS
and O
cheese B-AS
fondue I-AS
. O

To O
me O
it O
exemplifies O
Soho O
, O
cute O
, O
artsy O
, O
interesting O
. O

Try O
everything O
for O
that O
matter O
, O
it O
is O
all O
good O
. O

Both O
times O
we O
waited O
well O
over O
a O
half O
hour O
for O
a O
table B-AS
even O
though O
we O
had O
reservations B-AS
. O

happy O
to O
be O
a O
regular O
at O
this O
place O
and O
would O
warmly O
recommend O
it O
to O
anyone O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
been O
eating O
at O
Taj O
Mahal O
for O
over O
twenty O
years O
and O
have O
found O
them O
to O
be O
the O
most O
excellent O
of O
the O
Indian O
eateries O
on O
this O
block O
of O
Indian O
restaurants O
. O

night O
without O
a O
reservation B-AS
, O
we O
had O
to O
wait B-AS
at O
the O
bar B-AS
for O
a O
little O
while O
, O
but O
the O
manager B-AS
was O
so O
nice O
and O
made O
our O
wait B-AS
a O
great O
experience O
. O

Try O
the O
green B-AS
curry I-AS
! O
! O
! O

We O
had O
the O
scallops B-AS
as O
an O
appetizer B-AS
and O
they O
were O
delicious O
and O
the O
sauce B-AS
was O
wonderful O
. O

We O
were O
also O
seated O
promptly O
at O
the O
time O
of O
our O
reservation B-AS
and O
the O
service B-AS
was O
very O
quick O
and O
professional O
. O

You O
rarely O
have O
to O
wait O
for O
a O
seat B-AS
and O
the O
currys B-AS
( I-AS
masaman I-AS
, I-AS
green I-AS
, I-AS
red I-AS
) I-AS
are O
full O
of O
flavor B-AS
and O
come O
super O
spicy O
if O
you O
ask O
for O
it O
. O

The O
food B-AS
there O
are O
sastifying O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
to O
anyone O
to O
give O
this O
place O
a O
try O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
visiting O
this O
restaurant O
and O
having O
dinner B-AS
and O
drinks B-AS
! O

The O
bar B-AS
is O
very O
well O
stocked O
with O
interesting O
beers B-AS
and O
well O
priced B-AS
wines I-AS
. O

I O
agree O
. O

Last O
memorial O
day O
, O
I O
tried O
to O
make O
reservations B-AS
but O
was O
told O
they O
were O
closed O
that O
weekend O
interesting O
, O
but O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
good O
. O

Great O
wine B-AS
selection I-AS
, O
Gigondas B-AS
is O
worth O
the O
price B-AS
, O
and O
the O
house B-AS
champagne I-AS
is O
a O
great O
value O
. O

at O
night O
, O
but O
it O
's O
hard O
to O
hear O
your O
own O
conversation O
with O
everyone O
else O
competing O
for O
that O
same O
luxury O
, O
the O
music B-AS
playing O
in O
the O
background O
is O
also O
voluminous O
. O

It O
just O
was O
n't O
Thai O
. O

I O
have O
enjoyed O
everything O
I O
have O
ever O
gotten O
and O
the O
fish B-AS
is O
so O
fresh O
and O
always O
prepared O
in O
a O
great O
way O
. O

I O
particularly O
love O
their O
yellowfun B-AS
tuna I-AS
and O
their O
mussel B-AS
selection I-AS
. O

I O
love O
to O
visit O
Murrays O
for O
my O
bagel B-AS
fix O
. O

We O
made O
early O
dinner B-AS
reservations I-AS
and O
were O
thoroughly O
impressed O
, O
reminds O
me O
of O
my O
grandfather O
, O
its O
old O
school O
Italian O
scenery B-AS
with O
lots O
of O
fun O
stuff O
to O
admire O
. O

Recommended O
. O

The O
place B-AS
was O
nice O
and O
calm O
. O

Cheese B-AS
plate I-AS
is O
a O
varied O
delight O
and O
great O
bargain O
at O
$ O
10 O
. O

I O
could O
have O
drank O
4 O
glasses B-AS
of I-AS
water I-AS
and O
still O
been O
parched O
, O
so O
watch O
out O
. O

When O
we O
sat O
, O
we O
got O
great O
and O
fast O
service B-AS
. O

Most O
of O
the O
servers B-AS
are O
very O
attentive O
, O
friendly O
and O
quite O
attractive O
. O

I O
think O
locals O
rate O
this O
place O
so O
high O
. O

Service B-AS
is O
average O
. O

But O
they O
' O
ve O
done O
a O
really O
nice O
job O
of O
offering O
all O
the O
typical O
pizzeria O
faves O
plus O
some O
terrific O
specials B-AS
like O
the O
Godmother B-AS
pizza I-AS
( I-AS
a I-AS
sort I-AS
of I-AS
traditional I-AS
flat I-AS
pizza I-AS
with I-AS
an I-AS
olive I-AS
oil I-AS
- I-AS
brushed I-AS
crust I-AS
and I-AS
less I-AS
tomato I-AS
sauce I-AS
than I-AS
usual I-AS
) I-AS
. O

Go O
girls O
! O
! O
! O

They O
forgot O
a O
sandwich B-AS
, O
did O
n't O
include O
plastic B-AS
forks I-AS
, O
and O
did O
n't O
include O
pita B-AS
with O
the O
hummus B-AS
platter I-AS
. O

The O
steak B-AS
is O
good O
, O
the O
fish B-AS
is O
good O
and O
the O
sushi B-AS
was O
surprisingly O
great O
. O

For O
asian O
fusion O
, O
there O
are O
many O
places O
further O
downtown O
. O

Old O
school O
meets O
New O
world O
. O

I O
am O
reluctant O
to O
write O
because O
I O
would O
not O
want O
my O
jem O
of O
a O
pizza B-AS
place O
to O
become O
overcrowded O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
poor O
, O
restaurant O
poorly O
lit O
, O
staff B-AS
not O
very O
attentive O
and O
I O
would O
have O
rather O
eaten O
at O
a O
Mcdonald O
's O
than O
this O
joint O
. O

This O
is O
probably O
one O
of O
my O
new O
favorite O
places O
. O

For O
being O
number O
1 O
, O
this O
place O
has O
alot O
of O
work O
to O
do O
in O
order O
to O
truly O
earn O
its O
so O
called O
reputation O
. O

For O
myself O
and O
family O
we O
would O
only O
go O
here O
to O
celebrate O
an O
occassion O
, O
I O
do O
prefer O
smaller O
, O
quiter O
restaurants O
. O

The O
one O
on O
the O
east O
side O
is O
much O
better O
than O
the O
one O
on O
the O
west O
side O
. O

They O
all O
know O
you O
. O

My O
GF O
and O
I O
still O
choose O
to O
eat O
there O
a O
lot O
because O
of O
diverse O
cocktails B-AS
, O
the O
chill O
decor B-AS
, O
and O
the O
decent O
sushi B-AS
. O

We O
ended O
the O
dinner B-AS
with O
a O
surprisingly O
light O
and O
flaky O
apple B-AS
tarte I-AS
tatin I-AS
. O

The O
buffet B-AS
had O
a O
nice O
selection B-AS
. O

Waitstaff B-AS
are O
very O
friendly O
. O

This O
restaurant O
is O
such O
a O
great O
place O
. O

Once O
you O
step O
into O
Cosette O
, O
you O
're O
miraculously O
in O
a O
small O
, O
off O
- O
the O
- O
beaten O
path O
Parisian O
bistro O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
been O
several O
times O
and O
am O
totally O
smitten O
. O

Terrible O
experience O
. O

I O
love O
the O
place O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
slow O
had O
to O
wait O
to O
order O
and O
get O
food B-AS
although O
not O
crowded O
. O

Will O
have O
to O
return O
to O
try O
the O
chocolate B-AS
! O

It O
's O
only O
$ O
195 O
for O
a O
regular O
slice O
and O
$ O
400 O
for O
a O
slice O
with O
a O
mushroom O
, O
not O
mushrooms O
. O

There O
is O
a O
real O
gallery O
of O
stars O
that O
have O
visited O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
below O
average O
, O
the O
service B-AS
was O
pathetic O
, O
there O
was O
no O
ambience B-AS
at O
all O
. O

I O
REALLY O
ENJOYED O
THE O
SHOWS B-AS
PUT O
ON O
BY O
THE O
ACTORS B-AS
. O

Our O
first O
time O
in O
New O
York O
and O
we O
had O
to O
try O
a O
New B-AS
York I-AS
Bagel I-AS
. O

service B-AS
was O
efficient O
courteous O
. O

this O
one O
is O
definintely O
my O
least O
favorite O
. O

I O
have O
been O
urged O
by O
friends O
for O
months O
to O
check O
out O
the O
mermaid O
inn O
. O

The O
miso B-AS
soup I-AS
lacked O
flavor B-AS
and O
the O
fish B-AS
was O
unfortunately O
not O
as O
well O
prepared O
as O
in O
the O
past O
. O

Everytime O
my O
husband O
and O
I O
go O
there O
, O
we O
are O
never O
disappointed O
. O

They O
are O
the O
best O
bagels B-AS
I O
' O
ve O
had O
. O

We O
were O
not O
disappointed O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
read O
some O
of O
the O
previews O
reviews O
, O
people O
are O
either O
not O
New O
Yorkers O
or O
have O
more O
appreciation O
for O
ambience B-AS
then O
food B-AS
. O

Toons O
has O
recently O
been O
redone O
, O
so O
it O
's O
now O
a O
very O
attractive O
space B-AS
. O

$ O
160 O
for O
2 O
filets B-AS
, O
2 O
sides B-AS
, O
an O
appetizer B-AS
and O
drinks B-AS
. O

While O
the O
prices B-AS
are O
nothing O
special O
, O
the O
portions B-AS
are O
huge O
. O

Its O
a O
nice O
quiet O
location B-AS
to O
go O
eat O
a O
good O
meal B-AS
, O
relax O
, O
be O
able O
to O
talk O
and O
have O
a O
very O
good O
time O
. O

We O
arrived O
for O
dinner B-AS
expecting O
to O
be O
impressed O
by O
a O
place O
that O
has O
an O
impressive O
past O
, O
but O
, O
that O
's O
just O
it O
- O
the O
PAST O
! O

However O
, O
I O
think O
this O
place O
is O
a O
good O
hang O
out O
spot B-AS
. O

The O
menu B-AS
is O
Prix B-AS
Fixe I-AS
, O
so O
be O
prepared O
to O
spend O
at O
least O
$ O
60 O
per O
person O
, O
but O
it O
is O
Well O
worth O
itsuperb O
food B-AS
. O

Rao O
is O
a O
good O
restaurant O
, O
but O
it O
's O
nothing O
special O
. O

The O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
is O
extensive O
and O
impressive O
. O

We O
had O
the O
most O
wonderful O
waitress B-AS
. O

While O
the O
staff B-AS
at O
this O
little O
bistro O
is O
very O
friendly O
, O
I O
have O
never O
experienced O
more O
incompetency O
. O

The O
quail B-AS
was O
fantastic O
and O
unique O
and O
the O
pastas B-AS
were O
full O
of O
flavor B-AS
. O

When O
we O
left O
at O
8 O
, O
00 O
PM O
, O
it O
was O
packed O
and O
noisy O
. O

Okay O
, O
so O
I O
never O
write O
but O
there O
does O
n't O
seem O
to O
fair O
balance O
of O
positive O
to O
negative O
reviews O
concerning O
Green O
Bo O
and O
it O
's O
time O
to O
speak O
up O
, O
I O
live O
in O
Chinatown O
. O

The O
zucchini B-AS
and O
mashed B-AS
potatoes I-AS
are O
a O
blend O
of O
garlic B-AS
and O
butter B-AS
which O
simply O
melts O
in O
your O
mouth O
. O

The O
staff B-AS
is O
courteous O
and O
friendly O
. O

Never O
fails O
to O
please O
. O

Decor B-AS
is O
nice O
though O
service B-AS
can O
be O
spotty O
. O

Aside O
from O
the O
rushed O
service B-AS
, O
we O
were O
very O
impressed O
with O
the O
food B-AS
and O
the O
drinks B-AS
. O

Will O
absolutely O
visit O
again O
. O

Make O
sure O
you O
have O
the O
Spicy B-AS
Scallop I-AS
roll I-AS
. O

I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
this O
place O
to O
anyone O
who O
is O
looking O
for O
a O
fine O
Indian B-AS
dining I-AS
experience I-AS
that O
is O
definitely O
a O
value O
for O
your O
dollar O
. O

And O
even O
with O
it O
's O
Pub O
atmosphere O
they O
were O
great O
to O
my O
kids O
too O
! O

This O
big O
draw O
is O
the O
all O
you O
can O
sushi B-AS
here O
for O
$ O
1995 O
! O
. O

I O
consider O
the O
best O
Grand O
Sichuan O
restaurant O
in O
NYC O
. O

we O
spent O
50 O
$ O
$ O
definetly O
will O
come O
back O
with O
my O
friends O
! O
! O
! O

Went O
to O
Village O
last O
night O
for O
my O
birthday O
. O

Some O
of O
the O
workers B-AS
ignore O
me O
and O
talk O
to O
the O
female O
customers O
, O
other O
times O
, O
they O
' O
ve O
skipped O
my O
order B-AS
. O

The O
specials B-AS
are O
usually O
quite O
good O
too O
. O

They O
' O
ve O
the O
best O
desserts B-AS
and O
mixed B-AS
drinks I-AS
as O
well O
as O
snack B-AS
foods I-AS
. O

Try O
the O
chocolate B-AS
mud I-AS
cake I-AS
( I-AS
warmed I-AS
) I-AS
with O
2 O
scoops O
of O
dulce B-AS
de I-AS
leche I-AS
gelato I-AS
. O

That O
's O
good O
and O
bad O
. O

Really O
cool O
stauff B-AS
inside O
. O

While O
the O
new O
restaurant O
still O
features O
much O
of O
the O
same O
classical B-AS
furniture I-AS
that O
made O
Tiffin O
so O
attractive O
, O
the O
menu B-AS
has O
been O
overhauled O
. O

The O
best O
burger B-AS
I O
have O
had O
in O
the O
Village O
. O

We O
visited O
Orsay O
during O
NY O
Restaurant O
Week O
and O
tried O
their O
$ O
35 O
menu B-AS
. O

I O
would O
have O
gotten O
some O
cole B-AS
slaw I-AS
and O
a O
knish B-AS
if O
my O
stomach O
had O
more O
space O
. O

came O
here O
for O
restaurant O
week O
, O
did O
n't O
save O
much O
, O
but O
it O
was O
still O
great O
. O

Would O
NEVER O
go O
back O
there O
. O

Three O
of O
us O
arrived O
for O
dinner B-AS
about O
5 O
, O
30 O
on O
a O
week O
night O
without O
reservations B-AS
. O

The O
blond B-AS
wood I-AS
decor I-AS
is O
very O
soothing O
, O
the O
premium O
sake B-AS
is O
excellent O
and O
the O
service B-AS
is O
great O
. O

There O
is O
usually O
a O
wait O
but O
it O
is O
well O
worth O
it O
. O

Be O
careful O
, O
when O
they O
say O
spicy O
, O
they O
mean O
it O
! O

Your O
money B-AS
could O
easily O
be O
better O
spent O
elsewhere O
Anywhere O
. O

Only O
drawback O
, O
they O
wo O
n't O
toast O
your O
bagel B-AS
, O
and O
they O
do O
n't O
make O
eggs B-AS
for O
the O
bagel B-AS
. O

As O
always O
we O
had O
a O
great O
glass B-AS
of I-AS
wine I-AS
while O
we O
waited O
. O

Bring O
your O
appetites O
. O

The O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
is O
pleasant O
, O
fun O
, O
and O
for O
the O
most O
part O
gorgeous O
in O
the O
wonderful O
aesthetic O
beautification O
way O
, O
not O
in O
that O
she's O
- O
way O
- O
cuter O
- O
than O
- O
me O
- O
that O
- O
b O
@ O
# O
$ O
* O
way O
. O

Of O
course O
this O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
lacking O
, O
but O
what O
do O
you O
expect O
from O
a O
24 O
hour O
bagel B-AS
place O
anyways O
? O

Service B-AS
was O
very O
good O
and O
warm O
. O

For O
dinner B-AS
I O
had O
the O
chicken B-AS
tikka I-AS
- I-AS
masala I-AS
and O
some O
garlic B-AS
naan I-AS
. O

Cornelia O
Street O
looks O
like O
a O
Broadway O
set O
for O
West O
Side O
Story O
and O
the O
inside O
of O
Po O
is O
so O
cool O
quaint O
you O
really O
ca O
n't O
top O
the O
setting B-AS
for O
a O
romantic O
dinner B-AS
in O
NYC O
. O

Like O
others O
have O
said O
, O
do O
n't O
expect O
the O
restaurant O
to O
make O
a O
nite O
out O
romantic O
for O
you O
and O
yes O
, O
a O
busy O
restaurant O
may O
require O
you O
to O
wait O
. O

Seriously O
, O
this O
place O
kicks O
ass O
. O

Food B-AS
was O
good O
and O
the O
view B-AS
of O
the O
new O
york O
city O
skiline O
was O
terrific O
even O
on O
a O
foggy O
rainy O
day O
like O
that O
of O
when O
I O
went O
. O

Also O
, O
because O
it O
is O
so O
thin O
, O
it O
gets O
cold O
very O
quickly O
and O
its O
not O
that O
filling O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
nothing O
like O
its O
menu B-AS
description I-AS
. O

Try O
the O
Pad B-AS
Se I-AS
- I-AS
Ew I-AS
or O
Chicken B-AS
with I-AS
Cashew I-AS
Nuts I-AS
for O
a O
memorable O
and O
repeatable O
experience O
. O

It O
's O
just O
OK O
pizza B-AS
. O

I O
loved O
it O
and O
would O
HIGHLY O
RECOMMEND O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
been O
here O
twice O
now O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
decent O
at O
best O
, O
and O
the O
ambience O
, O
well O
, O
it O
's O
a O
matter O
of O
opinion O
, O
some O
may O
consider O
it O
to O
be O
a O
sweet O
thing O
, O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
just O
annoying O
. O

THE O
BEST O
PLACE O
TO O
BRING O
KIDS O
OR O
ANY O
FRIENDS O
WHO O
WANT O
TO O
DO O
SOMETHING O
DIFFERENT O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
a O
bit O
slow O
, O
but O
they O
were O
very O
friendly O
. O

However O
, O
I O
do O
not O
understand O
the O
extraordinary O
hype O
about O
this O
restaurant O
. O

It O
's O
a O
small O
cute O
restaurant O
. O

I O
will O
be O
returning O
. O

Leon O
is O
an O
East O
Village O
gem O
, O
casual O
but O
hip O
, O
with O
well O
prepared O
basic O
French B-AS
bistro I-AS
fare I-AS
, O
good O
specials B-AS
, O
a O
warm O
and O
lively O
atmosphere B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
above O
average O
for O
midtown O
and O
sligtly O
better O
than O
some O
of O
the O
other O
Heartland O
Breweries O
in O
the O
city O
. O

Thius O
is O
a O
must O
for O
anyone O
who O
loves O
Shabu B-AS
- I-AS
Shabu I-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
absolutely O
horrible O
! O

Food O
does O
n't O
appear O
to O
be O
cooked O
on O
premisis O
but O
there O
's O
a O
high O
turnover O
so O
its O
pretty O
fresh O
. O

Restaurant O
was O
dirty O
and O
unkempt O
. O

Nice O
place O
though O
. O

Warning O
, O
You O
may O
find O
it O
difficult O
to O
dine O
at O
other O
Japanese O
restaurants O
after O
a O
visit O
to O
Mizu O
! O

Similar O
to O
other O
Indian O
restaurants O
, O
they O
use O
the O
dinner B-AS
special I-AS
to O
attract O
customers O
at O
the O
door O
. O

It O
is O
a O
small O
restuarant O
so O
go O
early O
and O
it O
will O
be O
nice O
and O
quiet O
go O
late O
and O
it O
will O
be O
packed O
! O

The O
people O
with O
carts O
of O
food B-AS
do O
n't O
understand O
you O
because O
they O
do O
n't O
speak O
English O
, O
their O
job O
is O
to O
give O
you O
the O
delicious O
food B-AS
you O
point O
at O
. O

The O
crackling B-AS
calamari I-AS
salad I-AS
, O
which O
is O
usually O
a O
cheap O
disaster O
at O
many O
restaurants O
, O
is O
crispy O
and O
lightly O
dressed O
. O

Not O
the O
greatest O
sushi B-AS
place I-AS
, O
but O
excellent O
for O
a O
$ O
1995 O
all O
you O
can O
eat O
. O

Shockingly O
easy O
to O
throw O
a O
group B-AS
dinner I-AS
here O
, O
simple O
contract O
, O
deposit O
only O
to O
hold O
the O
date O
the O
entire O
2nd O
fl O
mezz O
for O
our O
grp O
of O
20 O
. O

The O
Thai B-AS
ice I-AS
tea I-AS
was O
amazingly O
smooth O
and O
yummy O
! O

We O
' O
ve O
never O
had O
any O
problems O
with O
the O
staff B-AS
but O
maybe O
we O
' O
ve O
been O
lucky O
? O

Drinks B-AS
way O
over O
priced B-AS
. O

The O
main O
downside O
to O
the O
place O
is O
the O
nazi O
- O
like O
guy B-AS
running O
it O
who O
constantly O
complains O
about O
the O
noise B-AS
level I-AS
. O

What O
I O
did O
n't O
like O
was O
how O
the O
food B-AS
came O
right O
after O
it O
was O
ordered O
. O

But O
WARNING O
, O
to O
all O
those O
that O
use O
this O
site O
be O
weary O
, O
be O
very O
weary O
of O
recommendations O
. O

Moderate O
prices B-AS
. O

We O
had O
a O
great O
time O
at O
the O
Jekyll O
and O
hyde O
Pub O
last O
night O
. O

Try O
it O
side O
by O
side O
and O
there O
's O
no O
comparison O
. O

I O
think O
I O
' O
ve O
had O
some O
the O
best O
meals B-AS
of O
my O
life O
at O
minnow O
. O

My O
biggest O
complaint O
was O
the O
un O
- O
tasty O
food O
although O
presented O
well O
. O

This O
tiny O
restaurant O
is O
as O
cozy O
as O
it O
gets O
, O
with O
that O
certain O
Parisian O
flair O
. O

So O
sorry O
I O
ca O
n't O
rate O
this O
better O
. O

Most O
importantly O
, O
food B-AS
is O
excellent O
. O

Buon O
appetito O
! O

Great O
roofdeck B-AS
, O
nice O
group O
of O
30 O
somethings O
, O
but O
no O
music B-AS
, O
kind O
of O
quiet O
. O

If O
we O
were O
to O
move O
from O
the O
upper O
east O
side O
, O
we O
would O
genuinely O
miss O
this O
restaurant O
. O

The O
best O
part O
of O
the O
experience O
was O
knowing O
that O
the O
manager B-AS
a O
bubbly O
, O
friendly O
young O
woman O
with O
a O
great O
smile O
truly O
cared O
about O
how O
we O
were O
doing O
. O

Ok O
, O
for O
all O
of O
us O
growing O
up O
in O
the O
Village O
of O
NYC O
, O
we O
have O
spoiled O
by O
a O
plethora O
of O
restaurants O
, O
most O
of O
which O
stay O
open O
very O
late O
. O

However O
, O
service B-AS
was O
as O
plain O
as O
sesame B-AS
crusted I-AS
Salmon I-AS
I O
had O
. O

I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
it O
. O

It O
's O
great O
to O
go O
for O
a O
quick O
lunch B-AS
either O
alone O
or O
with O
a O
friend O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
mediocre O
at O
best O
but O
it O
was O
the O
horrible O
service B-AS
that O
made O
me O
vow O
never O
to O
go O
back O
. O

LLOOVVE O
THIS O
PLACE O
. O

So O
some O
of O
the O
reviews O
here O
are O
accurate O
about O
the O
crowd B-AS
and O
noise B-AS
. O

You O
get O
what O
you O
pay O
for O
and O
with O
that O
logic O
in O
mind O
, O
Spice O
is O
a O
great O
place O
to O
grab O
some O
cheap O
eats B-AS
and O
drinks B-AS
in O
a O
beautiful O
setting B-AS
. O

Finally O
, O
after O
all O
the O
raving O
I O
went O
to O
check O
it O
out O
with O
one O
of O
my O
enthusiastic O
friends O
this O
last O
Saturday O
night O
and O
let O
me O
tell O
you O
its O
all O
its O
cracked O
up O
to O
be O
. O

Place O
should O
also O
have O
a O
1,2,3 O
chili O
rating O
to O
be O
more O
authentic O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
terrible O
, O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
everything O
and O
ask O
several O
of O
different O
people O
for O
the O
same O
thing O
before O
we O
were O
allowed O
to O
be O
served B-AS
. O

Went O
last O
Thursday O
. O

I O
love O
this O
place O
more O
and O
more O
everytime O
i O
go O
. O

I O
go O
and O
eat O
out O
at O
many O
different O
restaurants O
and O
this O
is O
one O
place O
you O
have O
go O
and O
try O
. O

Other O
than O
being O
a O
little O
crowded O
and O
a O
bit O
overpriced O
, O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
filled O
with O
energy O
and O
the O
beautiful O
people B-AS
of O
course O
and O
the O
food B-AS
was O
surprising O
good O
! O

We O
only O
ordered O
desserts B-AS
and O
drinks B-AS
, O
but O
no O
refills O
were O
offered O
. O

Saul O
is O
the O
best O
restaurant O
on O
Smith O
Street O
and O
in O
Brooklyn O
. O

Waiters O
are O
slow O
but O
sweet O
. O

I O
have O
been O
here O
a O
few O
times O
for O
dinner B-AS
, O
once O
for O
brunch B-AS
and O
twice O
for O
lunch B-AS
. O

We O
went O
to O
Ino O
for O
Valentines O
. O

the O
real O
kicker O
of O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
however O
, O
is O
the O
beef B-AS
cubes I-AS
or O
the O
chicken B-AS
with I-AS
chili I-AS
and I-AS
lemon I-AS
grass I-AS
. O

It O
was O
good O
, O
but O
was O
not O
what O
I O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
. O

The O
music B-AS
is O
the O
best O
among O
all O
the O
Indian O
restaurants O
I O
have O
visited O
. O

The O
bread B-AS
and O
lamb B-AS
chops I-AS
I O
had O
before O
the O
meal B-AS
were O
quite O
good O
, O
however O
. O

He O
always O
says O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
customers O
. O

Rao O
's O
has O
the O
best O
service B-AS
and O
atmosphere B-AS
in O
NYC O
. O

instead O
ordered O
an O
ice O
cold O
beer B-AS
which O
to O
me O
works O
with O
indian O
. O

Good O
for O
dates O
or O
with O
friends O
. O

They O
never O
brought O
us O
complimentary O
noodles B-AS
, O
ignored O
repeated O
requests O
for O
sugar B-AS
, O
and O
threw O
our O
dishes B-AS
on O
the O
table O
. O

one O
of O
the O
best O
Chicken B-AS
Tikka I-AS
Masala I-AS
. O

Excellent O
dumplings B-AS
served O
amid O
clean O
, O
chic O
decor B-AS
. O

The O
kitchen B-AS
however O
, O
is O
almost O
always O
slow O
. O

The O
corned B-AS
beef I-AS
and O
pastrami B-AS
are O
excellent O
, O
much O
less O
fatty O
than O
those O
big O
tourist O
places O
around O
Times O
Square O
. O

Cute O
place B-AS
, O
nice O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
but O
would O
never O
go O
there O
again O
. O

We O
had O
a O
good O
time O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
hostess B-AS
called O
me O
today O
to O
thank O
us O
for O
coming O
and O
mentioned O
how O
she O
hoped O
that O
my O
girlfriend O
enjoyed O
her O
birthday O
, O
unexpected O
, O
but O
a O
truly O
above O
and O
beyond O
thing O
to O
do O
. O

people B-AS
are O
rude O
bit O
again O
it O
's O
new O
york O
! O

We O
all O
felt O
it O
was O
worth O
it O
. O

The O
plain B-AS
slice I-AS
is O
great O
and O
if O
you O
get O
toppings B-AS
, O
the O
whole O
slice O
is O
topped O
with O
them O
, O
not O
sparsely O
sprinkled O
on O
like O
some O
places O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
also O
horrible O
and O
the O
ambience B-AS
is O
not O
that O
great O
. O

Service B-AS
is O
great O
, O
takeout B-AS
is O
good O
too O
. O

Based O
on O
the O
reviews O
on O
here O
, O
it O
appears O
that O
the O
restaurant O
is O
overwhelmed O
after O
the O
7 O
PM O
. O

The O
pizza B-AS
is O
overpriced O
and O
soggy O
. O

Everything O
is O
excellent O
, O
the O
menu B-AS
is O
quite O
extensive O
, O
and O
you O
eat O
with O
a O
view B-AS
on O
both O
sides O
of O
the O
city O
. O

You O
'll O
pay O
at O
least O
double O
at O
any O
other O
Italian O
restaurant O
in O
the O
city O
, O
and O
most O
still O
do O
n't O
compare O
. O

For O
the O
quality B-AS
of I-AS
food I-AS
, O
a O
little O
too O
expensive O
. O

Came O
looking O
for O
this O
place O
because O
I O
heard O
good O
things O
. O

I O
live O
on O
the O
street O
this O
place O
is O
on O
. O

Horrible O
. O

Here O
's O
to O
the O
fake O
fish B-AS
tanks I-AS
too O
. O

Its O
worth O
the O
wait O
though O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
never O
had O
bad O
service B-AS
and O
the O
fish B-AS
is O
fresh O
and O
delicious O
. O

The O
first O
time O
I O
went O
, O
and O
was O
completely O
taken O
by O
the O
live B-AS
jazz I-AS
band I-AS
and O
atmosphere B-AS
, O
I O
ordered O
the O
Lobster B-AS
Cobb I-AS
Salad I-AS
. O

we O
decided O
to O
eat O
in O
tea B-AS
room I-AS
which O
was O
small O
and O
cute O
. O

What O
an O
amazing O
meal B-AS
and O
experience O
! O

Unique O
apppetizers B-AS
. O

The O
staff B-AS
has O
always O
been O
attentive O
and O
kind O
, O
and O
I O
' O
ve O
always O
been O
amazed O
at O
how O
they O
' O
ve O
handled O
all O
the O
various O
different O
group O
sizes O
that O
come O
in O
. O

IT O
is O
the O
best O
deal O
in O
town O
for O
a O
Monday O
night O
dinner B-AS
at O
a O
fine O
restaurant O
. O

Nothing O
special O
about O
this O
place O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
sandwiches B-AS
nearing O
$ O
7 O
did O
n't O
come O
with O
anything O
like O
chips B-AS
or O
a O
side B-AS
. O

and O
never O
strayed O
. O

The O
wait B-AS
here O
is O
long O
for O
dim B-AS
sum I-AS
, O
but O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
like O
sharing O
tables B-AS
or O
if O
the O
typical O
raucous O
dim B-AS
sum I-AS
atmosphere O
is O
not O
your O
gig O
, O
this O
is O
a O
sleek O
for O
Chinatown O
alternative O
. O

Leave O
the O
kids O
at O
home O
! O

This O
place O
has O
good O
potential O
, O
but O
needs O
a O
significa O
n't O
amount O
of O
work O
before O
we O
can O
justify O
spending O
that O
much O
money B-AS
on O
indian B-AS
food I-AS
you O
can O
get O
everywhere O
else O
. O

Everything O
is O
always O
cooked O
to O
perfection O
, O
the O
service B-AS
is O
excellent O
, O
the O
decor B-AS
cool O
and O
understated O
. O

And O
all O
of O
that O
wo O
n't O
break O
your O
bank O
! O

The O
Thai B-AS
food I-AS
is O
good O
. O

Just O
moved O
to O
the O
neighborhood O
and O
we O
' O
ve O
been O
trying O
all O
the O
West O
Village O
Sushi O
restaurants O
. O

Great O
selection B-AS
of I-AS
wine I-AS
, O
and O
seafood B-AS
. O

delicious O
. O

Acceptable O
prices B-AS
. O

Big O
thumbs O
up O
! O

we O
were O
seated O
at O
the O
sushi B-AS
bar I-AS
in O
front O
of O
yasuda O
. O

We O
have O
lived O
in O
Chelsea O
for O
two O
years O
and O
have O
never O
noticed O
this O
restaurant O
. O

As O
I O
made O
the O
title O
, O
it O
's O
an O
affordable O
restaurant O
for O
great O
taste B-AS
. O

They O
even O
scoop O
it O
out O
nice O
for O
those O
on O
a O
diet O
not O
too O
much O
not O
to O
little O
. O

Definitely O
not O
worth O
the O
price B-AS
! O

Orsay O
, O
is O
a O
very O
pleasnt O
throw O
back O
to O
traditional O
French B-AS
food I-AS
, O
and O
French O
service B-AS
as O
well O
. O

It O
's O
easy O
to O
get O
a O
table B-AS
for O
a O
large O
group O
and O
you O
do O
n't O
get O
hustled O
out O
. O

Great O
food B-AS
at O
reasonable O
prices B-AS
. O

Salads B-AS
are O
a O
delicious O
way O
to O
begin O
the O
meal B-AS
. O

I O
ordered O
tamarind B-AS
duck I-AS
and O
my O
wife O
ordered O
noodles B-AS
with I-AS
ground I-AS
beef I-AS
, O
and O
we O
were O
both O
delighted O
by O
the O
way O
the O
dishes B-AS
evoked O
Thai B-AS
flavors I-AS
in O
unexpected O
ways O
. O

That O
's O
why O
you O
have O
to O
pay O
more O
for O
that O
. O

If O
you O
' O
ve O
ever O
been O
along O
the O
river O
in O
Weehawken O
you O
have O
an O
idea O
of O
the O
top O
of O
view B-AS
the O
chart O
house O
has O
to O
offer O
. O

I O
loved O
it O
. O

They O
're O
are O
better O
Taiwanese O
restaurants O
and O
they O
are O
located O
in O
Flushing O
, O
Queens O
. O

The O
prices B-AS
are O
about O
$ O
9 O
for O
an O
entree B-AS
for O
dinner B-AS
and O
even O
less O
for O
lunch B-AS
. O

and O
you O
ca O
n't O
beat O
the O
prices B-AS
. O

but O
I O
would O
n't O
wan O
na O
live O
there O
. O

Arigato O
Gozimas O
Yuka O
! O

Should O
you O
happen O
to O
be O
impressed O
by O
the O
cuisine B-AS
definitely O
try O
it O
. O

I O
had O
the O
black B-AS
cod I-AS
with I-AS
yuzu I-AS
sauce I-AS
, O
which O
was O
wonderful O
. O

Prices B-AS
too O
high O
for O
this O
cramped O
and O
unappealing O
resturant O
. O

Tuk O
Tuk O
is O
one O
of O
the O
rare O
choices O
for O
me O
to O
go O
in O
Brooklyn O
. O

This O
quiet O
dark O
asian O
bistro O
is O
well O
worth O
the O
trip O
. O

I O
knew O
upon O
visiting O
NYC O
that O
I O
wanted O
to O
try O
an O
orginal O
deli O
. O

I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
this O
place O
! O

Total O
hipster O
- O
wannabe O
attitude O
in O
an O
otherwise O
sweet O
spot B-AS
. O

Yes O
, O
there O
might O
be O
a O
wait B-AS
if O
you O
have O
no O
reservations B-AS
. O

Thank O
You O
Emilio O

First O
of O
all O
Dal O
Bukhara O
Rocks O
. O

Everything O
, O
from O
the O
soft O
bread B-AS
, O
soggy O
salad B-AS
, O
and O
50 O
minute O
wait B-AS
time O
, O
with O
an O
incredibly O
rude O
service B-AS
to O
deliver O
below O
average O
food B-AS
. O

i O
asked O
for O
them O
spicy O
and O
they O
were O
delicious O
. O

It O
is O
terrific O
, O
as O
is O
the O
value O
. O

The O
sicilian B-AS
is O
my O
favorite O
it O
is O
moist O
not O
dry O
like O
most O
places O
but O
all O
their O
pizza B-AS
is O
great O
! O

Downstairs B-AS
lounge I-AS
is O
always O
a O
good O
attraction O

The O
menu B-AS
prices I-AS
are O
a O
bit O
expensive O
for O
what O
you O
get O
in O
quality B-AS
and O
portion B-AS
size I-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
amazing O
, O
and O
the O
service B-AS
was O
prompt O
and O
helpful O
, O
but O
not O
over O
- O
bearing O
or O
rushed O
. O

food B-AS
was O
delivered O
by O
a O
busboy B-AS
, O
not O
waiter B-AS
We O
got O
no O
cheese B-AS
offered O
for O
the O
pasta B-AS
, O
our O
water B-AS
and I-AS
wine I-AS
glasses I-AS
remained O
EMPTY O
our O
entire O
meal B-AS
, O
when O
we O
would O
have O
easily O
spent O
another O
$ O
20 O
on O
wine B-AS
. O

The O
takeout B-AS
is O
great O
too O
since O
they O
give O
high O
quality O
tupperware O
as O
well O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
not O
fresh O
, O
the O
sauces B-AS
were O
bland O
and O
very O
oily O
. O

Off O
the O
beaten O
path O
, O
this O
jewel O
of O
a O
restaurant O
shines O
just O
one O
block O
away O
from O
the O
plethora O
of O
6th O
street O
Indian O
restaurants O
. O

Could O
be O
pricey O
without O
a O
prix B-AS
fixe I-AS
meal I-AS
. O

This O
is O
definitely O
an O
excellent O
date O
spot B-AS
because O
of O
the O
ambiance B-AS
and O
on O
the O
weekends O
the O
night B-AS
scene I-AS
is O
more O
than O
alive O
. O

I O
would O
defiantly O
come O
back O
here O
again O
as O
one O
of O
my O
top O
choices O
. O

One O
of O
us O
actually O
liked O
the O
expresso B-AS
, O
that O
's O
it O
. O

Everyone O
was O
more O
then O
happy O
with O
his O
choices O
. O

Again O
, O
the O
waitress B-AS
was O
awesome O
. O

Worth O
the O
trip O
from O
Manhattan O
. O

I O
loved O
everythig O
about O
it O
- O
especially O
the O
shows B-AS
and O
actors B-AS
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
fast O
and O
friendly O
and O
the O
food B-AS
was O
very O
tasty O
and O
they O
had O
the O
best O
hot B-AS
sauce I-AS
to O
add O
to O
your O
meals B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
just O
OK O
, O
I O
would O
never O
go O
back O
. O

Zero O
ambiance B-AS
to O
boot O
. O

Got O
a O
little O
loud O
after O
8 O
pm O
when O
the O
joint O
got O
full O
. O

Scalina O
Fedeli O
reminded O
me O
why O
service B-AS
is O
so O
integral O
to O
fine O
dining B-AS
. O

i O
recommend O
the O
thai B-AS
popcorn I-AS
, O

I O
ca O
n't O
wait O
for O
the O
nex O
time O
. O

Everything O

the O
drinks B-AS
, O
the O
decor B-AS
, O
the O
food B-AS
, O
even O
the O

As O
soon O
as O
my O
father O
lifted O
his O
pen O
from O
the O
check B-AS
a O
chef B-AS
appeared O
to O
usher O
us O
out O
. O

The O
parathas B-AS
and O
kebabs B-AS
are O
made O
when O
ordered O
ensuring O
a O
level O
of O
freshness O
that O
is O
unsurpassed O
. O

Great O
neighborhood O
joint O
. O

The O
tuna B-AS
and O
wasabe B-AS
potatoes I-AS
are O
excellent O
. O

The O
only O
disappointment O
was O
the O
coat B-AS
check I-AS
girls I-AS
who O
did O
n't O
seem O
to O
know O
what O
a O
customer O

busy O
night O

My O

me O
to O
Scopa O

Ummmthe O
beer B-AS

cold O
. O

I O
take O
all O
my O
NYC O
guests O
to O

. O

It O
is O
sometimes O
a O
little O
cramped O
, O
and O

get O
a O
little O
warm O
, O
but O
hello O

We O

great O
desserts B-AS
including O
the O
best O
cannoli B-AS

they O
offered O
an O
after B-AS
dinner I-AS
drink I-AS
, O
on O
the O
house O
. O

Good O
crowd O
, O
good O
outdoor B-AS
seating I-AS
, O
with O
a O
hip O
japanese O
vibe B-AS
. O

Even O
with O
the O
prix O
fixe O
pricing O
, O
this O
restaurant O
is O
not O
worth O
it O
. O

We O
asked O
to O
be O
moved O
which O
took O
half O
an O
hour O
, O
and O
then O
were O
seated O
in O
a O
high O
traffic O
area B-AS
in O
the O
back O
, O
even O
though O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
room B-AS
was O
practically O
empty O
. O

Good O
to O
find O
a O
restaurant O
where O
the O
owners B-AS
have O
some O
imagination O
and O
they O
have O
actually O
pulled O
it O
off O
, O
like O
in O
this O
case O
. O

However O
, O
their O
popularity O
has O
yet O
to O
slow O
down O
, O
and O
I O
still O
find O
myself O
drawn O
to O
their O
ambiance B-AS
and O
delectable O
reputation O
. O

Where O
tanks B-AS
in O
other O
Chinatown O
restaurants O
display O
a O
lurking O
myriad O
of O
sad O
- O
looking O
marine O
life O
in O
their O
murky O
waters O
, O
the O
tanks B-AS
at O
Ping O
's O
are O
clear O
as O
glass O
with O
healthy O
- O
looking O
creatures O
who O
do O
not O
yet O
know O
that O
they O
will O
be O
part O
of O
some O
dim B-AS
sum I-AS
lover O
's O
brunch B-AS
. O

The O
Halibut B-AS
was O
too O
salty O
, O
dessert B-AS
was O
so O
so O
do O
n't O
waste O
any O
of O
your O
calories O
and O
service B-AS
was O
poor O
. O

The O
view B-AS
is O
spectacular O
, O
and O
the O
food B-AS
is O
great O
. O

The O
place O
was O
n't O
too O
hard O
to O
find O
, O
but O
it O
was O
kind O
of O
packed O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
my O
boyfriend O
and O
I O
got O
our O
food B-AS
, O
the O
line O
reached O
the O
door O
. O

Good O
bagels B-AS
and O
good O
cream B-AS
cheese I-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
wonderful O
, O
tasty O
and O
filling O
, O
and O
the O
service B-AS
is O
professional O
and O
friendly O
. O

It O
is O
also O
extremely O
well O
priced B-AS
. O

Always O
great O
service B-AS
! O

I O
am O
happy O
i O
did O
the O
food B-AS
was O
awsome O
. O

I O
have O
been O
in O
many O
restaurants O
all O
over O
the O
city O
and O
Roth O
's O
Steakhouse O
has O
quickly O
become O
one O
of O
my O
favorites O
. O

We O
ordered O
the O
chicken B-AS
casserole I-AS
, O
but O
what O
we O
got O
were O
a O
few O
small O
pieces O
of O
chicken B-AS
, O
all O
dark O
meat B-AS
and O
on O
the O
bone O
. O

A O
bit O
breezy O
up O
there O
on O
the O
mezzanine B-AS
from O
the O
wind O
coming O
from O
the O
tracks O
. O

I O
went O
to O
DF O
for O
Valentines B-AS
Day I-AS
dinner I-AS
. O

I O
recommend O
the O
jelly B-AS
fish I-AS
, O
drunken B-AS
chicken I-AS
and O
the O
soupy B-AS
dumplings I-AS
, O
certainly O
the O
stir B-AS
fry I-AS
blue I-AS
crab I-AS
. O

I O
LOVED O
THE O
SHOWS B-AS
. O

and O
i O
have O
been O
around O
the O
block O
, O
to O
say O
the O
very O
least O
. O

We O
could O
have O
made O
a O
meal B-AS
of O
the O
yummy O
dumplings B-AS
from O
the O
dumpling B-AS
menu I-AS
. O

The O
aesthetics B-AS
of O
this O
place B-AS
are O
like O
an O
airport O
lounge O
. O

Then O
, O
get O
ripped O
on O
free O
box B-AS
wine I-AS
. O

My O
wife O
and O
I O
ate O
here O
earlier O
this O
week O
and O
have O
not O
stopped O
ranting O
and O
raving O
about O
the O
food B-AS
. O

If O
you O
do O
n't O
mind O
pre O
- O
sliced O
low O
quality O
fish B-AS
, O
unfriendly O
staff B-AS
and O
a O
sushi B-AS
chef I-AS
that O
looks O
like O
he O
is O
miserable O
then O
this O
is O
your O
place O
. O

The O
food B-AS
itself O
was O
just O
ok O
, O
nothing O
spectacular O
, O
but O
the O
service B-AS
was O
awful O
. O

The O
pizza B-AS
is O
yummy O
and O
I O
like O
the O
atmoshpere B-AS
. O

As O
there O
were O
so O
many O
to O
choose O
from O
we O
wandered O
up O
and O
down O
the O
street O
looking O
in O
the O
windows O
and O
such O
noticicing O
many O
empty O
seats B-AS
, O
except O
at O
Taj O
Mahal O
. O

Also O
, O
do O
n't O
plan O
on O
asking O
for O
your O
favorite O
roll B-AS
, O
if O
it O
's O
not O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
you O
ca O
n't O
have O
it O
. O

Give O
it O
a O
try O
and O
enjoy O
. O

and O
that O
's O
saying O
a O
lot O
. O

those O
rolls O
were O
big O
, O
but O
not O
good O
and O
sashimi B-AS
was O
n't O
fresh O
. O

The O
pesto B-AS
pizza I-AS
was O
excellent O
, O
thin B-AS
- I-AS
crust I-AS
pizza I-AS
with O
a O
nice O
amount O
of O
spicy O
Italian B-AS
cheese I-AS
that O
I O
'd O
never O
heard O
of O
before O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
could O
get O
attention O
from O
was O
one O
of O
at O
least O
two O
cats O
running O
around O
that O
kept O
batting O
at O
my O
table O
. O

if O
your O
into O
thaiyou O
can O
not O
miss O
this O
great O
restaurant O
. O

Going O
to O
Ballato O
's O
is O
like O
coming O
home O
and O
eating O
in O
my O
own O
kitchen O
, O
an O
absolute O
delight O
! O

try O
the O
spicy O
shrimp B-AS
appetizer I-AS
again O
, O
not O
the O
greatest O
value O
in O
the O
world O
but O
worth O
the O
price O
and O
the O
lamb B-AS
vindaloo I-AS
is O
great O
. O

However O
, O
go O
for O
the O
ambience B-AS
, O
and O
consider O
the O
food B-AS
just O
a O
companion O
for O
a O
trip O
across O
the O
world O
! O

I O
think O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
more O
underrated O
places O
in O
the O
city O
. O

for O
out O
- O
of O
- O
towners O
who O
will O
get O
a O
big O
thrill O
out O
of O
the O
location O
! O

Everyone O
that O
has O
ever O
come O
here O
with O
me O
has O
become O
a O
convert O
and O
returned O
regularly O
with O
their O
own O
friends O
. O

Food O
was O
good O
not O
great O
not O
worth O
the O
wait B-AS
or O
another O
visit O

I O
go O
at O
least O
3 O
times O
a O
month O
and O
have O
never O
been O
disappointed O
. O

Obviously O
the O
Chinese O
translation O
of O
this O
place O
does O
not O
mean O
Big O
Wong O
, O
it O
actually O
means O
Great O
Prosperity O
. O

I O
think O
the O
restaurant O
was O
too O
loud O
when O
full O
to O
be O
romantic O
. O

I O
have O
had O
so O
many O
dinners B-AS
here O
and O
it O
's O
always O
been O
perfect O
, O
on O
a O
date O
with O
my O
husband O
, O
with O
my O
mom O
, O
with O
girlfriends O
and O
larger O
groups O
. O

When O
you O
want O
a O
piece O
of O
beef B-AS
, O
head O
on O
over O
. O

Delicate O
spices B-AS
, O
onions B-AS
, O
eggs B-AS
and O
a O
kick O
- O
ass O
roti B-AS
. O

Incredible O
food B-AS
at O
a O
very O
agreable O
price B-AS
brings O
me O
back O
just O
about O
every O
other O
day O
to O
this O
authentic O
Thai O
restaurant O
. O

I O
actually O
gave O
Patroon O
another O
chance O
before O
writing O
this O
, O
but O
the O
second O
visit O
was O
even O
worse O
. O

Also O
, O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
sit O
at O
a O
certain O
table B-AS
, O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
! O

Unbelievable O
. O

A O
little O
pricey O
but O
it O
really O
hits O
the O
spot O
on O
a O
Sunday O
morning O
! O

I O
' O
ve O
been O
living O
in O
the O
Columbia O
University O
area O
for O
about O
10 O
years O
with O
3 O
kids O
, O
now O
in O
their O
teens O
. O

The O
menu B-AS
has O
lots O
of O
options O
, O
I O
hope O
to O
go O
back O
to O
try O
those O
potato B-AS
pancakes I-AS
. O

As O
soon O
as O
I O
wake O
up O
on O
a O
saturday O
or O
sunday O
it O
is O
the O
first O
thing O
on O
my O
mind O
is O
when O
and O
how O
I O
will O
be O
getting O
to O
fried B-AS
dumpling I-AS
. O

The O
staff B-AS
is O
n't O
the O
friendliest O
or O
most O
competent O
, O
and O
I O
am O
stickler O
for O
service B-AS
, O
but O
everything O
else O
about O
this O
place O
makes O
up O
for O
it O
. O

My O
wife O
and O
I O
will O
usually O
only O
order O
one O
primi B-AS
and O
one O
secondi B-AS
and O
split O
them O
, O
as O
they O
tend O
to O
offer O
large O
portions B-AS
. O

This O
restaurant O
was O
way O
overhyped O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
overheard O
comments O
from O
him O
to O
his O
employees B-AS
that O
should O
not O
have O
been O
delivered O
in O
the O
dining B-AS
area I-AS
and O
I O
' O
ve O
been O
sitting O
there O
while O
he O
lectured O
another O
customer O
. O

Delicious O
crab B-AS
cakes I-AS
too O
. O

Now O
at O
the O
top O
of O
our O
list O
, O
Del O
Frisco O
's O
Steakhouse O
. O

I O
can O
not O
imagine O
you O
not O
rushing O
out O
to O
eat O
there O
. O

This O
was O
the O
worst O
dining B-AS
experience I-AS
I O
' O
ve O
ever O
had O
. O

I O
have O
been O
coming O
here O
for O
years O
and O
have O
nothing O
but O
good O
things O
to O
say O
about O
the O
service B-AS
and O
the O
great O
staff B-AS
at O
La O
Lanterna O
. O

Just O
bring O
someone O
who O
speaks O
Cantonese O
because O
waiter B-AS
may O
not O
understand O
you O
. O

I O
thought O
I O
had O
died O
and O
gone O
to O
heaven O
. O

Not O
someplace O
I O
would O
seek O
to O
try O
out O
but O
if O
I O
am O
in O
the O
area O
again O
, O
I O
will O
certainly O
stop O
by O
. O

The O
bruschetta B-AS
and O
panini B-AS
's O
are O
so O
yummy O
! O

Food B-AS
was O
okay O
, O
nothing O
great O
. O

Every O
waitress B-AS
and O
customer O
who O
passed O
by O
me O
bumped O
into O
my O
chair O
. O

I O
have O
been O
going O
there O
since O
it O
opened O
and O
I O
ca O
n't O
get O
enough O
. O

Always O
popular O
, O
always O
full O
, O
always O
a O
wait B-AS
. O

In O
fact O
, O
you O
ca O
n't O
miss O
it O
. O

I O
recently O
tried O
Suan O
and O
I O
thought O
that O
it O
was O
great O
. O

A O
little O
noise O
but O
I O
think O
that O
was O
because O
of O
our O
party O
! O

It O
is O
run O
by O
the O
same O
Sichuan B-AS
chef I-AS
who O
started O
the O
chain O
in O
Chinatown O
. O

Get O
the O
feeling O
they O
settled O
into O
a O
groove O
a O
while O
ago O
. O

If O
the O
omakase O
is O
to O
showcase O
technique O
and O
variety O
, O
serving B-AS
almost O
40 O
% O
of O
items O
BBQ O
- O
ed O
and O
a O
spicy B-AS
tuna I-AS
roll I-AS
wrapped O
with O
not O
- O
so O
- O
fresh O
nori B-AS
seems O
to O
be O
a O
rather O
limp O
performance O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
wait O
for O
summer O
, O
when O
they O
serve O
outside O
on O
their O
gigantic O
patio B-AS
. O

Best O
Pastrami B-AS
I O
ever O
had O
and O
great O
portion B-AS
without O
being O
ridiculous O
. O

If O
you O
are O
someone O
who O
appreciates O
the O
same O
things O
but O
hope O
to O
have O
food B-AS
to O
spare O
or O
share O
, O
Kai O
may O
not O
be O
the O
best O
option O
. O

go O
here O
for O
the O
drinks B-AS
! O

I O
do O
n't O
get O
it O
, O
what O
's O
so O
special O
about O
Prune O
? O

I O
'd O
definitely O
recommend O
this O
little O
place O
. O

Again O
, O
if O
you O
are O
in O
this O
neighborhood O
, O
by O
all O
means O
, O
come O
here O
. O

The O
first O
2 O
courses B-AS
were O
very O
good O
, O
but O
the O
chocolate B-AS
sampler I-AS
was O
too O
rich O
for O
me O
and O
the O
dessert B-AS
wine I-AS
far O
too O
sweet O
. O

Butter B-AS
was O
melted O
, O
white B-AS
wine I-AS
warm O
, O
cheese B-AS
oozing O
everywhere O
. O

We O
had O
a O
party O
in O
their O
private B-AS
room I-AS
and O
they O
made O
it O
truly O
memorable O
and O
were O
very O
helpful O
in O
the O
planning O
. O

Do O
yourself O
a O
favor O
and O
walk O
the O
extra O
avenue O
from O
joe O
's O
to O
eat O
here O
. O

It O
can O
not O
be O
the O
ambience B-AS
, O
because O
the O
place B-AS
is O
very O
cramped O
and O
some O
guests O
have O
to O
sit O
in O
an O
aisle B-AS
. O

I O
have O
eaten O
at O
Shabu O
Tatsu O
at O
least O
5 O
times O
and O
I O
always O
want O
to O
go O
back O
for O
more O
! O

We O
were O
disappointed O
with O
the O
pre B-AS
- I-AS
fixe I-AS
menu I-AS
of O
only O
2 O
choices B-AS
per I-AS
course I-AS
other O
restaurants O
offer O
3 O
choices O
and O
ended O
up O
ordering B-AS
a I-AS
la I-AS
carte I-AS
. O

Authentic O
Pakistani B-AS
food I-AS
. O

The O
staff B-AS
has O
always O
been O
friendly O
without O
seeming O
grating O
, O
and O
the O
chef B-AS
has O
greeted O
us O
on O
a O
couple O
of O
occasions O
. O

Get O
it O
together O
. O

The O
eggplant B-AS
parmesan I-AS
is O
also O
great O
, O
and O
my O
friend O
who O
grew O
up O
in O
Manhattan O
claims O
that O
no O
one O
serves B-AS
a O
better O
baked B-AS
ziti I-AS
with I-AS
meatsauce I-AS
. O

Quality O
ingredients B-AS
preparation O
all O
around O
, O
and O
a O
very O
fair O
price B-AS
for O
NYC O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
very O
good O
, O
prompt O
, O
attentive O
and O
non O
- O
intrusive O
. O

My O
entree B-AS
of O
hot B-AS
pot I-AS
with I-AS
seafood I-AS
was O
full O
of O
imitation O
crabmeat B-AS
with O
a O
couple O
pieces O
of O
shrimp B-AS
and O
squid B-AS
, O
and O
was O
unnecessarily O
heated O
with O
a O
burner O
. O

We O
began O
with O
the O
cheese B-AS
fondue I-AS
the O
artisanal O
blend O
and O
added O
apples B-AS
and O
kielbasa B-AS
to O
dip O
. O

In O
such O
a O
crappy O
part O
of O
town O
to O
find O
a O
good O
value B-AS
for O
lunch B-AS
, O
this O
place O
is O
great O
. O

Its O
not O
curry B-AS
in O
a O
slurry O
crap O
, O
and O
regular O
run O
of O
the O
mill O
food B-AS
. O

In O
fact O
, O
while O
leaving O
the O
place O
we O
saw O
two O
people O
looking O
at O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
and O
I O
could O
n't O
help O
telling O
them O
that O
the O
food B-AS
was O
horrible O
. O

Even O
though O
the O
restaurant O
was O
packed O
, O
we O
were O
seated B-AS
promptly O
and O
even O
asked O
for O
a O
table B-AS
upstairs O
with O
no O
problems O
. O

If O
you O
want O
Americanized O
Chinese B-AS
food I-AS
with O
your O
usual O
watery O
, O
generic O
white B-AS
sauce I-AS
, O
this O
is O
your O
place O
. O

The O
bread B-AS
is O
the O
soft O
paratha O
bread B-AS
unlike O
the O
plain O
bread B-AS
they O
use O
in O
Calcutta O
, O
and O
the O
stuffing B-AS
is O
tandoori B-AS
styled O
and O
very O
flavorful O
. O

Service B-AS
is O
friendly O
, O
prices B-AS
are O
good O
, O
delivery B-AS
time I-AS
was O
a O
little O
slow O
, O
but O
for O
the O
way O
this O
pizza B-AS
tastes O
, O
I O
' O
m O
willing O
to O
overlook O
it O
. O

The O
food B-AS
can O
get O
price B-AS
but O
the O
prixe O
fixe O
tasting O
menu O
is O
the O
greatest O
food B-AS
for O
a O
good O
price B-AS
and O
they O
cater O
the O
food B-AS
to O
any O
food B-AS
allergies O
or O
food B-AS
you O
do O
n't O
like O
. O

The O
service B-AS
is O
excellent O
, O
the O
decor B-AS
is O
great O
, O
and O
the O
food B-AS
is O
delicious O
and O
comes O
in O
large O
portions B-AS
. O

A O
word O
to O
the O
wise O
, O
the O
Hoboken O
health O
inspector O
clued O
me O
to O
his O
findings O
that O
this O
is O
THE O
cleanest O
restaurant O
in O
town O
. O

An O
excellent O
service B-AS

The O
food B-AS
however O
, O
is O
what O
one O
might O
expect O
. O

I O
LOVE O
their O
Thai B-AS
noodles I-AS
with I-AS
shrimp I-AS
and I-AS
chicken I-AS
and I-AS
coconut I-AS
juice I-AS
is O
the O
MUST O
! O

I O
must O
give O
it O
Yon O
out O
of O
Yon O
stars O
! O

The O
pizza B-AS
was O
really O
good O
. O

The O
only O
possible O
drawback O
to O
this O
last O
point O
is O
that O
as O
of O
the O
date O
of O
this O
posting O
, O
the O
additional O
menu B-AS
items I-AS
are O
only O
written O
in O
Chinese O
. O

Food B-AS
is O
average O
, O
and O
I O
would O
say O
even O
the O
chain O
restaurant O
Baluchi O
's O
tastes O
better O
. O

The O
place B-AS
is O
small O
and O
cramped O
but O
the O
food B-AS
is O
fantastic O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
tasty O
and O
portion B-AS
sizes I-AS
are O
appropriate O
. O

A O
little O
crowded O
but O
they O
move O
that O
line O
really O
fast O
! O

Enjoy O
! O
! O
! O

Kosher B-AS
dills I-AS
are O
the O
perfect O
compliment O
for O
your O
unforgetable O
sandwich B-AS
and O
they O
give O
you O
plenty O
of O
them O
. O

Kudos O
to O
Po O
! O

The O
entertainment B-AS
was O
great O
they O
have O
shows B-AS
that O
go O
on O
through O
out O
the O
dinner B-AS
. O

My O
boyfriend O
and O
I O
were O
in O
NY O
for O
a O
few O
days O
and O
Pastis O
was O
a O
place O
that O
came O
recommended O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
so O
cheap O
and O
the O
waiters B-AS
are O
nice O
. O

The O
food B-AS
there O
is O
so O
good O
that O
even O
to O
order O
out O
the O
wait B-AS
is O
incredible O
. O

The O
bartender B-AS
on O
my O
most O
recent O
visit O
was O
so O
incredibly O
rude O
that O
I O
will O
never O
go O
back O
. O

Their O
sushi B-AS
, O
Kamikaze B-AS
and O
other O
Rolls B-AS
are O
fresh O
and O
well O
presented O
. O

For O
authentic O
Thai B-AS
food I-AS
, O
look O
no O
further O
than O
Toons O
. O

It O
's O
true O
, O
you O
feel O
like O
your O
in O
a O
scene O
from O
Goodfellas O
. O

I O
read O
the O
other O
review O
and O
have O
to O
say O
I O
had O
the O
opposite O
experience O
here O
last O
Sunday O
. O

The O
highlight O
of O
the O
night O
was O
the O
mayonaisse B-AS
for O
my O
side O
of O
fries B-AS
I O
received O
from O
one O
of O
the O
food B-AS
runners I-AS
, O
which O
is O
not O
good O
considering O
the O
bill B-AS
was O
nearly O
$ O
100 O
. O

I O
choose O
to O
go O
with O
one O
of O
the O
special B-AS
, O
the O
braised B-AS
lamb I-AS
shank I-AS
in I-AS
red I-AS
wine I-AS
, O
which O
was O
excellent O
. O

If O
anyones O
has O
doubt O
of O
not O
knowing O
enough O
about O
wines B-AS
, O
please O
check O
their O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
. O

Never O
again O
! O

The O
only O
concern O
i O
have O
is O
with O
the O
slighly O
all O
- O
business O
waitstaff B-AS
who O
order O
and O
throw O
the O
food B-AS
down O
, O
rushing O
you O
out O
. O

Have O
the O
iced B-AS
tea I-AS
. O

For O
Park O
avenue O
I O
expected O
so O
much O
more O
. O

Small O
servings B-AS
for O
main O
entree B-AS
, O
i O
had O
salmon B-AS
was O
nt O
impressed O
girlfriend O
had O
chicken B-AS
, O
it O
was O
good O
. O

So O
rude O
. O

you O
can O
actually O
get O
2 O
salads B-AS
worth O
if O
u O
take O
it O
home O
and O
add O
it O
to O
some O
lettuce B-AS
! O

The O
ambience B-AS
is O
very O
romantic O
and O
definitely O
a O
good O
place B-AS
to O
bring O
a O
date O
. O

They O
are O
FAST O
. O

It O
is O
far O
more O
popular O
as O
a O
bar B-AS
than O
as O
a O
restaurant O
, O
with O
only O
a O
few O
tables B-AS
and O
the O
waiter B-AS
being O
the O
bar B-AS
, O
but O
we O
greatly O
enjoyed O
the O
unobtrusive O
atmosphere B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
very O
good O
for O
it O
's O
price B-AS
, O
better O
than O
most O
fried B-AS
dumplings I-AS
I O
' O
ve O
had O
. O

There O
are O
much O
better O
places O
in O
NY O
with O
better O
prices B-AS
. O

Very O
neighborhoody O
, O
very O
quick O
and O
sufficient O
. O

Obv B-AS
caviar I-AS
is O
top O
of O
the O
line O
but O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
menu B-AS
is O
so O
diverse O
it O
gives O
you O
a O
chance O
to O
taste O
so O
manydifferent O
varietys O
. O

I O
ate O
here O
a O
week O
ago O
and O
found O
most O
dishes B-AS
average O
at O
best O
and O
too O
expensive O
. O

Everything O
is O
delicious O
, O
though O
, O
my O
gf O
and O
I O
come O
here O
once O
a O
week O
sometimes O
you O
will O
get O
addicted O
! O

And O
I O
could O
do O
without O
the O
cigar O
smoke O
. O

Still O
, O
try O
it O
once O
, O
since O
if O
you O
end O
up O
loving O
the O
food B-AS
, O
it O
could O
be O
one O
of O
your O
best O
dining B-AS
experiences I-AS
. O

I O
' O
ve O
waited O
over O
one O
hour O
for O
food B-AS
. O

Other O
guests O
enjoyed O
pizza B-AS
, O
santa B-AS
fe I-AS
chopped I-AS
salad I-AS
and O
fish B-AS
and I-AS
chips I-AS
. O

The O
ambience B-AS
is O
very O
calm O
and O
quiet O
. O

Both O
times O
I O
was O
extremely O
dissappointed O
by O
the O
service B-AS
, O
which O
was O
boarderline O
rude O
. O

Stay O
away O
from O
the O
latter O
since O
you O
wo O
n't O
go O
for O
seconds O
hint O
hint O
. O

not O
only O
does O
make O
the O
best O
pizza B-AS
in O
NY O
, O
maybe O
anywhere O
. O

The O
spicy O
Tuna B-AS
roll I-AS
is O
huge O
and O
probably O
the O
best O
that O
I O
' O
ve O
had O
at O
this O
price B-AS
range I-AS
. O

Price B-AS
and O
quality B-AS
of O
fish B-AS
alone O
will O
keep O
us O
from O
making O
a O
return O
visit O
. O

Our O
waiter B-AS
and O
all O
of O
the O
people O
helping O
him O
were O
attentive O
and O
genuine O
. O

The O
place B-AS
is O
a O
BISTRO O
which O
means O
, O
simple O
dishes B-AS
and O
wine B-AS
served I-AS
efficiently O
in O
a O
bustling O
atmosphere B-AS
. O

This O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
comfort B-AS
food I-AS
places O
in O
the O
city O
. O

Overall O
, O
the O
ingredients B-AS
and O
technique B-AS
are O
there O
and O
I O
am O
encouraged O
enough O
to O
return O
at O
lunch B-AS
or O
dinner B-AS
to O
see O
whether O
the O
boldness O
of O
the O
flavour O
palette O
improves O
. O

I O
had O
a O
huge O
pastrami B-AS
sandwich I-AS
on O
a O
roll O
. O

Though O
you O
will O
undoubtedly O
be O
seated O
at O
a O
table B-AS
with O
what O
seems O
like O
barely O
enough O
room B-AS
no O
matter O
what O
the O
size O
of O
your O
party O
, O
the O
warm O
atomosphere B-AS
is O
worth O
the O
cramped O
quarters O
you O
'll O
have O
fun O
and O
forgot O
about O
the O
tight O
spot B-AS
you O
're O
in O
. O

The O
fish B-AS
was O
not O
fresh O
and O
the O
rice B-AS
tasted O
old O
and O
stale O
. O

Considering O
their O
price B-AS
of O
$ O
625 O
for O
lunch B-AS
special I-AS
, O
the O
dish B-AS
was O
ridiculously O
small O
. O

This O
is O
the O
pinnacle O
of O
Indian B-AS
Fast I-AS
Food I-AS
all O
fast O
foods O
in O
my O
opinion O
. O

Besides O
, O
when O
you O
have O
bad O
service B-AS
, O
that O
's O
less O
money B-AS
you O
have O
to O
tip B-AS
. O

We O
do O
not O
need O
to O
go O
to O
a O
four O
- O
star O
restaurant O
anymore O
. O

The O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
is O
also O
really O
nice O
. O

I O
thanked O
my O
friend O
who O
recommended O
me O
this O
restaurant O
and O
will O
certainly O
recommend O
it O
to O
others O
. O

I O
plan O
on O
stopping O
by O
next O
week O
as O
well O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
devine O
, O
oysters B-AS
where O
a O
sensual O
as O
they O
come O
, O
and O
the O
price B-AS
ca O
n't O
be O
beat O
! O
! O
! O

Compared O
to O
Ess O
- O
a O
, O
Tal O
offers O
a O
less O
doughy O
bagel B-AS
! O

Ballato O
's O
is O
consistently O
delicious O
authentic O
italian B-AS
food I-AS
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
attentive O
, O
yet O
discreet O
. O

As O
a O
retired O
hipster O
, O
I O
can O
say O
with O
some O
degree O
of O
certainty O
that O
for O
the O
last O
year O
Lucky O
Strike O
has O
been O
the O
best O
laid O
- O
back O
late O
night O
in O
the O
city O
. O

For O
those O
prices B-AS
and O
the O
dressed O
up O
atmosphere B-AS
you O
expect O
more O
and O
should O
get O
more O
. O

Then O
, O
IF O
they O
answer O
the O
phone O
, O
you O
're O
lucky O
if O
they O
do O
n't O
hang O
up O
on O
you O
! O

They O
offer O
the O
same O
menu B-AS
but O
have O
creative O
drinks B-AS
that O
are O
loaded O
with O
alcohol O
and O
cheeky O
names O
- O
but O
they O
do O
cost O
you O
. O

We O
went O
to O
eat O
at O
the O
Jekyll O
and O
Hyde O
restaurant O
on O
Friday O
night O
and O
really O
enjoyed O
the O
fun O
atmosphere B-AS
and O
good O
food B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
pretty O
tradional O
but O
it O
was O
hot O
and O
good O
with O
large O
portions B-AS
. O

Highly O
recommended O
to O
all O
! O

highly O
recommended O
. O

Unless O
you O
are O
eating O
in O
the O
Pizzeria O
side O
of O
this O
place B-AS
, O
and O
are O
not O
in O
a O
rush O
, O
this O
place B-AS
is O
a O
bad O
idea O
. O

You O
have O
to O
increase O
the O
service B-AS
a O
lot O
. O

Ambiance B-AS
is O
barely O
romantic O
but O
management B-AS
tries O
. O

I O
must O
warn O
the O
reader O
that O
the O
portions B-AS
sizes O
are O
very O
small O
especially O
the O
appetizers B-AS
, O
so O
if O
you O
plan O
to O
eat O
until O
you O
are O
full O
and O
do O
not O
intend O
to O
order O
the O
chef B-AS
's O
special O
tasting O
menu B-AS
, O
prepare O
to O
order O
and O
pay O
for O
an O
appetizer B-AS
1 O
dish B-AS
for O
each O
person O
because O
the O
portions B-AS
are O
not O
for O
sharing O
, O
a O
main B-AS
entree I-AS
, O
and O
the O
cold B-AS
udon I-AS
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
meal O
. O

They O
were O
very O
abrupt O
with O
me O
when O
I O
called O
and O
actually O
claimed O
the O
food B-AS
was O
late O
because O
they O
were O
out O
of O
rice B-AS
. O

After O
we O
got O
our O
sashimi B-AS
order O
, O
I O
could O
not O
believe O
how O
small O
the O
portions B-AS
were O
! O

After O
the O
main B-AS
course I-AS
came O
, O
we O
did O
n't O
see O
our O
waiter B-AS
for O
at O
least O
40 O
MINUTES O
! O

It O
will O
be O
on O
my O
to O
do O
list O
the O
next O
visit O
to O
NYC O
. O

Nothing O
better O
than O
buying O
a O
snapple B-AS
for O
$ O
325 O
too O
. O

When O
family O
came O
in O
he O
gave O
them O
apps B-AS
to O
test O
their O
palets O
, O
and O
then O
ordered O
for O
them O
. O

I O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised O
to O
find O
this O
gem O
in O
Hoboken O
. O

Service B-AS
is O
extraordinary O
, O
yet O
not O
overbearing O
, O
and O
the O
decor B-AS
brings O
a O
taste O
of O
trendy O
SoHo O
into O
Queens O
. O

The O
dosas B-AS
are O
skimpy O
, O
unattractive O
and O
drip O
with O
grease O
, O
and O
personally O
I O
'd O
drink O
popcorn B-AS
topping I-AS
before O
I O
'd O
eat O
another O
one O
of O
these O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
excellent O
and O
the O
food B-AS
was O
delicious O
. O

If O
I O
wanted O
to O
deal O
with O
a O
crappy O
scene B-AS
and O
annoying O
customers B-AS
I O
'd O
go O
out O
in O
Manhattan O
. O

After O
a O
seafood B-AS
craving O
, O
i O
checked O
citysearch O
and O
chose O
to O
go O
to O
Fish O
based O
on O
a O
previous O
review O
and O
the O
citysearch O
info O
. O

Right O
off O
the O
major O
deegan O
you O
get O
ladies B-AS
from O
all O
over O
the O
city O
. O

Until O
you O
realize O
that O
their O
five O
minutes O
is O
meaningless O
and O
your O
wait B-AS
may O
be O
anywhere O
from O
two O
to O
twenty O
minutes O
it O
may O
be O
frustrating O
. O

always O
fresh O
and O
delicious O
. O

The O
food O
was O
very O
good O
, O
but O
not O
very O
thai O
. O

Thalia O
is O
a O
beautiful O
restaurant O
with O
beautiful O
people B-AS
serving I-AS
you O
, O
but O
the O
food B-AS
does O
n't O
quite O
match O
up O
. O

The O
fillings B-AS
may O
be O
unconventional O
but O
the O
dosa B-AS
batter I-AS
is O
definitely O
authentic O
and O
the O
combinations O
very O
tasty O
. O

This O
is O
the O
perfect O
spot B-AS
for O
meeting O
friends O
, O
having O
lunch B-AS
, O
dinner B-AS
, O
pre B-AS
- I-AS
theatre I-AS
or I-AS
after I-AS
- I-AS
theatre I-AS
drinks I-AS
! O

This O
is O
a O
fun O
restaurant O
to O
go O
to O
. O

The O
mussaman B-AS
curry I-AS
that O
I O
ordered O
was O
as O
thin O
as O
water O
and O
aside O
from O
the O
poorly O
fried B-AS
tofu I-AS
that O
I O
ordered O
in O
it O
, O
they O
graciously O
provided O
me O
with O
ONE O
piece O
of O
poorly O
cooked O
potato B-AS
. O

Had O
a O
late O
night O
dinner B-AS
on O
a O
Saturday O
night O
. O

A O
restaurant O
that O
does O
n't O
try O
to O
do O
anything O
except O
serve O
great O
food B-AS
with O
great O
service B-AS
in O
a O
pleasant O
atmosphere B-AS
. O

Their O
sake B-AS
martini I-AS
is O
wonderful O
. O

Well O
, O
this O
place B-AS
is O
so O
Ghetto O
its O
not O
even O
funny O
. O

Bravissimo O
! O
! O

Once O
they O
ran O
out O
of O
Gnochi B-AS
and O
made O
it O
for O
me O
from O
scratch O
! O

We O
would O
like O
to O
thank O
Marcelo O
and O
Grace O
for O
a O
wonderful O
dining B-AS
experience O
! O
! O
! O

Found O
service B-AS
above O
average O
, O
but O
that O
could O
be O
because O
we O
were O
13 O
of O
us O
. O

When O
I O
arrived O
at O
Orsay O
I O
was O
thrown O
back O
, O
in O
a O
veyr O
good O
sense O
. O

Bagels B-AS
are O
ok O
, O
but O
be O
sure O
not O
to O
make O
any O
special O
requests O
! O

This O
is O
the O
Cheers O
of O
New O
York O
, O
whether O
you O
' O
ve O
ever O
been O
there O
or O
not O
. O

It O
's O
to O
die O
for O

Cute O
and O
decorative O
. O

I O
know O
this O
is O
the O
case O
in O
many O
nyc O
eateries O
, O
but O
here O
, O
they O
really O
cram O
you O
in O
to O
the O
point O
where O
it O
's O
borderline O
uncomfortable O
. O

fine O
dining O
restaurant O
quality B-AS
. O

Overall O
a O
disappointing O
experience O
for O
that O
price B-AS
category O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
had O
the O
lunch B-AS
buffet I-AS
at O
Chennai O
a O
couple O
of O
times O
, O
when O
I O
have O
been O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
exceptional O
. O

You O
will O
be O
satisfied O
. O

Another O
great O
place O
to O
take O
out O
- O
of O
- O
towners O
! O

But O
, O
hey O
, O
there O
is O
anything O
better O
with O
a O
decent O
vegetarian O
selection O
in O
Astoria O
. O

We O
were O
less O
than O
impressed O
. O

A O
Thai O
restaurant O
out O
of O
rice B-AS
during O
dinner B-AS
? O

but O
still O
my O
date O
was O
bad O

Would O
definitely O
go O
back O
again O
. O

I O
have O
been O
to O
Rao O
's O
probably O
15 O
times O
the O
past O
3 O
years O
and O
it O
keeps O
getting O
better O
. O

The O
portions B-AS
are O
small O
but O
being O
that O
the O
food B-AS
was O
so O
good O
makes O
up O
for O
that O
. O

and O
I O
have O
eaten O
my O
share O
Which O
impresses O
me O
for O
having O
such O
a O
large O
amount O
of O
people O
to O
serve B-AS
. O

Sure O
, O
the O
setting B-AS
is O
nice O
. O

Overall O
a O
worthwhile O
experience O
. O

The O
service B-AS
is O
friendly O
, O
if O
not O
the O
most O
prompt O
in O
the O
world O
, O
the O
food B-AS
is O
great O
, O
and O
the O
prices O
, O
while O
not O
cheap O
, O
wo O
n't O
put O
your O
wallet O
out O
of O
commission O
. O

Had O
1 O
appetizer B-AS
, O
2 O
entrees B-AS
and O
2 O
cokes B-AS
and O
the O
bill B-AS
was O
~ O
$ O
5500 O
, O
not O
including O
tip O
. O

It O
's O
really O
a O
takeaway O
place O
, O
I O
would O
n't O
sit O
if O
I O
could O
take O
it O
home O
. O

THE O
MOST O
FUN O
RESTAURANT O
I O
HAVE O
EVER O
BEEN O
TOO O
! O

Best O
drumsticks B-AS
over I-AS
rice I-AS
and O
sour B-AS
spicy I-AS
soup I-AS
in O
town O
! O

Some O
of O
the O
finest O
latin O
women O
you O
'll O
see O
in O
your O
life O
hang O
out O
at O
Jimmy O
's O
. O

Slightly O
above O
average O
wines B-AS
start O
at O
$ O
70 O
+ O
with O
only O
one O
selection O
listed O
at O
$ O
30 O
+ O
. O

Their O
whitefish B-AS
salad I-AS
is O
excellent O
-- O
all O
whitefish B-AS
with O
a O
little O
mayo B-AS
. O

And O
it O
all O
comes O
at O
a O
very O
reasonable O
price B-AS
congee I-AS
, O
noodles B-AS
, O
and O
rice B-AS
dishes I-AS
are O
no O
more O
than O
$ O
3 O
- O
6 O
each O
. O

Nobody O
at O
this O
restaurant O
will O
give O
firm O
answers O
about O
anything O
and O
in O
the O
end O
, O
not O
one O
person O
takes O
responsibility O
for O
anything O
. O

I O
had O
a O
great O
experience O
. O

The O
chicken B-AS
parm O
was O
edible O
but O
had O
canned O
tomato B-AS
sauce I-AS
and O
boxed O
pasta B-AS
and O
the O
chicken B-AS
with I-AS
portobello I-AS
mushrooms I-AS
consisted O
of O
dry O
, O
inedible O
chicken B-AS
with O
terrible O
sauce B-AS
. O

I O
recommend O
this O
place O
to O
everyone O
who O
asks O
me O
where O
to O
go O
for O
a O
good O
meal B-AS
. O

The O
waitresses B-AS
are O
nice O
-- O
also O
you O
can O
just O
get O
counter B-AS
service I-AS
sit O
. O

The O
only O
friendly O
staff B-AS
member I-AS
was O
the O
guy B-AS
at O
the O
bar B-AS
. O

Having O
been O
a O
long O
time O
Ess O
- O
a O
- O
Bagel O
fan O
, O
I O
was O
surpised O
to O
find O
myself O
return O
time O
and O
time O
again O
to O
Murray O
's O
. O

Go O
for O
it O
! O

Highly O
recommended O
. O

You O
can O
certainly O
find O
restaurants O
that O
offer O
a O
superior O
fine O
dining O
experience O
, O
but O
for O
superb O
food B-AS
at O
reasonable O
prices B-AS
, O
La O
Villa O
ca O
n't O
be O
beat O
. O

Wo O
n't O
or O
Ca O
n't O
is O
not O
in O
the O
service B-AS
directory O
. O

I O
can O
not O
imagine O
a O
friendlier O
staff B-AS
working O
in O
a O
restaurant O
. O

I O
do O
suggest O
to O
ask O
to O
be O
seated O
upstairs B-AS
if O
you O
are O
looking O
to O
be O
a O
little O
cozy O
. O

To O
speak O
of O
the O
Park O
Side O
, O
words O
can O
not O
describe O
. O

The O
red B-AS
curry I-AS
is O
weak O
and O
tasteless O
, O
the O
pad B-AS
thai I-AS
is O
stuck O
together O
and O
lumpy O
, O
the O
rice B-AS
is O
often O
overcooked O
, O
and O
the O
seafood B-AS
is O
pretty O
sketchy O
. O

The O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
is O
extensive O
and O
can O
easily O
hike O
up O
an O
otherwise O
reasonably O
priced B-AS
meal I-AS
. O

Saul B-AS
is O
pretty O
good O
, O
but O
definitely O
not O
great O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
Roxy O
's O
for O
that O
, O
but O
not O
for O
their O
food B-AS
. O

We O
always O
get O
a O
sampling O
of O
appetizers B-AS
and O
share O
. O

Overall O
I O
was O
impressed O
and O
will O
return O
, O
it O
's O
a O
great O
QPR O
Quality B-AS
to O
Price B-AS
Ratio O
. O

It O
is O
nearly O
impossible O
to O
get O
a O
table B-AS
, O
so O
if O
you O
ever O
have O
the O
chance O
to O
go O
here O
for O
dinner B-AS
, O
DO O
NOT O
pass O
it O
up O
. O

Their O
pad B-AS
penang I-AS
is O
delicious O
and O
everything O
else O
is O
fantastic O
. O

The O
puke O
green O
walls B-AS
leave O
a O
lot O
to O
be O
desired O
, O
but O
the O
food B-AS
is O
very O
good O
. O

The O
flavors B-AS
are O
very O
fresh O
and O
pretty O
inobtrusive O
, O
nothing O
flashy O
. O

I O
like O
Cafe O
Noir O
do O
n't O
get O
me O
wrong O
, O
it O
is O
jsut O
that O
the O
people B-AS
who O
work O
there O
are O
evil O
and O
incompetent O
! O
! O

The O
hanger B-AS
steak I-AS
was O
like O
rubber O
and O
the O
tuna B-AS
was O
flavorless O
not O
to O
mention O
it O
tasted O
like O
it O
had O
just O
been O
thawed O
. O

But O
$ O
1 O
for O
each O
small O
piece O
? O
? O
? O

Our O
son O
loves O
pizza B-AS
and O
we O
have O
a O
certified O
Neapolitan O
pizza B-AS
in O
our O
home O
city O
Seattle O
, O
we O
liked O
this O
nearly O
as O
much O
, O
and O
the O
differences O
were O
more O
about O
personal O
preference O
than O
any O
reflection O
on O
either O
restaurant O
. O

big O
and O
soft O
as O
well O
as O
good O
lunch B-AS
food I-AS
. O

No O
food B-AS
snobs O
allowed O
, O
this O
place O
is O
for O
people O
who O
appreciate O
good O
food B-AS
. O

I O
liked O
the O
food B-AS
at O
this O
quasi B-AS
- I-AS
thai I-AS
restaurant O
. O

By O
far O
the O
best O
salad B-AS
I O
have O
had O
in O
a O
fast B-AS
food I-AS
restaurant O
. O

Suan O
is O
a O
great O
place O
that O
I O
often O
take O
my O
friends O
classmates O
too O
. O

Not O
a O
great O
place O
for O
family O
or O
general O
dining O
. O

As O
for O
the O
bar B-AS
, O
this O
is O
another O
bad O
idea O
. O

Their O
bagel B-AS
are O
fine O
, O
but O
they O
are O
a O
little O
overcooked O
, O
and O
not O
really O
a O
special O
bagel B-AS
experience O
. O

Unlike O
HH O
up O
the O
block O
, O
this O
place O
actually O
gives O
you O
hearty O
and O
hot O
bagels B-AS
this O
town O
is O
known O
for O
. O

I O
thought O
going O
to O
Jimmys O
would O
give O
me O
a O
real O
Domincan O
exprience O
. O

The O
barebecued B-AS
salmon I-AS
is O
elegantly O
spiced O
and O
not O
at O
all O
dry O
. O

Same O
owner B-AS
as O
the O
guy O
who O
owns O
Typhoon O
, O
which O
is O
just O
down O
the O
street O
on O
St O
Marks O
and O
1st O
Ave O
. O

What O
generous O
portions B-AS
! O

The O
workers B-AS
there O
also O
absolutely O
load O
the O
bagel B-AS
with O
cream B-AS
cheese I-AS
gets O
a O
little O
messy O
. O

I O
was O
wrong O
. O

The O
wine B-AS
the O
service B-AS
was O
very O
good O
too O
. O

So O
, O
the O
menu B-AS
is O
written O
in O
chalk O
above O
your O
head O
and O
it O
all O
sounds O
delicious O
. O

The O
highly O
spiced O
chai B-AS
tea I-AS
was O
great O
too O
. O

No O
plans O
to O
return O
anytime O
soon O
. O

I O
have O
been O
there O
many O
times O
, O
and O
food B-AS
is O
good O
and O
consistent O
. O

Seriously O
, O
this O
is O
the O
best O
all O
you O
can O
eat O
in O
town O
As O
everyone O
says O
, O
the O
Spicy B-AS
Tuna I-AS
hand I-AS
rolls I-AS
are O
the O
best O
have O
4 O
of O
these O
, O
and O
you O
' O
ve O
broken O
even O
. O

There O
is O
not O
a O
single O
place O
in O
Chinatown O
where O
you O
have O
a O
nice O
neighborhood O
feeling O
like O
here O
. O

While O
Sapphire O
is O
certainly O
not O
lacking O
in O
ambiance B-AS
, O
and O
probably O
has O
the O
best O
decor B-AS
of O
any O
Indian O
restaurant O
I O
have O
been O
to O
in O
New O
York O
City O
, O
the O
food B-AS
was O
not O
what O
I O
had O
hoped O
for O
. O

I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
this O
place O
to O
anyone O
looking O
for O
a O
casual O
atmosphere B-AS
that O
whisks O
you O
away O
to O
the O
left O
bank O
of O
the O
river O
Seine O
. O

I O
just O
do O
not O
understand O
what O
the O
fuss O
is O
all O
about O
. O

The O
meat B-AS
dishes I-AS
were O
only O
so O
- O
so O
. O

His O
wife O
Tanya O
, O
the O
hostess B-AS
, O
completes O
the O
comforting O
atmosphere B-AS
by O
being O
delightfully O
warm O
and O
gracious O
. O

We O
liked O
it O
so O
much O
, O
that O
we O
will O
always O
make O
it O
a O
point O
to O
dine O
here O
when O
we O
visit O
New O
York O
. O

The O
menu B-AS
consisted O
of O
standard O
brassiere B-AS
food I-AS
, O
better O
then O
places O
like O
Balthazar O
etc O
. O

I O
have O
been O
a O
longtime O
fan O
of O
Holy O
Basil O
in O
the O
East O
Village O
, O
and O
while O
I O
do O
believe O
their O
food B-AS
has O
slightly O
slipped O
in O
quality B-AS
, O
I O
have O
been O
hesitant O
to O
be O
disloyal O
. O

But O
the O
best O
part O
about O
LS O
is O
the O
late O
night O
atmosphere B-AS
, O
delightfully O
free O
of O
the O
BTs O
. O

For O
an O
untrendy O
rip O
- O
off O
eat O
here O
. O

And O
you O
're O
hungry O
a O
few O
hours O
later O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
wait O
to O
go O
back O
. O

I O
HATE O
HATE O
HATE O
this O
place O
. O

We O
even O
had O
a O
visit O
from O
the O
Manager B-AS
who O
wanted O
to O
make O
sure O
we O
were O
enjoying O
ourselves O
. O

The O
staff B-AS
there O
is O
very O
attentive O
and O
down O
to O
earth O
. O

You O
do O
n't O
go O
to O
Mizu O
for O
excellent O
service B-AS
, O
you O
go O
for O
the O
large O
amounts O
of O
food B-AS
, O
the O
amiable O
atmosphere B-AS
, O
and O
the O
hole O
- O
in O
- O
the O
- O
wall O
feeling O
of O
the O
place O
. O

The O
service B-AS
is O
always O
bad O
though O
, O
do O
n't O
expect O
much O
of O
anything O
from O
your O
server B-AS
, O
and O
I O
would O
not O
recommend O
bringing O
a O
date O
here O
either O
. O

Monday O
nights O
are O
a O
bargain O

Wonderful O
! O

It O
took O
them O
15 O
minutes O
to O
put O
water B-AS
in O
our O
glasses O
. O

The O
service B-AS
is O
descent O
even O
when O
this O
small O
place B-AS
is O
packed O
. O

This O
is O
the O
best O

Go O

I O
have O
eaten O
a O

This O

Great O

The O

thoroughly O
unremarkable O

also O
great O

a O
delicate B-AS
butternut I-AS

and I-AS

to O
a O

that O
I O
ca O

remember O
because O
of O
the O
fabulous O
Cakebread B-AS
Cabernet I-AS
we O
were O
drinking O
- O
the O
whole O
evening O
was O
amazing O
. O

Truly O
the O
mark O
of O
an O
attentive O
waiter B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
here O
is O
rather O
good O
, O
but O
only O
if O
you O
like O
to O
wait O
for O
it O
. O

I O
got O
an O
excellent O
piece O
of O
cheesecake B-AS
and O
we O
had O
several O
other O
nice O
pastries B-AS
. O

The O
staff B-AS
is O
very O
kind O
and O
well O
trained O
, O
they O
're O
fast O
, O
they O
are O
always O
prompt O
to O
jump O
behind O
the O
bar B-AS
and O
fix O
drinks B-AS
, O
they O
know O
details O
of O
every O
item O
in O
the O
menu B-AS
and O
make O
excelent O
recomendations O
. O

The O
makhani B-AS
was O
OK O
-- O
the O
korma B-AS
was O
bland O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
inventive O
but O
still O
keeps O
traditional O
indian O
flavoring O
. O

All O
I O
can O
say O
is O
WOW O
! O

though O
the O
service O
could O
be O
better O
possibly O
due O
to O
more O
than O
one O
very O
large O
group O
in O
the O
house O
, O
it O
is O
very O
cordial O
and O
warm O
, O
as O
is O
the O
general O
clientele O
. O

The O
decor B-AS
in O
this O
place B-AS
is O
very O
diner O
- O
ish O
and O
the O
kind O
of O
place B-AS
you O
expect O
in O
the O
East O
Village O
, O
not O
romantic O
, O
just O
simple O
, O
small O
and O
sparse O
. O

This O
is O
a O
cute O
place B-AS
and O
could O
be O
good O
but O
they O
need O
to O
get O
their O
act O
together O
. O

The O
lox B-AS
is O
always O
fresh O
too O
. O

Sure O
enough O
, O
exactly O
30 O
minutes O
later O
we O
got O
the O
call O
and O
were O
seated O
promptly O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
very O
friendly O
. O

So O
all O
I O
' O
m O
trying O
to O
say O
is O
this O
restaurant O
is O
by O
far O
the O
best O
thai B-AS
food I-AS
restaurant O
I O
' O
ve O
ever O
been O
to O
. O

Food B-AS
was O
OK O
, O
fish B-AS
was O
cooked O
well O
. O

We O
actually O
left O
hungry O
and O
went O
across O
the O
street O
to O
Wo O
Hop O
at O
15 O
Mott O
street O
for O
some O
good O
chinese B-AS
food I-AS
. O

The O
duck B-AS
confit I-AS
is O
always O
amazing O
and O
the O
foie B-AS
gras I-AS
terrine I-AS
with I-AS
figs I-AS
was O
out O
of O
this O
world O
. O

The O
whole O
set O
up O
is O
truly O
unprofessional O
and O
I O
wish O
Cafe O
Noir O
would O
get O
some O
good O
staff B-AS
, O
because O
despite O
the O
current O
one O
this O
is O
a O
great O
place O
. O

The O
service O
does O
sometimes O
lack O
focus O
and O
it O
is O
not O
ideal O
if O
you O
are O
in O
a O
hurry O
but O
I O
have O
never O
been O
treated O
rudely O
. O

The O
staff B-AS
offers O
impeccable O
service B-AS
. O

The O
catch O
is O
that O
you O
are O
charged O
extra O
for O
ANYTHING O
that O
you O
leave O
on O
your O
plate O
so O
do O
n't O
be O
a O
greedy O
pig O
! O

We O
ended O
our O
great O
experience O

having O
Gulab B-AS
Jamun I-AS
( I-AS

) I-AS
recommended O
by O
the O
waiter B-AS
. O

wo O

come O
back O
again O
for O
sure O
! O

i O
went O
to O
utsav O
about O
a O
yr O
ago O
with O
my O
family O
. O

This O
place O
does O
n't O
compare O
with O
Mamoun O
's O
in O
terms O
of O
price B-AS
, O
freshness B-AS
, O
value B-AS
, O
and O
consisent O
quality B-AS
, O
but O
that O
's O
just O
my O
opinion O
. O

The O
place B-AS
is O
sleek O
, O
modern O
and O
playfull O
and O
i O
will O
return O
again O
frequently O
. O

I O
have O
known O
about O
this O
secret O
for O
the O
last O
13 O
years O
, O
Emiliothe O
Godfather O
has O
continued O
to O
serve O
food B-AS
and O
wine B-AS
for O
the O
gods O
at O
mortal O
prices B-AS
. O

The O
brioche B-AS
and I-AS
lollies I-AS
as O
party O
favors O
is O
a O
cute O
and O
sweet O
touch O
to O
a O
most O
memorable O
meal B-AS
. O

After O
being O
told O
that O
our O
party O
of O
three O
would O
be O
seated O
in O
10 O
minutes O
and O
watching O
other O
parties O
multiples O
of O
2 O
and O
higher O
seated O
for O
40 O
minutes O
, O
the O
three O
of O
us O
were O
squished O
into O
a O
small O
2-person B-AS
table I-AS
. O

And O
the O
bill B-AS
was O
outragous O
. O

The O
service O
was O
attentive O
, O
yet O
unimposing O
, O
the O
food B-AS
was O
far O
better O
than O
many O
notorious O
restaurants O
in O
Midtown O
and O
the O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
is O
extensive O
and O
well O
priced B-AS

Kind O

Salads B-AS
were O
fantastic O

The O
owners B-AS
and O
employees B-AS
are O
friendly O
and O
their O
pizza B-AS
is O
fantastic O
. O

La O
Rosa O
waltzes O
in O
, O
and O
I O
think O
they O
are O
doing O
it O
the O
best O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
yummy O
, O
especially O
their O
cooked O
- O
to O
- O
perfection O
mussels B-AS
in I-AS
spicy I-AS
tomato I-AS
sauce I-AS
and O
their O
shoestring O
crispy O
fries B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
authentic O
Italian O
, O
delicious O
! O

A O
great O
addition O
to O
Smith O
Street O
, O
finally O
, O
a O
place O
that O
's O
not O
pretentious O
and O
filled O
with O
women O
wearing O
Ugg O
boots O
. O

skip O

We O
spent O
$ O
200 O
in O
this O
place O
and O
left O
hungry O
and O
very O
disappointed O
. O

It O
is O
simply O
amazing O
. O

I O
complete O
the O
total O
bagel B-AS
experience O
by O
having O
it O
lightly O
toasted O
. O

It O
was O
like O
the O
servers B-AS
forgot O
that O
they O
actually O
worked O
there O
and O
instead O
wanted O
to O
hang O
out O
and O
be O
cool O
. O

I O
liked O
this O
place O
the O
first O
time O
but O
doubt O
I O
will O
ever O
return O
. O

The O
service B-AS
is O
good O
and O
ambience B-AS
is O
good O
for O
a O
date O
or O
group O
outing O
. O

A O
great O
way O
to O
make O
some O
money O
is O
to O
buy O
a O
case B-AS
of I-AS
snapple I-AS
from O
Costco O
and O
sell O
it O
right O
outside O
for O
only O
$ O
250 O

all O
about O
the O
food B-AS

Fast O

Skip O
this O

The O
service B-AS

We O
a O
menu O

the O

care B-AS
they O
put O
in O
thier O
food B-AS
in O
evident O
. O

ALWAYS O
full O
with O
tourists O
especially O
because O
of O
it O
's O
close O
proximity O
to O
Rockefeller O
Center O
. O

The O
decor O
is O
nice O
, O
but O
more O
casual O
than O
fine O
dining O
. O

This O
restaurant O
is O
a O
wonderful O
place O
to O
go O
many O
times O
and O
it O
is O
reasonably O
priced B-AS
. O

Bravo O

My O

came O
across O
this O
place O
while O
walking O
in O
the O
village O
. O

Bottom O
line O
, O
B+ O
for O
the O
food B-AS
, O
F O
for O
the O
service B-AS

The O
only O
thing O
the O
waiters B-AS
do O
n't O
do O
for O
you O
is O
wipe O
your O
chin O
when O
you O
leave O

This O
place O
is O
to O
be O
avoided O
. O

Stick O
to O
dimsum B-AS
, O
not O
super O
overpriced O
noodles B-AS

The O
service B-AS

and O
they O
allow O
you O
to O

My O
sister O
says O
it O
reminds O
her O
of O
a O
restaurant O
run O
by O
high O
- O
school O
students O
who O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
they O
are O
doing O
. O

We O
, O
there O
were O
four O
of O
us O
, O
arrived O
at O
noon O
, O
the O
place O
was O
empty O
, O
and O
the O
staff B-AS
acted O
like O
we O
were O
imposing O
on O
them O
and O
they O
were O
very O
rude O
. O

At O
6 O
, O
30 O
, O
we O
were O
the O
third O
party O
there O
. O

delicious O
simple O
food B-AS
in O
nice O
outdoor O
atmosphere B-AS
. O

I O
will O
definetly O
be O
going O
back O
. O

No O
, O
really O
. O

The O
food O
is O
good O
, O
but O
very O
expensive O
for O
the O
casualness O
of O
it O
. O

The O
only O
fallback O
on O
this O
restaurant O
is O
the O
prices B-AS
. O

I O
' O
ve O
been O
to O
Naples O
45 O
for O
dinner B-AS
twice O
. O

The O
hot O
and O
sour O
soup B-AS
was O
unbearably O
hot O
and O
tasted O
of O
only O
pepper B-AS
and O
nothing O
else O
. O

i O
love O
the O
pics O
of O
andy O
warhol O
when O
he O
used O
to O
frequent O
the O
place O
he O
painted O
the O
ballato O

Try O
sushimi B-AS
cucumber I-AS
roll I-AS
. O

I O
' O
m O
saving O
up O
for O
my O
next O
visit O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
delicious O
. O

Their O
wines B-AS
by I-AS
the I-AS
glass I-AS
are O
a O
great O
accompaniment O
and O
you O
can O
eat O
like O
a O
king O
with O
wine B-AS
for O
under O
$ O
30 O
. O

This O
place B-AS
has O
the O
the O
correct O
ambience B-AS
and O
an O
excellent O
staff B-AS
to O
make O
you O
feel O
like O
a O
guest O
and O
a O
friend O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

Amma O
is O
nothing O
special O
. O

Yeah O
Shanghai O
is O
also O
great O
but O
not O
quite O
as O
good O
- O
they O
use O
the O
same O
amount O
of O
salt B-AS
but O
without O
sweetness O
to O
balance O
out O
. O

believe O
us O
, O
we O
' O
ve O
been O
eating O
sushi B-AS
for O
over O
15 O
yrs O
. O

Worth O
it O
for O
a O
special O
occasion O
, O
or O
any O
time O
! O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
much O
better O
than O
Sripraphai O
more O
modern O
and O
sleek O
. O

I O
recommend O
to O
anyone O
who O
wants O
to O
dress O
up O
and O
impress O
the O
lady O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
outstanding O
and O
the O
service B-AS
is O
quick O
, O
friendly O
and O
very O
professional O
. O

The O
bagels B-AS
always O
warm O
, O
soft O
on O
the O
inside O
, O
crispy O
on O
the O
outside O
and O
enormous O
in O
size O
. O

I O
had O
a O
late O
dinner B-AS
at O
Lucky O
Stike O
, O
a O
great O
name O
for O
a O
joint O
if O
ever O
I O
saw O
one O
. O

Been O
there O
, O
done O
that O
, O
and O
New O
York O
, O
it O
's O
not O
that O
big O
a O
deal O
. O

Definitely O
a O
once O
a O
year O
treat O
that O
I O
look O
forward O
to O
around O
the O
holidays O
! O

Service B-AS
is O
fast O
and O
friendly O
. O

from O
an O
English O
speaking O
staff B-AS
. O

Anyhow O
, O
we O
were O
able O
to O
sit O
as O
long O
as O
we O
wanted O
and O
chat O
, O
which O
was O
nice O
. O

And O
they O
have O
these O
home O
made O
potato B-AS
chips I-AS
at O
the O
bar B-AS
that O
are O
the O
most O
delicious O
things O
in O
the O
world O
! O

A O
defitely O
must O
visit O
. O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
enjoyed O
each O
of O
the O
6 O
taste O
size O
portions B-AS
and O
left O
completely O
full O
. O

I O
went O
here O
with O
a O
friend O
on O
a O
whim O
, O
we O
went O
someplace O
else O
first O
and O
could O
n't O
get O
a O
table B-AS
. O

We O
all O
ate O
pasta B-AS
entre'es I-AS
, O
which O
were O
great O
. O

My O
friends O
and O
I O
showed O
up O
on O
a O
Sat O
. O

The O
steak B-AS
was O
excellent O
and O
one O
of O
the O
best O
I O
have O
had O
I O
tasted O
the O
butter B-AS
intitally O
but O
in O
no O
way O
did O
it O
overwhelm O
the O
flavor B-AS
of O
the O
meat B-AS
. O

great O
experience O
overall O
. O

PERFECT O
FOR O
DATES O
! O

The O
food B-AS
was O
boring O
and O
expensive O
. O

The O
ambience B-AS
is O
pretty O
and O
nice O
for O
conversation O
, O
so O
a O
casual O
lunch B-AS
here O
would O
probably O
be O
best O
. O

Terrific O
menu B-AS
full O
of O
unique O
rolls B-AS
and O
special O
dishes B-AS
. O

The O
service B-AS
is O
ok O
but O
could O
be O
better O
. O

We O
love O
the O
food B-AS
, O
drinks B-AS
, O
and O
atmosphere B-AS
! O

I O
was O
here O
a O
few O
weeks O
back O
and O
we O
had O
the O
worst O
customer B-AS
service I-AS
experience O
at O
a O
restaurant O
ever O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
ordered O
from O
the O
2nd O
ave O
. O

Nothing O
against O
a O
good O
sales O
call O
, O
but O
the O
tactics O
at O
Amma O
are O
just O
too O
obvious O
. O

Went O
on O
a O
3 O
day O
oyster B-AS
binge O
, O
with O
Fish B-AS
bringing O
up O
the O
closing O
, O
and O
I O
am O
so O
glad O
this O
was O
the O
place B-AS
it O
O O
trip O
ended O
, O
because O
it O
was O
so O
great O
! O

Took O
my O
mom O
for O
Mother O
's O
Day O
, O
and O
the O
maitre B-AS
d I-AS
' I-AS
was O
pretty O
rude O
. O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
have O
been O
there O
a O
couple O
of O
times O
and O
each O
time O
we O
sat O
at O
the O
sushi B-AS
bar I-AS
chef I-AS
Yoshi O
and O
ordered O
everything O
ala B-AS
carte I-AS
. O

The O
vibe B-AS
is O
very O
relaxed O
and O
cozy O
, O
service B-AS
was O
great O
and O
the O
food B-AS
was O
excellent O
! O

If O
the O
weather O
is O
nice O
, O
try O
to O
snag O
an O
outside O
table B-AS
. O

If O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
good O
quality B-AS
, O
cheap O
eats O
, O
this O
is O
the O
place O
. O

However O
, O
for O
what O
we O
spent O
, O
overall O
, O
it O
just O
was O
not O
up O
to O
par O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
friendly O
and O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
was O
casual O
. O

A O
friend O
from O
Seattle O
and O
I O
went O
on O
a O
Thursday O
night O
around O
8 O
, O
30 O
. O

When O
I O
lived O
upstate O
for O
a O
while O
I O
would O
buy O
freeze O
the O
bagels B-AS
and O
they O
would O
still O
be O
better O
than O
any O
else O
. O

I O
recommend O
their O
Pad B-AS
See I-AS
Ew I-AS
, O
Pork B-AS
Chops I-AS
or O
Tofu B-AS
plates I-AS
. O

Never O
in O
my O
life O
did O
I O
think O
that O
I O
could O
be O
satisfied O
both O
in O
taste B-AS
and O
in O
quantity B-AS
for O
$ O
300 O
in O
NYC O
. O

this O
is O
the O
best O
secret O
place O
in O
midtown O
' O
, O
I O
heard O
that O
from O
the O
bartender B-AS
, O
after O
having O
brilliant O
food B-AS
try O
steak B-AS
with I-AS
portobello I-AS
mushrooms I-AS
and O
drinks B-AS
on O
the O
bar B-AS
last O
Tuesday O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
excellent O
, O
friendly O
and O
attentive O
. O

The O
main B-AS
course I-AS
had O
an O
average O
portion B-AS
, O
and O
was O
decent O
overall O
. O

20 O
minutes O
for O
our O
reservation B-AS
but O
it O
gave O
us O
time O
to O
have O
a O
few O
cocktails B-AS
and O
enjoy O
our O
surroundings B-AS
and O
each O
other O
. O

Just O
remember O
, O
the O
later O
you O
go O
, O
the O
longer O
you O
may O
have O
to O
wait O
. O

Waitstaff B-AS
is O
great O
, O
very O
attentive O
. O

I O
live O
in O
the O
neightborhood O
and O
am O
a O
regular O
. O

The O
dinner B-AS
menu I-AS
is O
diverse O
and O
top O
- O
notch O
as O
well O
. O

IT O
IS O
WHAT O
MODERN O
CUISINE B-AS
IS O
ALL O
ABOUT O
. O

In O
any O
event O
, O
even O
though O
its O
a O
bit O
on O
the O
pricey O
side O
, O
we O
still O
love O
this O
restaurant O
and O
will O
definitely O
go O
back O
. O

I O
definitely O
will O
go O
back O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
like O
Indian B-AS
food I-AS
too O
much O
and O
this O
was O
delicious O
, O
however O
you O
want O
to O
factor O
that O
into O
the O
equation O
. O

at O
taj O
, O
vegetarians O
can O
rejoice O
- O
all O
the O
dishes B-AS
are O
manna O
from O
heaven O
. O

Forget O
the O
rush O
and O
the O
wait O
and O
the O
noise O
which O
is O
n't O
actually O
that O
bad O
, O
I O
mean O
please O
, O
who O
goes O
to O
a O
steakhouse O
to O
be O
coddled O
and O
romantic O
? O

Having O
hunted O
around O
for O
a O
quiet O
, O
romantic O
, O
yet O
not O
hideously O
expensive O
restaurant O
I O
stumbled O
across O
reviews O
for O
La O
Lanterna O
and O
gave O
it O
a O
shot O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
never O
been O
disappointed O
. O

I O
wo O
n't O
go O
back O
unless O
someone O
else O
is O

buy O
bagels B-AS
to O
eat O
hot O
and O
then O
to O
freeze O
they O
told O
me O
that O
if O
I O
call O
in O
the O
order O
, O
they O
'd O
bring O
it O
out O
to O
the O
car O
so O
I O
would O
n't O
have O
to O
look O
for O
parking O
. O

From O
the O
street O
it O
looks O
very O
hidden O
, O
and O
is O
actually O
an O
old O
warehouse O
. O

Jimmy O
's O
is O
hands O
down O
the O
hottest O
night O
spot B-AS
in O
the O
Bronx O
. O

And O
I O
would O
have O
to O
agree O
with O
the O
masses O
in O
terms O
of O
service B-AS
, O
delivery B-AS
is O
their O
Achilles O
heel O
. O

My O
boyfriend O
and O
I O
have O
been O
to O
The O
Minnow O
four O
times O
now O
and O
we O
have O
consistently O
been O
impressed O
. O

The O
$ O
300 O
bill B-AS
was O
a O
bit O
steep O
, O
but O
the O
experience O
was O
great O
. O

I O
would O
n't O
mind O
going O
back O
some O
time O
, O
but O
not O
before O
trying O
others O
nearby O
. O

Nice O
ambiance B-AS
, O
nice O
little O
bar B-AS
, O
good O
bar B-AS
, O
Francois O
, O
and O
good O
service B-AS
. O

I O
found O
this O
restaurant O
to O
be O
one O
that O
truly O
values O
its O
patrons O
. O

The O
calamari B-AS
comes O
with O
an O
incredible O
sauce B-AS
, O
and O
the O
duck B-AS
noodles I-AS
are O
yummy O
as O
well O
. O

I O
would O
definitely O
go O
back O
- O
if O
only O
for O
some O
of O
those O
exotic O
martinis B-AS
on O
the O
blackboard O
. O

For O
some O
reason O
the O
place O
was O
empty O
when O
we O
got O
in O
and O
remained O
so O
for O
the O
entire O
evening O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
understand O
why O
but O
we O
had O
a O
blast O
and O
will O
definately O
go O
back O
the O
next O
time O
we O
are O
in O
the O
area O
. O

Simple O
comfort B-AS
food I-AS
and O
what O
hot O
and O
lage O
portions B-AS
. O

But O
I O
just O
would O
like O
to O
say O
I O
read O
the O
reviews O
people O
left O
and O
that O
s O
why O
I O
checked O
it O
out O
. O

Stay O
away O
from O
the O
two O
specialty O
rolls B-AS
on O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
though O
too O
much O
avocado B-AS
and O
rice B-AS
will O
fill O
you O
up O
right O
quick O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
eaten O
at O
Pizza O
Gruppo O
a O
few O
times O
, O
but O
more O
often O
I O
order O
delivery O
. O

We O
did O
n't O
get O
drink B-AS
refills I-AS
and O
she O
did O
n't O
even O
offer O
us O
the O
option O
of O
dessert B-AS
. O

Beautiful O
experience O
. O

The O
bagels B-AS
are O
also O
reasonably O
priced B-AS
for O
NYC O
. O

If O
you O
can O
handle O
that O
, O
it O
's O
a O
great O
place O
for O
a O
business B-AS
dinner I-AS
, O
fun O
with O
friends O
or O
simply O
a O
table B-AS
for O
2 O
. O

Decor B-AS
leaves O
something O
to O
be O
desired O
. O

Jimmy O
is O
Dominican O
! O

Also O
, O
specify O
if O
you O
like O
your O
food B-AS
spicy O
its O
rather O
bland O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
. O

Our O
waiter B-AS
was O
fine O
, O
the O
place B-AS
looks O
nice O
in O
that O
not O
- O
trying O
- O
too O
- O
hard O
way O
, O
but O
at O
those O
prices B-AS
, O
a O
little O
more O
should O
be O
expected O
of O
your O
food B-AS
. O

Coming O
from O
Boston O
this O
place O
is O
like O
Emma O
's O
Pizza O
in O
Kendall O
Square O
in O
Cambridge O
although O
they O
have O
more O
funky O
toppings B-AS
! O

When O
my O
husband O
and O
go O
there O
, O
we O
spend O
$ O
6000 O
have O
LOBSTER B-AS
TAILS I-AS
UMMMMM O
need O
I O
say O
more O
I O
ca O
n't O
say O
any O
more O
, O
it O
a O
place B-AS
you O
'll O
never O
forget O
If O
you O
never O
go O
, O
you O
'll O
miss O
A O
Meal B-AS
of O
your O
life O
time O
. O

in O
an O
effort O
to O
increase O
turnover O
, O
the O
restaurant O
offers O
no O
desserts B-AS
beyond O
the O
complimentary O
espresso B-AS
cup I-AS
filled I-AS
with I-AS
chocolate I-AS
mousse I-AS
. O

I O
' O
ve O
been O
to O
this O
restaurant O
more O
than O
a O
dozen O
times O
and O
when O
I O
' O
m O
craving O
for O
Pho B-AS
, O
Lemon B-AS
grass I-AS
chicken I-AS
or O
Beef B-AS
Cube I-AS
on I-AS
rice I-AS
, O
this O
is O
the O
place O
to O
go O
. O

Oh O
yes O
, O
and O
if O
you O
are O
a O
fan O
of O
Indian O
oldies O
film O
stars O
, O
there O
are O
plenty O
of O
portraits B-AS
of O
Indian O
actors O
and O
actresses O
in O
classic O
black O
white O
that O
adorn O
the O
walls O
, O
some O
of O
which O
, O
I O
would O
love O
to O
know O
where O
they O
obtained O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
spectacular O
, O
from O
the O
appitizers B-AS
to O
the O
main B-AS
course I-AS
, O
and O
then O
of O
course O
the O
desserts B-AS
, O
WOW O
you O
'll O
need O
no O
more O
. O

The O
neighborhood O
was O
nice O
though O
so O
check O
out O
another O
restaurant O
instead O
. O

My O
fish B-AS
was O
delicious O
in O
an O
incredible O
curry B-AS
sauce I-AS
. O

If O
you O
are O
in O
search O
of O
the O
most O
authentic O
NYC O
deli B-AS
experience O
look O
no O
further O
than O
the O
famous O
and O
historic O
Katz O
's O
Deli O
down O
on O
the O
Lower O
East O
Side O
. O

Even O
upon O
delivery O
, O
their O
juicy O
pork B-AS
buns I-AS
are O
quite O
good O
. O

This O
is O
also O
where O
I O
was O
from O
. O

Everything O
is O
for O
sale O
in O
here O
including O
the O
sculptured O
iron O
statue O
on O
the O
table O
. O

Average O
to O
good O
Thai B-AS
food I-AS
, O
but O
terrible O
delivery B-AS
. O

The O
space B-AS
is O
nice O
but O
when O
we O
order O
our O
drink B-AS
we O
were O
in O
for O
a O
surprise O
. O

The O
entire O
place B-AS
and O
the O
treatment O
we O
received O
felt O
as O
a O
conveyor O
belt O
. O

Joe O
's O
Pizza O
used O
to O
have O
the O
best O
slice B-AS
until O
this O
pizzeria O
opened O
up O
. O

I O
in O
all O
reality O
felt O
as O
if O
I O
had O
just O
gotten O
off O
Air O
France O
and O
was O
in O
the O
8th O
District O
in O
Paris O
. O

I O
have O
never O
had O
anything O
like O
it O
! O

Yeah O
the O
crowd O
can O
take O
it O
a O
bit O
seriously O
, O
but O
it O
should O
n't O
. O

And O
they O
provided O
a O
delicious O
dessert B-AS
on O
the O
house O
! O

They O
are O
still O
living O
in O
the O
dark O
ages O
and O
do O
not O
have O
an O
answering O
machine O
, O
so O
if O
you O
want O
to O
make O
a O
reservation B-AS
you O
are O
limited O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
amazing O
, O
rich O
pastas B-AS
and O
fresh O
doughy O
pizza B-AS
. O

Food B-AS
was O
very O
good O
, O
but O
not O
what O
I O
would O
consider O
out O
of O
this O
world O
. O

I O
had O
Lobster B-AS
Bisque I-AS
it O
has O
2 O
oz O
of O
Maine B-AS
Lobster I-AS
in O
it O
. O

I O
am O
Indian O
, O
and O
I O
have O
tried O
many O
Indian O
places O
in O
NY O
. O

Try O
the O
Pad B-AS
Thai I-AS
, O
it O
's O
fabulous O
and O
their O
prices B-AS
are O
so O
cheap O
! O

On O
a O
recent O
Saturday O
night O
, O
I O
was O
with O
a O
group O
of O
5 O
at O
the O
Bread O
Bar O
. O

Food B-AS
is O
great O
and O
inexpensive O
. O

The O
price B-AS
very O
reasonable O
. O

Dessert B-AS
, O
ca O
n't O
be O
missed O
, O
so O
save O
room O
! O
! O
! O

It O
can O
be O
a O
little O
confusing O
as O
to O
where O
one O
goes O
to O
order O
, O
but O
once O
the O
food B-AS
is O
ordered O
, O
you O
are O
in O
for O
a O
treat O
. O

Take O
a O
good O
sense O
of O
humor O
, O
an O
American O
express O
card O
with O
no O
limit O
, O
walk O
out O
with O
a O
lollipop O
, O
gift O
bag O
in O
hand O
and O
enough O
marketing O
materials O
for O
alain O
to O
to O
take O
the O
show O
on O
the O
road O

Ingredients B-AS
are O
organic O
which O
is O
a O
real O
plus O
for O
me O
. O

It O
was O
so O
bad O
I O
actually O
refused O
to O
pay O
for O
my O
food B-AS
. O

I O
recommend O
this O
spot O
to O
anyone O
who O
enjoys O
fine O
cuisine B-AS
at O
reasonable O
prices B-AS
. O

This O
is O
, O
by O
far O
, O
my O
favorite O
restaurant O
in O
NYC O
and O
I O
only O
wish O
it O
were O
more O
affordable O
so O
I O
could O
go O
more O
often O
! O

The O
staff B-AS
was O
very O
attentive O
, O
the O
ambience B-AS
lovely O
, O
and O
the O
food B-AS
superb O
. O

I O
love O
when O
restaurants O
think O
using O
fancy O
expensive O
ingrediants B-AS
makes O
the O
food B-AS
fine O
cuisine B-AS
, O
even O
with O
no O
idea O
how O
to O
use O
them O
. O

THe O
Pizza B-AS
and O
wine B-AS
were O
excellent O
- O
the O
service B-AS
too O
-- O
but O
what O
really O
MADE O
this O
place O
was O
the O
backyard B-AS
dining I-AS
area I-AS
. O

THE O
FRANKENSTEIN O
SHOW O
WAS O
THE O
BEST O
. O

The O
waiters B-AS
are O
sweet O
, O
the O
food B-AS
is O
tasty O
and O
the O
bill B-AS
is O
never O
too O
large O
. O

As O
a O
fan O
of O
Thai O
, O
I O
have O
tried O
quite O
a O
few O
different O
restaurants O
in O
NYC O
and O
this O
one O
was O
definitely O
the O
worst O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
superb O
, O
they O
treat O
you O
like O
family O
. O

We O
all O
had O
the O
tasting O
menu B-AS
and O
unlike O
some O
of O
the O
other O
reviews O
, O
I O
felt O
there O
was O
more O
than O
enough O
food B-AS
. O

It O
only O
took O
about O
five O
or O
so O
minutes O
to O
get O
an O
empty O
table B-AS
, O
but O
standing O
up O
was O
n't O
too O
bad O
. O

The O
menu B-AS
may O
be O
small O
, O
but O
everything O
on O
it O
is O
delicious O
. O

Too O
bad O
Latin O
Quarters O
closed O
. O

They O
had O
scrapped O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
vessel O
in O
which O
they O
make O
the O
rice B-AS
-RESULT O
, O
WE O
HAD O
LARGE O
CHUNKS O
OF O
BURNT O
RICE B-AS
IN O
OUR O
SERVING O
BOWL O
. O

It O
was O
divine O
melts O
in O
your O
mouth O
. O

Stumbled O
upon O
this O
gem O
of O
a O
pizza O
place O
and O
I O
will O
be O
going O
back O
frequently O
. O

I O
live O
a O
block O
away O
and O
go O
to O
Patsy O
's O
frequently O
. O

for O
dessert O
we O
split O
chocolate O
cake O
and O
vanilla O
gelato O
with O
espresso O
, O
which O
were O
tasty O
, O
but O
I O
thought O
a O
bit O
overpriced O
. O

When O
I O
visited O
my O
friend O
who O
lives O
in O
the O
Upper O
Eastside O
, O
she O
recommended O
that O
we O
go O
to O
this O
restaurant O
. O

Warm O
, O
comfortable O
surroundings B-AS
, O
nice O
appointments O
witness O
the O
etched O
glass O
and O
brickwork O
separating O
the O
dining B-AS
rooms I-AS
. O

We O
ran O
a O
little O
late O
for O
the O
reservation B-AS
but O
it O
was O
n't O
a O
problem O
to O
get O
our O
table B-AS
immediately O
. O

Kudos O
Haru O

We O
arrived O
on O
time O
for O
our O
reservation B-AS
and O
seated O
promptlyThe O
. O

I O
plan O
on O
eating O
here O
more O
often O
. O

I O
would O
definitely O
go O
back O
for O
a O
very O
special O
occasion O
, O
but O
not O
for O
regular O
fine O
dining B-AS
. O

The O
well O
mannered O
, O
pleasant O
staff B-AS
that O
Tony O
has O
in O
his O
employ O
. O

The O
flavors B-AS
robust O
and O
subtle O
. O

I O
came O
here O
for O
my O
friend O
's O
birthday O
and O
keep O
coming O
back O
ever O
since O
. O

All O
I O
can O
say O
is O
$ O
2 O
pints O
during O
happy O
hour O
and O
the O
some O
of O
the O
cheapest O
oysters B-AS
you O
'll O
find O
in O
the O
city O
, O
though O
the O
quality B-AS
is O
some O
of O
the O
best O
. O

I O
would O
never O
wait O
for O
a O
table B-AS
to O
eat O
, O
it O
just O
is O
not O
THAT O
great O
. O

We O
concluded O
with O
tiramisu B-AS
chocolate I-AS
cake I-AS
, O
both O
were O
delicious O
. O

The O
counter B-AS
service I-AS
is O
bad O
. O

I O
had O
a O
grat O
time O
at O
Jekyll O
and O
Hyde O
! O

Service B-AS
here O
was O
great O
, O
food B-AS
was O
fantastic O
. O

its O
a O
little O
out O
of O
the O
way O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
live O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
, O
but O
definitely O
worth O
the O
trip O
from O
wherever O
you O
are O
. O

This O
is O
such O
a O
lovely O
, O
peaceful O
place B-AS
to O
eat O
outside O
. O

and O
we O
were O
thouroughly O
disapointed O
. O

This O
is O
the O
Jackel O
and O
Hideof O
the O
restaurants O
on O
the O
UES O
. O

The O
sauce B-AS
is O
delicious O
and O
the O
crust B-AS
is O
perfect O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
place O
to O
take O
out O
- O
of O
- O
towners O
, O
and O
perfect O
for O
watching O
the O
sunset O
. O

Since O
my O
first O
dinner B-AS
I O
have O
had O
the O
chance O
to O
have O
brunch B-AS
at O
Orsay O
3x O
. O

You O
will O
pay O
a O
lot O
for O
the O
decore B-AS
, O
but O
the O
food B-AS
is O
no O
better O
or O
worse O
than O
a O
lot O
of O
other O
Chinese O
and O
Asian O
fusion O
places O
in O
NY O
. O

They O
have O
some O
great O
entrees B-AS
here O
as O
well O
. O

Our O
teenage O
kids O
love O
it O
, O
too O
. O

The O
service B-AS
is O
not O
consistently O
excellent O
- O
just O
decent O
. O

The O
food B-AS
, O
served B-AS
in O
small O
tasting O
portions B-AS
as O
an O
option O
is O
very O
good O
with O
each O
dish B-AS
being O
better O
than O
the O
next O
. O

You O
guys O
are O
awesome O
! O

They O
do O
cater B-AS
to O
American O
palates O
, O
but O
if O
you O
like O
it O
hot O
let O
them O
know O
and O
they O
are O
more O
than O
willing O
to O
oblige O
! O

I O
loved O
this O
place O
! O
! O

I O
had O
the O
mango B-AS
chicken I-AS
and O
i O
ca O
n't O
go O
on O
to O
tell O
you O
how O
delicious O
that O
was O
and O
the O
presentation B-AS
was O
beatiful O
. O

I O
care O
more O
about O
the O
food B-AS
and O
ambience B-AS
. O

Oh O
, O
but O
wait O
, O
we O
were O
out O
of O
drinks B-AS
which O
were O
also O
delightfully O
overpriced O
. O

Avoid O
at O
all O
costs O
. O

I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
this O
place O
to O
everyone O
for O
any O
occasion O
! O

The O
service B-AS
is O
fantastic O
. O

I O
recommend O
that O
you O
try O
this O
hidden O
spot O
which O
will O
surely O
blowup O
very O
soon O

The O
garlic B-AS
mashed I-AS
potatoes I-AS
are O
hands O
down O
the O
best O
in O
the O
city O
! O

Food B-AS
and O
service B-AS
was O
okay O
. O

great O
for O
a O
romantic O
evening O
, O
or O
a O
fun O
evening O
with O
friends O
. O

The O
lamb B-AS
meat I-AS
was O
under O
- O
cooked O
and O
EXTRMELY O
CHEWY O
. O

The O
best O
pad B-AS
thai I-AS
i O
' O
ve O
ever O
had O
. O

Over O
time O
, O
the O
food B-AS
quality I-AS
has O
decreased O
substantially O
, O
it O
is O
a O
lot O
less O
crowded O
than O
it O
used O
to O
, O
and O
the O
service B-AS
must O
definitely O
be O
part O
of O
the O
reason O
. O

Great O
pizza B-AS
and O
fantastic O
service B-AS
. O

We O
were O
seated O
outside B-AS
and O
the O
waiter B-AS
spilled O
red B-AS
wine I-AS
and O
hot B-AS
tea I-AS
on O
myself O
and O
my O
date O
. O

i O
would O
just O
ask O
for O
no O
oil B-AS
next O
time O
. O

While O
this O
is O
a O
pretty O
place B-AS
in O
that O
overly O
cute O
French O
way O
, O
the O
food B-AS
was O
insultingly O
horrible O
. O

I O
went O
there O
for O
lunch B-AS
and O
it O
was O
not O
as O
good O
as O
I O
expected O
from O
the O
reviews O
I O
read O
. O

I O
really O
did O
n't O
know O
what O
to O
expect O
for O
a O
restaurant O
that O
literally O
overlooks O
the O
main O
hall O
of O
Grand O
Central O
. O

None O
of O
that O
yucky O
whipped O
stuff O
. O

The O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
is O
n't O
great O
, O
and O
the O
desserts B-AS
are O
shipped O
in O
from O
Bruno O
's O
down O
the O
street O
, O
which O
is O
not O
as O
good O
as O
it O
used O
to O
be O
. O

I O
ordered O
a O
Lassi B-AS
and O
asked O
4 O
times O
for O
it O
but O
never O
got O
it O
. O

Their O
coffee B-AS
is O
quite O
good O
too O
! O

I O
would O
not O
recommend O
this O
place O
to O
anyone O
. O

great O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
italian O
, O
good O
food B-AS
, O
service O
was O
INITIALLY O
fine O
. O

Despite O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
space B-AS
is O
large O
, O
they O
' O
ve O
overcrowded O
the O
floor O
with O
tables B-AS
. O

i O
know O
, O
you O
were O
too O
busy O
showing O
off O
your O
vintage O
tee O
shirt O
and O
looking O
bored O
, O
but O
my O
agenda O
is O
i O
' O
m O
here O
to O
eat O
and O
enjoy O
the O
company O
of O
friends O
, O
seeking O
a O
pleasant O
experience O
. O

As O
far O
as O
the O
service O
goes O
, O
the O
waitresses O
were O
not O
particularly O
friendly O
, O
but O
they O
got O
the O
job O
done O
. O

They O
are O
not O
helpful O
in O
the O
least O
and O
will O
give O
you O
the O
grand O
run O
around O
so O
by O
the O
time O
the O
event O
date O
rolls O
around O
you O
will O
not O
only O
regret O
chosing O
this O
place B-AS
, O
but O
also O
become O
hostile O
! O

I O
had O
to O
ask O
her O
three O
times O
before O
she O
finally O
came O
back O
with O
the O
dish B-AS
I O
ve O
requested O
. O

Normally O
that O
would O
be O
improper O
, O
however O
they O
were O
all O
delicious O
and O
my O
host B-AS
did O
not O
complain O
. O

Taxan B-AS
delicious O
! O

Perhaps O
it O
was O
an O
off O
night O
, O
but O
it O
was O
suprisingly O
average O
for O
a O
93 O
rating O
. O

Unlike O
other O
places O
in O
NYC O
where O
the O
sandwiches B-AS
you O
want O
only O
come O
as O
a O
triple O
- O
decker O
, O
here O
you O
can O
get O
what O
you O
want O
in O
a O
reasonably O
- O
sized O
portion B-AS
and O
price B-AS
. O

Southern B-AS
Indian I-AS

is O
still O
there O

too O
. O

Restaurant O
snobs O
need O
not O
bother O
, O
this O
is O
a O
small O
, O
neighborhood O
kind O
of O
place B-AS
. O

Have O
been O
dozens O
of O
times O
and O
never O
failed O
to O
enjoy O
the O
experience O
. O

They O
could O
n't O
even O
make O
a O
salad B-AS
that O
was O
appealing O
. O

For O
two O
people O
with O
tip B-AS
was O
less O
than O
$ O
25 O
bucks O
. O

Killer O
Sushi B-AS
! O

Of O
course O
the O
reason O
its O
so O
packed O
is O
because O
the O
food B-AS
is O
so O
delicious O
! O

Staffs B-AS
are O
not O
that O
friendly O
, O
but O
the O
taste B-AS
covers O
all O
. O

The O
jukebox B-AS
plays O
everything O
from O
Italian O
Opera O
to O
The O
Strokes O
. O

And O
I O
' O
ve O
been O
to O
many O
NYC O
delis O
. O

This O
place O
is O
always O
packed O
. O

Much O
of O
the O
time O
it O
seems O
like O
they O
do O
not O
care O
about O
you O
. O

Plus O
they O
made O
a O
perfect O
martini B-AS
. O

I O
am O
not O
sure O
if O
I O
would O
call O
the O
food B-AS
here O
Indian O
as O
it O
is O
a O
fusion O
of O
what O
seems O
to O
be O
French O
with O
an O
Indian O
or O
exotic O
touch O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
eaten O
thai O
many O
times O
, O
and O
am O
very O
familiar O
with O
the O
cuisine B-AS
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
was O
attentive O
. O

Their O
Margarita B-AS
is O
best O
I O
' O
ve O
had O
since O
I O
' O
ve O
returned O
from O
Naples O
! O

I O
highly O
recommend O
the O
restaurant O
based O
on O
our O
experience O
last O
night O
. O

The O
tastes B-AS
makes O
your O
mouth O
water O
for O
more O
. O

I O
came O
into O
the O
city O
to O
try O
out O
this O
restaurant O
because O
a O
friend O
had O
recommended O
it O
to O
my O
husband O
. O

Their O
sake B-AS
list I-AS
was O
extensive O
, O
but O
we O
were O
looking O
for O
Purple O
Haze O
, O
which O
was O
n't O
listed O
but O
made O
for O
us O
upon O
request O
! O

The O
tables B-AS
are O
crammed O
way O
too O
close O
, O
the O
menu B-AS
is O
typical O
of O
any O
Italian O
restaurant O
, O
and O
the O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
is O
simply O
overpriced O
. O

All O
in O
all O
a O
wonderful O
experience O
, O
ca O
n't O
wait O
to O
come O
back O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
actually O
aweful O
. O

after O
dining O
at O
BOG O
over O
twenty O
times O
now O
, O
its O
official O
! O
. O

They O
are O
served B-AS
with O
a O
free O
appetizer B-AS
and O
the O
portions B-AS
are O
perfect O
for O
lunch B-AS
. O

There O
is O
actually O
space B-AS
to O
breathe O
and O
the O
decor B-AS
sets O
the O
tone O
for O
an O
intimate O
dinner B-AS
. O

We O
went O
around O
9 O
, O
30 O
on O
a O
Friday O
and O
it O
had O
died O
down O
a O
bit O
by O
then O
so O
the O
service B-AS
was O
great O
! O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
both O
ordered O
the O
Steak B-AS
, O
medium O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
the O
rice B-AS
had O
no O
seasoning B-AS
, O
so O
the O
sushi B-AS
was O
bland O
and O
disgusting O
. O

This O
place O
has O
realy O
fresh O
sushi B-AS
and O
a O
nice O
large O
menu B-AS
of O
Japanese B-AS
classic I-AS
cuisine I-AS
. O

The O
sushi B-AS
is O
average O
and O
the O
prices B-AS
are O
anything O
but O
. O

My O
wife O
and O
I O
also O
enjoyed O
the O
spinach B-AS
, O
the O
Shanghai B-AS
low I-AS
mein I-AS
, O
and O
other O
attractions O
. O

Owner B-AS
must O
have O
coem O
on O
this O
website O
to O
give O
himself O
credit O
. O

Turned O
out O
there O
was O
full O
service B-AS
upstairs O
and O
sat O
down O
. O

I O
would O
go O
back O
. O

Definitely O
will O
be O
back O
! O

Several O
of O
the O
dim B-AS
sum I-AS
orders I-AS
had O
about O
6 O
- O
8 O
pieces O
. O

I O
' O
m O
not O
sure O
why O
these O
other O
reviewers O
are O
whining O
so O
much O
. O

they O
live O
up O
to O
the O
thai O
way O
of O
living O
. O

If O
you O
have O
a O
dumpling B-AS
fetish O
i O
suggest O
you O
try O
some O
here O
! O

Three O
page O

one O

and O
horedevous B-AS

The O
food B-AS
is O
consistently O
wonderful O
, O
I O
' O
ve O
been O
coming O
here O
for O
years O
, O
and O
the O
owner B-AS
has O
always O
been O
accomodating O
and O
friendly O
. O

The O
waiters B-AS
and O
owners B-AS
were O
nonchalant O
about O
this O
and O
promised O
to O
call O
the O
exterminator O
but O
were O
n't O
as O
dismayed O
or O
apologetic O
as O
I O
would O
have O
expected O
. O

I O
live O
nearby O
and O
when O
they O
first O
opened O
, O
I O
ate O
there O
a O
lot O
. O

And O
the O
food B-AS
was O
fantastic O
. O

This O
is O
the O
kind O
of O
place O
you O
'd O
like O
to O
take O
all O
your O
friends O
to O
and O
still O
keep O
a O
secret O
. O

If O
you O
're O
looking O
for O
a O
place O
to O
sit O
down O
, O
have O
a O
drink B-AS
and O
conversations O
with O
friends O
, O
go O
to O
sweet O
- O
n O
- O
tart O
and O
order O
yourself O
a O
hong B-AS
- I-AS
kong I-AS
styled I-AS
milk I-AS
and O
tea B-AS
with I-AS
tapioca I-AS
pearls I-AS
( I-AS
hot I-AS
) I-AS
. O

Aside O
from O
the O
Sea B-AS
Urchin I-AS
, O
the O
chef B-AS
recommended O
an O
assortment B-AS
of I-AS
fish I-AS
including O
Fatty B-AS
Yellow I-AS
Tail I-AS
, O
Boton B-AS
Shrimp I-AS
, O
Blue B-AS
Fin I-AS
Torro I-AS
( I-AS
Fatty I-AS
Tuna I-AS
) I-AS
, O
Sea B-AS
Eel I-AS
, O
etc O
. O

They O
're O
also O
friendlier O
here O
, O
especially O
the O
owner B-AS
, O
Kenny O
. O

While O
the O
room B-AS
is O
not O
particularly O
comfortable O
, O
once O
you O
're O
seated O
you O
'll O
forget O
about O
everything O
except O
what O
's O
on O
your O
plate B-AS
. O

I O
' O
ve O
lived O
in O
NYC O
all O
my O
life O
and O
had O
never O
before O
seen O
so O
many O
waterbugs B-AS
in O
one O
place O
except O
in O
a O
really O
bad O
dream O
. O

Winnie O
and O
her O
staff B-AS
are O
the O
best O
crew B-AS
you O
can O
find O
serving B-AS
you O
. O

The O
ambiance B-AS
is O
minimal O
the O
food B-AS
is O
not O
phenomenal O
, O
but O
some O
dishes B-AS
are O
quite O
good O
, O
such O
as O
the O
eggplant B-AS
parmesan I-AS
, O
veal B-AS
in I-AS
carozza I-AS
chicken I-AS
saltimbocca I-AS
. O

My O
host B-AS
asked O
for O
appetizers B-AS
for O
the O
group O
and O
the O
waiter B-AS
gave O
us O
not O
only O
what O
we O
ordered O
, O
but O
some O
other O
items O
that O
were O
not O
ordered O
. O

You O
can O
even O
get O
packages O
of O
the O
chutneys B-AS
to O
stock O
your O
fridge O
! O

The O
bar B-AS
has O
various O
selections O
and O
the O
mixed B-AS
drink I-AS
special I-AS
is O
a O
catcher O
! O
2 O
for O
1 O
's O
. O

Slightly O
on O
the O
pricey O
side O
but O
worth O
it O
! O

If O
it O
is O
n't O
for O
the O
food B-AS
A+++ O
, O
it O
must O
be O
the O
service B-AS
or O
the O
ambience B-AS
. O

During O
the O
course O
of O
the O
past O
3 O
months O
, O
the O
chef B-AS
and O
staff B-AS
changed O
and O
it O
was O
not O
for O
the O
better O
. O

I O
like O
the O
ambience B-AS
, O
it O
's O
very O
dark O
and O
original O
. O

Not O
the O
typical O
NYC O
gimmick O
theme O
restaurant O
. O

We O
were O
exploring O
Grand O
Central O
and O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
eat O
in O
the O
food O
court O
. O

Overall O
, O
not O
worth O
the O
money B-AS
. O

This O
place O
is O
not O
worth O
the O
prices B-AS
. O

We O
left O
after O
one O
drink B-AS
. O

Everything O
that O
happened O
was O
not O
even O
up O
to O
mediocre O
. O

Our O
last O
time O
there O
a O
few O
weeks O
ago O
was O
early O
at O
5 O
pm O
and O
it O
was O
very O
crowded O
and O
noisy O
. O

Pick O
a O
bagel O
has O
the O
best O
bagels B-AS
in O
the O
city O
. O

You O
are O
paying O
for O
the O
atmosphere O
, O
which O
is O
nice O
, O
but O
can O
be O
had O
in O
numerous O
places O
in O
Bay O
Ridge O
. O

It O
's O
called O
Gnochi O
alla O
nona O
and O
is O
found O
under O
Chef O
Specials O
. O

It O
is O
one O
the O
nicest O
outdoor O
restaurants O
I O
have O
ever O
seen O
in O
NY O
-- O
I O
am O
from O
Italy O
and O
this O
place O
rivals O
the O
ones O
in O
my O
country O
. O

Yes O
you O
have O
to O
wait B-AS
to O
be O
seat B-AS
and O
because O
its O
small O
there O
is O
no O
waiting B-AS
area I-AS
and O
the O
seat B-AS
at O
the O
bar B-AS
was O
all O
taken O
. O

The O
last O
two O
times O
I O
ordered O
from O
here O
my O
food B-AS
was O
soo O
spicy O
that O
I O
could O
barely O
eat O
it O
, O
and O
the O
spice B-AS
took O
away O
from O
the O
flavor B-AS
of O
the O
dish B-AS
. O

The O
fried B-AS
dumplings I-AS
are O
GREAT O
! O

This O
place O
has O
the O
best O
Chinese O
style O
BBQ B-AS
ribs I-AS
in O
the O
city O
. O

I O
ve O
been O
here O
so O
many O
times O
the O
waiters B-AS
know O
my O
name O
. O

The O
decor O
is O
very O
simple O
but O
comfortable O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
been O
frequenting O
The O
Tasting O
Room O
since O
it O
first O
arrived O
in O
the O
East O
Village O
and O
I O
' O
ve O
never O
been O
disappointed O
. O

We O
figured O
we O
never O
had O
Argentinian B-AS
Pizza I-AS
before O
so O
we O
grabbed O
our O
lunch B-AS
there O
, O
sharing O
a O
large O
Pelligrino B-AS
, O
a O
pizza B-AS
of O
two O
of O
their O
specials O
, O
one O
was O
goat B-AS
cheese I-AS
the O
other O
blue B-AS
cheese I-AS
, O
and O
both O
were O
excellent O
. O

Heartland O
Brewery O
is O
a O
great O
way O
to O
start O
or O
finish O
your O
day O
. O

The O
kamasutra B-AS
and O
bombay B-AS
cosmopolitan I-AS
are O
excellent O
and O
will O
have O
you O
tipsy O
in O
no O
time O
. O

This O
is O
the O
perfect O
date B-AS
spot I-AS
for O
Williamsburg O
couples O
. O

The O
dim B-AS
sum I-AS
here O
is O
only O
so O
- O
so O
. O

It O
was O
raining O
, O
and O
we O
figured O
why O
not O
? O

$ O
6 O
and O
there O
is O
much O
tasty O
food B-AS
, O
all O
of O
it O
fresh O
and O
continually O
refilled O
. O

Just O
straight O
up O
cheap O
, O
good O
food B-AS
. O

Another O
welcome O
addition O
to O
the O
neighborhood O
. O

Seating B-AS
is O
ok O
even O
though O
sometimes O
there O
's O
alot O
of O
people O
. O

This O
time O
, O
I O
prefer O
not O
to O
go O
into O
detail O
. O

Even O
with O
a O
relatively O
inexpensive O
botle O
of O
wine O
, O
if O
you O
can O
call O
$ O
7000 O
inexpensive O
, O
the O
cost B-AS
is O
through O
the O
roof O
for O
better O
than O
average O
fare O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
slow O
, O
but O
the O
people B-AS
were O
friendly O
. O

Steamed O
fresh O
so O
brought O
hot O
hot O
hot O
to O
your O
table O
. O

The O
steak B-AS
was O
very O
fatty O
and O
the O
sauce B-AS
was O
overpowering O
and O
not O
very O
tasty O
. O

My O
only O
problem O
is O
that O
you O
are O
literally O
sitting O
on O
top O
of O
the O
people O
next O
to O
you O
! O

And O
affordable O
. O

The O
staff B-AS
makes O
you O
feel O
at O
home O
, O
the O
food B-AS
is O
great O
and O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
WONDERFUL O
! O

i O
actually O
feel O
like O
i O
should O
keep O
it O
a O
secret O
. O

The O
food O
is O
alright O
, O
some O
stuff O
is O
good O
, O
some O
is O
not O
like O
the O
steak B-AS
dish I-AS
which O
tends O
to O
be O
dry O
. O

Not O
only O
would O
I O
not O
recommend O
Jimmy O
's O
restaurants O
to O
friends O
, O
I O
would O
strongly O
suggest O
they O
go O
anywhere O
but O
. O

They O
have O
a O
very O
diverse O
menu B-AS
so O
its O
something O
for O
everybody O
. O

Haru O
on O
Park O
S O
is O
simply O
disgusting O
. O

The O
staff B-AS
was O
too O
busy O
ordering O
sushi B-AS
for O
dinner B-AS
and O
then O
laying O
it O
out O
to O
eat O
on O
the O
bar B-AS
to O
even O
bring O
me O
my O
check B-AS
. O

As O
a O
long O
- O
time O
patron O
of O
Mamoun O
's O
, O
I O
always O
figured O
that O
I O
had O
found O
the O
best O
late O
night O
food B-AS
spot I-AS
in O
the O
city O
. O

I O
drop O
more O
dollar O
bills O
here O
than O
your O
uncle O
after O
a O
weekend O
at O
Scores O
. O

The O
bagel B-AS
was O
huge O
. O

Go O
there O
to O
relax O
and O
feel O
like O
your O
somewhere O
else O
. O

Get O
the O
tuna B-AS
of O
gari O
. O

I O
like O
the O
somosas B-AS
, O
chai B-AS
, O
and O
the O
chole B-AS
, O
but O
the O
dhosas B-AS
and O
dhal B-AS
were O
kinda O
dissapointing O
. O

It O
was O
a O
very O
nice O
surprise O
. O

Edible O
but O
really O
a O
ripoff O
at O
those O
prices B-AS
given O
what O
s O
in O
the O
area O
. O

The O
staff O
has O
been O
nice O
, O
but O
they O
seemed O
really O
stressed O
and O
the O
unisex O
bathroom B-AS
needs O
to O
be O
cleaned O
more O
often O
. O

I O
am O
French O
and O
I O
really O
felt O
like O
home O
! O
! O
! O

I O
have O
been O
to O
Casimir O
over O
5 O
times O
and O
I O
have O
always O
had O
a O
great O
time O
there O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
the O
only O
thing O
good O
about O
this O
restaurant O
. O

It O
's O
usually O
packed O
for O
good O
reason O
, O
esp O
. O

Service B-AS
friendly O
and O
attentive O
. O

I O
love O
going O
there O
! O

I O
can O
not O
recommend O
OG O
more O
highly O
if O
I O
tried O
, O
check O
it O
out O
for O
yourself O
. O

It O
was O
the O
first O
place O
we O
ate O
on O
our O
first O
trip O
to O
New O
York O
, O
and O
it O
will O
be O
the O
last O
place O
we O
stop O
as O
we O
head O
out O
of O
town O
on O
our O
next O
trip O
to O
New O
York O
. O

Service O
was O
very O
prompt O
but O
slightly O
rushed O
. O

Great O
food B-AS
, O
great O
decor B-AS
, O
great O
service B-AS
. O

And O
, O
atlhough O
tables B-AS
opened O
up O
next O
to O
us O
and O
we O
ASKED O
for O
a O
slightly O
larger O
space B-AS
, O
they O
left O
us O
awkardly O
seated O
. O

The O
palak B-AS
paneer I-AS
was O
standard O
, O
and O
I O
was O
not O
a O
fan O
of O
the O
malai B-AS
kofta I-AS
. O

I O
' O
ve O
dined O
at O
Alain O
Ducasse O
's O
restaurant O
in O
Monte O
Carlo O
for O
half O
the O
price B-AS
for O
the O
same O
excellent O
dining B-AS
experience O
. O

Yeah O
, O
sometimes O
the O
service B-AS
can O
be O
slow O
. O

There O
was O
no O
ambiance B-AS
. O

Save O
your O
money O
and O
do O
n't O
waste O
your O
calories O
, O
go O
to O
Margharita O
's O
on O
Washington O
Street O
instead O
, O
they O
have O
amazing O
food B-AS
and O
the O
BEST O
service B-AS
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
attentive O
without O
being O
overbearing O
and O
each O
dish B-AS
we O
tried O
was O
wonderful O
from O
the O
spring B-AS
rolls I-AS
to O
the O
cod B-AS
with I-AS
pineapple I-AS
tempura I-AS
. O

But O
trust O
me O
it O
is O
so O
worth O
it O
. O

It O
is O
not O
a O
place O
for O
tourists O
or O
someone O
who O
has O
never O
dined O
in O
Bay O
Ridge O
. O

THe O
perfect O
spot O
. O

The O
only O
weird O
thing O
was O
if O
we O
got O
a O
bottle B-AS
, O
the O
waitress B-AS
would O
have O
simply O
multiplied O
the O
glass O
price B-AS
X4 O
, O
which O
makes O
no O
sense O
whatsoever O
. O

They O
sell O
special O
sushi B-AS
, O
everything O
have O
a O
topping B-AS
, O
sauce B-AS
and O
etc O
. O

DO O
not O
try O
unless O
you O
're O
just O
going O
there O
to O
hang O
out O
like O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
hipsters O
who O
apparently O
have O
no O
sense O
of O
taste B-AS
. O

They O
never O
came O
back O
to O
refill O
our O
glasses O
again O
. O

The O
place B-AS
is O
small O
and O
intimate O
and O
you O
may O
feel O
a O
little O
crowded O
, O
but O
the O
service B-AS
is O
excellent O
and O
it O
's O
great O
for O
friends O
out O
, O
a O
romantic O
date O
, O
or O
a O
special O
occassion O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
also O
very O
good O
. O

I O
took O
my O
girlfriend O
there O
for O
her O
birthday O
last O
night O
and O
we O
had O
a O
relaxing O
, O
really O
good O
meal B-AS
. O

I O
would O
not O
have O
been O
so O
disappointed O
with O
the O
portions B-AS
if O
the O
qualities B-AS
were O
good O
enough O
to O
make O
up O
for O
it O
, O
but O
they O
were O
not O
! O

They O
're O
rude O
at O
times O
, O
and O
not O
very O
friendly O
. O

I O
' O
m O
happy O
to O
have O
Nosh O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
and O
the O
food B-AS
is O
very O
comforting O
. O

Good O
atmosphere B-AS
, O
combination O
of O
all O
the O
hottest O
music B-AS
dress I-AS
cod I-AS
is O
relatively O
strict O
except O
on O
Fridays O
. O

They O
kindly O
brought O
us O
more O
to O
see O
if O
it O
was O
better O
, O
but O
it O
was O
not O
! O

love O
the O
food B-AS
. O

I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
Nina O
's O
to O
anyone O
who O
wants O
to O
have O
a O
romantic O
dinner B-AS
in O
a O
heart O
warming O
surrounding B-AS
filled O
with O
candles B-AS
and O
family O
pictures B-AS
. O

All O
the O
desserts B-AS
the O
group O
tried O
got O
favorable O
reviews O
. O

There O
's O
something O
smooth O
about O
sipping O
sake B-AS
upper O
east O
side O
style O
. O

It O
's O
a O
nice O
place B-AS
to O
relax O
and O
have O
conversation O
. O

This O
place O
has O
got O
to O
be O
the O
best O
japanese O
restaurant O
in O
the O
new O
york O
area O
. O

Best O
Reuben B-AS
sandwich I-AS
ever O
! O

Lucky O
Strike O
is O
a O
great O
casual O
place B-AS
to O
just O
grab O
a O
bite O
to O
eat O
. O

Wonderful O
strawberry B-AS
daiquiries I-AS
as O
well O
! O

Going O
to O
Volare O
is O
like O
going O
to O
your O
favorite O
aunt O
's O
house O
for O
dinner B-AS
, O
assuming O
that O
your O
aunt O
is O
a O
great O
Italian O
cook O
. O

The O
sushi B-AS
has O
been O
from O
average O
to O
below O
average O
, O
the O
wait B-AS
service I-AS
has O
always O
been O
sub O
- O
par O
the O
atmosphere O
goes O
from O
nice O
to O
really O
irritating O
if O
you O
sit O
in O
the O
area B-AS
beyond O
the O
kitchen O
, O
the O
acousitcs O
are O
horrid O
, O
everything O
echoes O
is O
extremely O
loud O
. O

I O
loved O
it O
and O
would O
go O
again O
. O

Frites B-AS
were O
delicious O
if O
a O
bit O
on O
the O
thick O
side O
. O

SO O
SO O
SO O
SO O
SO O
good O
! O

Alone O
for O
100 O
bucks O
, O
it O
is O
really O
overprice O
. O

Out O
of O
the O
hundreds O
of O
Italian O
restaurants O
in O
Queens O
, O
this O
is O
among O
the O
best O
. O

Very O
good O
value O

Here O
you O
get O
the O
zen B-AS
feel I-AS
without O
feeling O
rigid O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
putting O
your O
name O
down O
and O
then O
getting O
a O
drink B-AS
at O
a O
local O
bar B-AS
first O
though O
because O
of O
the O
wait B-AS
time I-AS
. O

I O
fell O
in O
love O
with O
the O
egg B-AS
noodles I-AS
in I-AS
the I-AS
beef I-AS
broth I-AS
with I-AS
shrimp I-AS
dumplings I-AS
and I-AS
slices I-AS
of I-AS
BBQ I-AS
roast I-AS
pork I-AS
. O

I O
keep O
my O
fingers O
crossed O
the O
whole O
subway O
ride O
hoping O
that O
there O
will O
be O
a O
table B-AS
I O
can O
sit O
at O
by O
myself O
and O
not O
have O
to O
share O
with O
the O
rice B-AS
congee I-AS
soup I-AS
people O
. O

Overall O
, O
the O
best O
bagel B-AS
in O
town O
. O

Everything O
a O
NY O
pizza O
joint O
should O
be O
. O

It O
was O
huge O
, O
delicious O
, O
fresh O
, O
and O
will O
be O
the O
reason O
we O
return O
. O

We O
go O
often O
. O

Light O
, O
refreshing O
summer B-AS
rolls I-AS
not O
fried O
remind O
me O
of O
Vietnamese O
places O
in O
Paris O
. O

The O
sushi B-AS
seemed O
pretty O
fresh O
and O
was O
adequately O
proportioned O
. O

moral O
stay O
away O
. O

but O
the O
service B-AS
was O
a O
bit O
slow O
. O

Spreads B-AS
and O
toppings B-AS
are O
great O
, O
though O
a O
bit O
pricey O
. O

When O
I O
saw O
that O
their O
website O
had O
a O
link O
to O
da O
Ciro O
in O
Napoli O
, O
I O
knew O
there O
was O
going O
to O
be O
good O
pizza B-AS
! O

No O
one O
asked O
what O
was O
wrong O
as O
we O
left O
with O
nothing O
touched O
on O
our O
plates B-AS
. O

Indoor B-AS
was O
very O
cozy O
and O
cute O
. O

We O
had O
a O
3 O
hour O
brunch B-AS
they O
definitely O
do O
not O
rush O
you O
and O
they O
kept O
the O
unlimited O
mimosas B-AS
flowing O
the O
whole O
time O
. O

And O
their O
prices B-AS
are O
very O
high O
, O
they O
actually O
think O
that O
they O
can O
get O
away O
with O
charging O
such O
prices B-AS
for O
such O
terrible O
food B-AS
and O
service B-AS
! O

They O
're O
terrific O
! O
! O

The O
service B-AS
was O
excellent O
, O
the O
food B-AS
was O
excellent O
, O
but O
the O
entire O
experience O
was O
very O
cool O
. O

The O
service B-AS
is O
good O
and O
the O
resturant O
is O
clean O
. O

Great O
spot B-AS
, O
whether O
looking O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
drinks B-AS
or O
quiet O
dinner B-AS
. O

Just O
stick O
with O
the O
small O
dishes B-AS
! O

The O
cafe B-AS
itself O
was O
really O
nice O
with O
comfortable O
outdoor B-AS
chairs I-AS
and O
tables B-AS
, O
but O
the O
service B-AS
could O
have O
been O
better O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
rarely O
had O
a O
problem O
with O
slow O
staff B-AS
in O
the O
10 O
years O
I O
' O
ve O
been O
going O
. O

Food B-AS
is O
excellent O
. O

This O
place O
is O
a O
literal O
hole O
- O
in O
- O
the O
- O
wall O
that O
is O
buried O
within O
Doyers O
, O
right O
off O
of O
Pell O
St O
barber O
's O
alley O
in O
Chinatown O
. O

They O
outshine O
HH O
. O

Although O
we O
were O
looking O
for O
regular O
lettuce B-AS
and O
some O
walnuts B-AS
the O
salads B-AS
we O
got O
were O
great O
. O

Excellent O
lunch B-AS
buffet I-AS
for O
only O
$ O
695 O
. O

We O
were O
sorry O
to O
check O
them O
off O
our O
list O
as O
we O
had O
enjoyed O
and O
recommended O
the O
place O
in O
the O
past O
. O

If O
you O
're O
not O
familiar O
with O
the O
cuisine B-AS
, O
you O
may O
encounter O
problems O
ordering O
here O
and O
be O
sure O
to O
bring O
plenty O
of O
cash O
with O
you O
as O
they O
do O
n't O
accept O
credit O
cards O
. O

both O
are O
very O
reasonably O
priced B-AS
around O
$ O
8 O
for O
dinner B-AS
and O
$ O
5 O
for O
lunch B-AS
, O
and O
are O
delicious O
and O
filling O
. O

Problem O
is O
nothing O
at O
Prune O
is O
particularly O
memorable O
. O

Ambience B-AS
is O
so O
cute O
and O
quaint O
, O
good O
for O
business O
although O
we O
were O
there O
on O
vacation O
. O

The O
portion B-AS
sizes I-AS
here O
are O
huge O
, O
and O
the O
sushi B-AS
is O
good O
. O

Just O
wish O
they O
'd O
expand O
. O

My O
boyfriend O
ate O
tuna B-AS
and O
it O
was O
cooked O
perfectly O
! O

This O
was O
n't O
the O
expected O
menu B-AS
comprised O
only O
of O
pad B-AS
thai I-AS
and O
tom B-AS
yum I-AS
soup I-AS
, O
but O
I O
thought O
that O
was O
what O
made O
the O
place O
so O
special O
. O

Good O
food B-AS
at O
the O
restaurant O
a O
bit O
expensive O
, O
but O
great O
if O
you O
want O
to O
impress O
your O
date O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
Caviar O
Russe O
to O
anyone O
who O
wants O
delicious O
top O
grade O
caviar B-AS
and O
fantastic O
service B-AS
. O

You O
ca O
n't O
say O
its O
cheap O
because O
food O
is O
cheaper O
in O
Chinatown O
. O

I O
have O
eaten O
there O
3 O
- O
4 O
times O
and O
the O
food B-AS
was O
always O
good O
. O

keep O
up O
the O
good O
work O
. O

I O
was O
n't O
thrilled O
to O
have O
to O
wait B-AS
on O
line O
for O
thirty O
minutes O
, O
but O
I O
guess O
that O
's O
the O
price O
you O
pay O
for O
a O
popular O
place O
. O

great O
eats B-AS
, O
good O
times O
. O

Make O
sure O
you O
try O
this O
place O
as O
often O
as O
you O
can O
. O

Grilled O
whole O
fish B-AS
wonderful O
, O
great O
spicing O
. O

For O
years O
, O
I O
thought O
Tuscan O
cuisine O
was O
the O
best O
, O
but O
Salvatore O
converted O
me O
to O
the O
hearty O
Neapolitan B-AS
fare I-AS
on O
my O
first O
visit O
. O

Plus O
, O
when O
our O
entrees B-AS
were O
held O
up O
in O
the O
kitchen O
on O
a O
busy O
Saturday O
night O
, O
the O
owner B-AS
sent O
over O
complimentary O
summer B-AS
rolls I-AS
to O
hold O
us O
over O
! O

The O
service B-AS
was O
great O
as O
well O
. O

Try O
the O
lobster B-AS
teriyaki I-AS
and O
the O
rose B-AS
special I-AS
roll I-AS
. O

Another O
plus O
is O
most O
of O
the O
entrees B-AS
are O
approx O
. O

I O
will O
go O
back O
to O
Suan O
soon O
! O

Loved O
it O
! O

The O
food B-AS
was O
delicious O
, O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
was O
relaxed O
, O
and O
we O
have O
now O
adopted O
Plate O
347 O
as O
our O
Secret O
on O
Second O
! O

We O
were O
pleasantly O
surprised O
. O

From O
the O
moment O
we O
walked O
in O
they O
were O
more O
than O
accomodating O
even O
though O
the O
place B-AS
was O
packed O
. O

It O
is O
LOUD O
, O
HOT O
and O
DARK O
. O

I O
found O
the O
food B-AS
, O
service B-AS
and O
value B-AS
exceptional O
everytime O
I O
have O
been O
there O
. O

We O
ate O
at O
this O
Thai O
place O
following O
the O
reviews O
but O
very O
unhappy O
with O
the O
foods B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
definitely O
good O
, O
but O
I O
left O
a O
bit O
disappointed O
. O

I O
am O
a O
100 O
lb O
girl O
, O
had O
a O
glass B-AS
of I-AS
wine I-AS
and O
a O
glass B-AS
of I-AS
beer I-AS
prior O
to O
the O
dinner B-AS
, O
and O
I O
was O
still O
HUNGRY O
after O
my O
visit O
to O
this O
place O

grace O
, O
but O
service B-AS
staff I-AS
, O

There O
is O
a O
downside O
if O

in O
- O
the O
delivery B-AS
guys I-AS
have O
MAJOR O
attitude O
. O

Will O
give O

The O
all O
- O
Italian O
staff B-AS
is O
warm O
and O
engaging O
from O
the O
start O
. O

Village O
is O
one O
of O
those O
places O
that O
scores O
on O
all O
fronts O
. O

The O
prices B-AS
are O
exceptionally O
reasonable O
for O
food B-AS
of O
this O
caliber O
. O

If O
you O
go O
here O
, O
your O
focus O
should O
be O
the O
Tamarind B-AS
Margaritas I-AS
. O

It O
is O
the O
best O
hidden O
spot O
there O
and O
I O
rave O
about O
it O
to O
everyone O
. O

The O
filet B-AS
mignon I-AS
dish I-AS
was O
superb O
! O

I O
had O
been O
a O
regular O
due O
to O
the O
consistently O
good O
food B-AS
and O
ease O
of O
getting B-AS
a I-AS
table I-AS
. O

Ca O
n't O
wait O
wait O
for O
my O
next O
visit O

This O
place B-AS
is O
the O
most O
Japanese O

get O
. O

The O

great O
food B-AS
, O
lt O
's O
of O
it O
, O
more O
then O
one O
person O
can O
eat O
! O

I O
did O
n't O
expect O
to O
like O
Nosh O
as O
much O
as O
I O
did O
, O
but O
the O
pastrami B-AS
on I-AS
challah I-AS
sandwich I-AS
I O
had O
was O
otherworldly O
, O
the O
soups B-AS
are O
like O
Mom O
's O
, O
and O
the O
knishes B-AS
give O
Yonah O
Schimmel O
's O
a O
run O
for O
its O
money O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
nothing O
special O
, O
but O
it O
feels O
like O
a O
Sushi O
establishment O
in O
Tokyo O
. O

Cozy O
romantic O
atomosphere B-AS
with O
only O
around O
15 O
tables B-AS
at O
most O
. O

This O
place O
is O
worth O
going O
even O
if O
only O
for O
their O
beer B-AS
. O

I O
really O
like O
both O
the O
scallops B-AS
and O
the O
mahi B-AS
mahi I-AS
( I-AS
on I-AS
saffron I-AS
risotto I-AS
! O
. O

The O
ambience B-AS
was O
so O
fun O
, O
and O
the O
prices B-AS
were O
great O
, O
on O
top O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
food B-AS
was O
really O
tasty O
. O

Do O
not O
get O
the O
Go B-AS
Go I-AS
Hamburgers I-AS
, O
no O

what O
the O
reviews O
say O
. O

The O
sandwhiches B-AS
are O
out O
- O
of O
- O
this O
world O

If O

a O

Stay O
away O
from O
this O
place O
. O

Good O
, O
because O
hey O
, O
it O
's O
more O
food B-AS
, O
but O
bad O
because O
dim B-AS
sum I-AS
is O
supposed O
to O
be O
smaller O
portions B-AS
so O
you O
can O
try O
out O
more O
dishes B-AS
and O
smaller O
so O
that O
each O
dish B-AS
is O
cheap O
. O

While O
most O
people O
can O
attest O
to O
spending O
over O
$ O
50 O
on O
drinks B-AS
in O
New O
York O
bars B-AS
and O
hardly O
feeling O
a O
thing O
, O
the O
drinks B-AS
here O
are O
plentiful O
and O
unique O
. O

Complimentary O

when O
the O

saw O
me O
opening O
a O
gift O
, O
I O
received O
my O

INCREDIBLY O
POOR O

AN O
FOOD B-AS
QUALITY I-AS
AT O
EXORBITANT O
PRICES B-AS

I O
have O
been O
about O
4 O
times O
and O
have O
always O
had O
a O
great O
meal B-AS
. O

I O
go O
back O
in O

like O
three O
times O
on O
average O
until O
I O
ca O
n't O
walk O
anymore O
. O

We O
usually O
just O
get O
some O
of O
the O
dinner B-AS
specials I-AS
and O
they O
are O
very O
reasonably O
priced B-AS
and O
very O
tasty O
. O

Horrible O
food B-AS
and O
Horrible O
service B-AS
. O

The O
wine B-AS
and O

plate O
are O
plentiful O
and O
ca O
n't O
wait O
to O
try O
the O
fondue B-AS
or O
table B-AS

. O

Bleecker O
St O
Pizza O
is O
the O
best O
! O

I O
DO O
NOT O
RECOMMEND O
THE O
HEARTLAND O
BREWERY O
. O

They O
treated O
us O
well O
and O
the O
food B-AS
was O
extremely O
fresh O
and O
well O
- O
prepared O
. O

Their O
exotic B-AS
salad I-AS
is O
basic O
ly O
a O
delcious O
little O
green B-AS
salad I-AS
with O
a O
peanut B-AS
sauce I-AS
that O
is O
perfect O
before O

THE O
BIG O
COMPLAINT O
, O
NO O
TOASTING B-AS
AVAILABLE O
. O

Even O
if O
the O
food B-AS
was O
n't O
this O
good O
, O
the O
garden B-AS
is O
a O
great O
place B-AS
to O
sit O
outside O
and O
relax O
. O

Volare O
virgins O
or O
weekly O
regulars O
, O
everyone O
gets O
treated O
the O
same O
and O
you O
ca O
n't O
ask O
for O
more O
than O
that O
when O
the O
service B-AS
is O
this O
friendly O
. O

The O
food B-AS
came O
out O
wrong O
, O
the O
waiter B-AS
was O
no O
where O
to O
be O
found O
and O
the O
wine B-AS
showed O
up O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
meal B-AS
. O

The O
chicken B-AS
and O
steak B-AS
were O
seasoned O
and O
cooked O
to O
perfection O
, O
and O
the O
lamb B-AS
sandwhich I-AS
is O
great O
for O
heartier O
appetites O
. O

Faan O
is O
sooo O
good O
. O

We O
saw O
them O
heating O
up O
at O
least O
one O
frozen O
item O
though O
I O
' O
m O
not O
sure O
which O
dim B-AS
sum I-AS
dish I-AS
it O
was O
. O

No O
you O
're O
going O
to O
go O
back O
because O
the O
food B-AS
was O
good O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
great O
and O
the O
service B-AS
was O
even O
better O
. O

While O
this O
can O
hardly O
be O
called O
a O
restaurant O
, O
it O
is O
possibly O
the O
best O
deal O
in O
Manhatten O
, O
$ O
4 O
for O
a O
plate O
heaped O
with O
rice B-AS
and O
2 O
- O
3 O
entrees B-AS
. O

Traditional B-AS
French I-AS
decour I-AS
was O
pleasant O
though O
the O
hall B-AS
was O
rather O
noisy O
, O
the O
restaurant O
was O
full O
and O
we O
had O
to O
raise O
our O
voices O
to O
be O
able O
to O
maintain O
a O
conversation O
. O

The O
fish B-AS
is O
fresh O
and O
each O
piece O
is O
sliced O
to O
perfection O
and O
seasoned O
by O
the O
sushi B-AS
chef I-AS
usually O
with O
a O
little O
fresh O
wasabi B-AS
and O
soy B-AS
sauce I-AS
but O
also O
sometimes O
with O
some O
sea B-AS
salt I-AS
. O

Consequently O
, O
their O
burgers B-AS
fell O
apart O
in O
their O
hands O
and O
made O
such O
a O
mess O
that O
they O
did'nt O
feel O
like O
finishing O
them O
. O

My O
son O
and O
his O
girlfriend O
both O
wanted O
cheeseburgers B-AS
and O
they O
were O
huge O
! O

I O
really O
recommend O
the O
very O
simple O
Unda B-AS
( I-AS
Egg I-AS
) I-AS
rolls I-AS
. O

I O
will O
not O
be O
coming O
here O
at O
3 O
am O
again O
. O

Very O
good O
wine B-AS
choices I-AS
. O

This O
is O
the O
only O
Thai O
place O
I O
go O
too O
in O
NYC O
, O
it O
's O
wonderful O
, O
and O
live O
relaxed O
Jazz B-AS
on O
certain O
nights O
. O

We O
were O
seated O
and O
ignored O
by O
waitstaff B-AS
. O

If O
you O
are O
in O
a O
big O
group O
, O
this O
place O
is O
perfect O
because O
it O
recomends O
sharing O
, O
they O
have O
lazy B-AS
susans I-AS
on O
most O
tables B-AS
, O
even O
families O
can O
feel O
comfortable O
here O
. O

They O
showed O
up O
15 O
minutes O
after O
the O
tuna B-AS
melt O
. O

Tasty O
steak B-AS
, O
pork B-AS
loin I-AS
, O
the O
works O
. O

I O
went O
with O
5 O
friends O
and O
we O
lingered O
at O
the O
table B-AS
for O
a O
bit O
and O
did O
n't O
feel O
rushed O
at O
all O
even O
though O
there O
was O
a O
wait B-AS
. O

I O
went O
to O
Ruby O
Foos O
for O
my O
birthday O
and O
enjoyed O
our O
experience O
there O
. O

I O
'd O
highly O
recommend O
it O
for O
a O
special O
occasion O
- O
it O
provides O
and O
intimate O
setting B-AS
and O
nice O
service B-AS
. O

The O
burger B-AS
was O
great O
, O
also O
. O

they O
did O
give O
a O
15 O
% O
discount B-AS
at O
the O
end O
, O
was O
n't O
enough O
, O
as O
they O
knew O
the O
service B-AS
was O
horrible O
. O

Just O
because O
it O
's O
cheap O
does O
NOT O
mean O
the O
portions B-AS
are O
small O
or O
the O
food B-AS
is O
nasty O
, O
IT O
IS O
GREAT O
! O

The O
pizza B-AS
was O
great O
. O

And O
everytime O
I O
go O
there O
's O
a O
bunch O
of O
drunk O
idiots O
making O
a O
scene O
out O
front O
. O

I O
had O
never O
had O
Edamame B-AS
pureed I-AS
before O
but O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
innovative O
and O
tasty O
could O
' O
ve O
used O
a O
bit O
more O
salt O
. O

however O
, O
it O
's O
the O
service B-AS
that O
leaves O
a O
bad O
taste O
in O
my O
mouth O
. O

When O
we O
notified O
him O
that O
he O
did O
n't O
mention O
the O
specials B-AS
, O
he O
did O
n't O
apologize O
but O
let O
us O
know O
that O
we O
made O
a O
very O
good O
decision O
regardless O
. O

The O
price B-AS
was O
extremely O
reasonable O
for O
the O
appetizers B-AS
and O
food B-AS
we O
ate O
. O

Do O
n't O
dine O
at O
Tamarind O
for O
the O
vegetarian B-AS
dishes I-AS
, O
they O
are O
simply O
not O
up O
to O
par O
with O
the O
non B-AS
- I-AS
veg I-AS
selections I-AS
. O

Kenny O
the O
owner B-AS
is O
always O
there O
and O
he O
treats O
my O
family O
like O
we O
are O
part O
of O
his O
family O
. O

They O
need O
a O
kick O
out O
of O
it O
but O
until O
then O
the O
sushi B-AS
is O
pretty O
good O
and O
the O
place B-AS
is O
consistent O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
had O
to O
wait B-AS
only O
a O
few O
times O
during O
lunch B-AS
but O
this O
place O
is O
definitely O
worth O
the O
wait B-AS
. O

All O
in O
all O
the O
food B-AS
was O
above O
average O
and O
I O
would O
return O
to O
see O
how O
they O
operate O
with O
four O
or O
less O
dinners B-AS
. O

Judging O
from O
previous O
posts O
this O
used O
to O
be O
a O
good O
place O
, O
but O
not O
any O
longer O
. O

Delicious O
food B-AS
, O
excellent O
service B-AS
, O
and O
a O
pretty O
atmosphere B-AS
make O
this O
a O
great O
choice O
for O
dinner B-AS
and O
the O
$ O
599 O
lunch B-AS
buffet I-AS
makes O
it O
an O
even O
better O
choice O
for O
lunch B-AS
! O
. O

For O
appetizers B-AS
, O
I O
recommend O
the O
shrimp B-AS
fritters I-AS
and O
dumplings B-AS
. O

And O
cheap O
! O

Such O
nice O
people B-AS
working O
here O
, O
but O
I O
have O
to O
review O
the O
food B-AS
. O

The O
restaurant O
is O
dark O
and O
not O
very O
attractive O
and O
then O
you O
have O
spot B-AS
lights I-AS
shining O
on O
you O
putting O
you O
in O
the O
worst O
light O
possible O
, O
reaching O
for O
sunglasses O
. O

Try O
the O
Times B-AS
Square I-AS
cocktail I-AS
- O
ginger B-AS
lemonade I-AS
with I-AS
vodka I-AS
also O
available O
without O
vodka O
. O

Nice O
find O
. O

Veal B-AS
Parmigana I-AS
, O
Better O
than O
Patsy O
's O
! O

Great O
wine B-AS
, O
great O
food B-AS
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
mediocre O
, O
and O
the O
lack O
of O
air B-AS
conditioning I-AS
made O
for O
a O
less O
than O
comfortable O
meal B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
and O
staff B-AS
always O
surprise O
me O
with O
the O
new O
heights O
they O
are O
taken O
to O
. O

Amazing O
! O

Went O
to O
Ottimo O
and O
was O
expecting O
outstanding O
pizza B-AS
as O
I O
love O
La O
Pizza O
Fresca O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
always O
been O
seated O
propmtly O
. O

We O
try O
frequenting O
new O
restaurants O
all O
over O
the O
city O
, O
but O
any O
time O
that O
we O
visit O
a O
restaurant O
other O
than O
Roth O
's O
we O
are O
always O
disappointed O
. O

honestly O
the O
worst O
sushi B-AS
my O
husband O
and O
i O
had O
in O
our O
entire O
lives O
. O

There O
is O
nothing O
more O
pleasant O
than O
that O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
this O
place O
to O
anyone O
and O
would O
without O
a O
doubt O
come O
again O
. O

However O
, O
if O
you O
want O
great O
food B-AS
at O
a O
great O
price B-AS
and O
do O
n't O
mind O
the O
decor B-AS
, O
you O
ca O
n't O
beat O
this O
place O
. O

What O
makes O
this O
restaurant O
special O
are O
the O
authentic O
sichuan B-AS
cooking I-AS
and O
being O
the O
only O
one O
in O
NYC O
that O
offers O
authentic O
chongqing B-AS
hotpot I-AS
. O

Mizu O
is O
the O
Japenese O
find O
in O
Grammercy O
. O

For O
sure O
i O
will O
keep O
coming O
back O
because O
i O
feel O
really O
this O
restaurant O
deserves O
. O

Our O
tiny O
table B-AS
for O
two O
dinner B-AS
plates I-AS
hung O
over O
edge O
was O
right O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
one O
of O
the O
lanes O
of O
waiter B-AS
traffic I-AS
. O

Sake O
collection O
was O
excellent O
Try O
Nanbu B-AS
Bijin I-AS
, O
but O
pricy O
. O

Interesting O
other O
dishes B-AS
for O
a O
change O
include O
chicken B-AS
in I-AS
curry I-AS
sauc I-AS
and O
salmon B-AS
caserole I-AS
. O

One O
of O
my O
favorite O
restaurants O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
. O

One O
of O
my O
favorites O
though O
was O
the O
Angry B-AS
Lobster I-AS
, O
a O
cold B-AS
lobster I-AS
salad I-AS
that O
was O
magnificent O
. O

I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
I O
am O
pleasantly O
suprised O
and O
I O
will O
most O
likely O
stop O
in O
again O
if O
I O
am O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
. O

Ask O
for O
Usha O
, O
the O
nicest O
bartender B-AS
in O
manhattan O
. O

The O
service B-AS
is O
outstanding O
and O
my O
crab B-AS
- I-AS
cake I-AS
eggs I-AS
benedict I-AS
could O
not O
have O
been O
better O
. O

The O
place O
's O
decor B-AS
and O
hidden O
bathrooms B-AS
made O
for O
a O
good O
laugh O
. O

This O
is O
a O
true O
gem O
of O
the O
village O
. O

Its O
location B-AS
is O
good O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
Hutner O
College O
is O
near O
and O
their O
prices B-AS
are O
very O
reasonable O
, O
makes O
students O
go O
back O
to O
Suan O
again O
and O
again O
. O

However O
, O
I O
think O
Jeckll O
and O
Hydes O
t O
is O
one O
of O
those O
places O
that O
is O
fun O
to O
do O
once O
. O

They O
treat O
me O
like O
family O
, O
morning O
and O
night O
. O

A O
wonderful O
place B-AS
! O

Please O
take O
my O
advice O
, O
go O
and O
try O
this O
place O
. O

Service O
was O
on O
par O
but O
not O
wonderful O
. O

for O
my O
birthday O
and O
we O
had O
an O
excellent O
time O
. O

Deliveries B-AS
often O
take O
up O
to O
an O
hour O
and O
the O
prices B-AS
are O
higher O
than O
most O
other O
pizzerias O
in O
the O
area O
. O

I O
went O
to O
Amma O
after O
a O
friend O
recommended O
it O
. O

I O
' O
m O
just O
reading O
some O
of O
these O
reviews O
and O
its O
nonsense O
that O
people O
are O
reviewing O
some O
places O
because O
it O
was O
too O
loud O
. O

Kind O
of O
a O
small O
place B-AS
but O
I O
guess O
if O
they O
are O
not O
too O
busy O
might O
be O
able O
to O
fit O
a O
group O
or O
kids O
. O

Maybe O
tomorrow O
; O
- O

We O
also O
ordered O
two O
hot B-AS
dogs I-AS
thinking O
they O
would O
be O
pretty O
good O
since O
there O
is O
a O
whole O
section O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
devoted O
to O
them O
. O

please O
do O
n't O
fool O
us O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
had O
the O
chicken B-AS
with I-AS
garlic I-AS
sauce I-AS
, O
chicken B-AS
with I-AS
black I-AS
bean I-AS
sauce I-AS
, O
and O
hunan B-AS
chicken I-AS
. O

Because O
of O
the O
delicate O
thin O
crust B-AS
, O
take B-AS
- I-AS
out I-AS
pies I-AS
get O
soggy O
in O
their O
boxes O
. O

I O
suspect O
this O
restaurant O
is O
what O
Rao O
's O
would O
be O
if O
it O
had O
n't O
turned O
exclusive O
. O

The O
dish B-AS
had O
like O
6 O
pieces O
of O
beef B-AS
in O
it O
. O

strike O
up O
a O
conversation O
with O
the O
attorney O
next O
to O
you O
, O
or O
with O
the O
local O
union O
worker O
on O
the O
other O
side O
. O

We O
were O
then O
shooed O
inside O
. O

We O
got O
in O
line O
and O
were O
served B-AS
while O
in O
line O
a O
bannan B-AS
fritter I-AS
. O

It O
might O
have O
been O
a O
little O
too O
spicy O
for O
my O
friend O
, O
which O
you O
can O
couteract O
with O
eat O
more O
rice B-AS
and O
keeping O
water B-AS
on O
hand O
. O

This O
place B-AS
is O
always O
very O
crowded O
and O
popular O
. O

Appetizers B-AS
are O
somewhere O
around O
$ O
7 O
each O
and O
the O
main B-AS
dishes I-AS
are O
between O
$ O
11 O
and O
$ O
16 O
. O

really O
depends O
on O
your O
luck O
! O

Just O
went O
here O
for O
my O
girlfriends O
23rd O
bday O
. O

My O
wife O
and O
I O
went O
to O
Orsay O
for O
Valentine O
's O
dinner B-AS
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
about O
you O
guys O
, O
but O
when O
I O
go O
somewhere O
to O
eat O
I O
go O
for O
the O
food B-AS
not O
for O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
. O

They O
should O
have O
called O
it O
mascarpone O
with O
chocolate O
chips O
- O
good O
but O
a O
far O
cry O
from O
what O
the O
name O
implies O
. O

A O
gentleman O
, O
maybe O
the O
manager B-AS
, O
came O
to O
our O
table B-AS
, O
and O
without O
so O
much O
as O
a O
smile O
or O
greeting O
asked O
for O
our O
order O
. O

Very O
different O
than O
regular O
dimsum O
places O
. O

I O
have O
lived O
in O
NY O
for O
many O
years O
and O
have O
dined O
at O
many O
restaraunts O
. O

When O
you O
enter O
, O
you O
feel O
like O
you O
have O
entered O
your O
mom O
's O
kitchen O
. O

we O
were O
tired O
and O
cold O
when O
we O
got O
to O
the O
restaurant O
, O
then O
we O
sat O
down O
to O
begin O
ordering O
appetizers B-AS
. O

I O
' O
ve O
had O
pizza B-AS
both O
times O
and O
the O
caprese B-AS
salad I-AS
appetizer I-AS
. O

She O
lives O
nearby O
but O
had O
never O
gone O
to O
this O
establishment O
thinking O
that O
it O
might O
be O
too O
touristy O
. O

He O
was O
terribly O
thirsty O
after O
the O
meal B-AS
too O
. O

And O
when O
I O
visit O
her O
I O
make O
it O
a O
point O
to O
eat O
at O
Ino O
at O
least O
once O
daily O
if O
not O
once O
for O
the O
whole O
trip O
. O

I O
was O
n't O
there O
for O
the O
Half B-AS
- I-AS
Price I-AS
Saturday I-AS
Night I-AS
Special I-AS
, O
but O
Tuesday O
Night O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
it O
appears O
he O
is O
going O
to O
go O
postal O
at O
any O
moment O
. O

There O
was O
a O
small O
group O
of O
us O
looking O
somewhere O
to O
eat O
kinda O
late O
on O
a O
weeknight O
and O
we O
ended O
up O
at O
Pastis O
. O

for O
Meetball O
Night O
. O

If O
you O
like O
the O
food B-AS
and O
the O
value B-AS
you O
get O
from O
some O
of O
Chinatown O
restaurants O
, O
this O
is O
not O
the O
place O
for O
you O
. O

They O
are O
opening O
two O
more O
places O
as O
i O
saw O
a O
flyer O
there O
one O
in O
Yonkers O
which O
is O
a O
restraunt O
and O
banquet O
hall O
and O
another O
one O
in O
parsipanny O
new O
jersey O
. O

Want O
to O
impress O
? O

The O
selection B-AS
changes O
frequently O
but O
the O
basic B-AS
dishes I-AS
are O
always O
available O
. O

We O
' O
ve O
lived O
in O
the O
area O
for O
more O
than O
8 O
years O
. O

Get O
the O
soup B-AS
and O
a O
nosh B-AS
( I-AS
pastrami I-AS
sandwich I-AS
) I-AS
for O
$ O
8 O
and O
you O
're O
golden O
. O

I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
if O
this O
what O
makes O
it O
easier O
to O
get O
a O
saet O
a O
lunch B-AS
I O
do O
n't O
mind O
. O

My O
family O
and O
I O
ate O
here O
last O
night O
for O
our O
annual O
Christmas B-AS
dinner I-AS
with O
the O
family O
members O
who O
would O
rather O
spend O
the O
holidays O
with O
friends O
out O
- O
of O
- O
town O
. O

I O
grew O
up O
on O
these O
bagels B-AS
. O

We O
were O
told O
that O
they O
were O
booked O
solid O
and O
no O
other O
table B-AS
was O
available O
. O

The O
restaraurant O
is O
very O
small O
so O
reservations B-AS
are O
a O
must O
. O

Visited O
there O
while O
on O
vacation O
and O
reading O
the O
reviews O
. O

A O
one O
women O
show O
! O

You O
ca O
n't O
go O
wrong O
here O
. O

At O
first O
i O
was O
rolling O
my O
ideas O
of O
yet O
another O
French O
place O
on O
the O
UES O
. O

To O
my O
right O
, O
the O
hostess B-AS
stood O
over O
a O
busboy B-AS
and O
hissed O
rapido O
, O
rapido O
as O
he O
tried O
to O
clear O
and O
re O
- O
set O
a O
table B-AS
for O
six O
. O

In O
China O
the O
phrase O
for O
a O
good O
restaurant O
is O
hot O
and O
loud O
. O

After O
dealing O
with O
subpar O
pizza B-AS
all O
over O
the O
Kensington O
neighborhood O
, O
I O
' O
ve O
found O
little O
toninos O
. O

I O
thought O
this O
place O
was O
totally O
overrated O
. O

then O
we O
ordered O
a O
dinosaur B-AS
rolls I-AS
and O
white B-AS
tuna I-AS
sashimi I-AS
. O

You O
wo O
n't O
find O
that O
anywhere O
in O
Manhattan O
. O

How O
do O
you O
rate O
home O
? O

I O
went O
here O
in O
the O
afternoon O
with O
a O
friend O
. O

Our O
first O
greeting O
when O
we O
entered O
was O
The O
last O
call O
is O
at O
10 O
, O
15 O
. O

Interior O
was O
so O
so O
. O

I O
' O
m O
partial O
to O
the O
Gnocchi B-AS
. O

I O
guess O
the O
way O
my O
friends O
and O
I O
described O
it O
was O
The O
French O
Colonies O
. O

they O
were O
able O
to O
squeeze O
me O
in O
at O
6 O
after O
i O
called O
the O
night O
before O
my O
anniversary O
for O
a O
friday O
night O
reservation B-AS
and O
told O
me O
they O
'd O
treat O
us O
well O
for O
the O
occasion O
. O

Boy O
was O
I O
wrong O
! O

I O
visit O
New O
Green O
Bo O
when O
I O
have O
money O
or O
when O
I O
am O
broke O
. O

Note O
that O
they O
do O
not O
serve O
beer B-AS
, O
you O
must O
bring O
your O
own O
. O

We O
ate O
outside O
at O
Haru O
's O
Sake O
bar B-AS
because O
Haru O
's O
restaurant O
next O
door O
was O
overflowing O
. O

When O
we O
walked O
in O
it O
seemed O
like O
it O
was O
there O
for O
200 O
years O
. O

Ahhh O
. O

Better O
than O
the O
bagel O
shop O
on O
the O
corner O
, O
but O
not O
worth O
going O
out O
of O
your O
way O
for O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
. O

it O
helps O
if O
you O
know O
what O
to O
order O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
typical O
short O
- O
order O
, O
dinner O
type O
. O

We O
shared O
a O
bottle B-AS
of I-AS
sake I-AS
, O
an O
order O
of O
edamames B-AS
, O
and O
she O
had O
the O
sushi B-AS
plate I-AS
while O
I O
had O
the O
sashimi B-AS
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
believe O
people O
complain O
about O
no O
cheese B-AS
sticks I-AS
? O

But O
that O
is O
highly O
forgivable O
. O

From O
the O
appetizers B-AS
we O
ate O
, O
the O
dim B-AS
sum I-AS
and O
other O
variety O
of O
foods B-AS
, O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
criticize O
the O
food B-AS
. O

When O
we O
arrived O
at O
6 O
, O
00 O
PM O
, O
the O
restaurant O
was O
practically O
empty O
. O

Each O
table B-AS
has O
a O
pot B-AS
of I-AS
boiling I-AS
water I-AS
sunken O
into O
its O
surface O
, O
and O
you O
get O
platters O
of O
thin O
sliced O
meats B-AS
, O
various O
vegeASPECT0s O
, O
and O
rice B-AS
and O
glass B-AS
noodles I-AS
. O

I O
am O
going O
to O
the O
mid O
town O
location O
next O
. O

Chow B-AS
fun I-AS
was O
dry O
; O
pork B-AS
shu I-AS
mai I-AS
was O
more O
than O
usually O
greasy O
and O
had O
to O
share O
a O
table O
with O
loud O
and O
rude O
family O
. O

I O
/ O
we O
will O
never O
go O
back O
to O
this O
place B-AS
again O
. O

I O
had O
my O
eyes O
on O
this O
place O
, O
promising O
myself O
I O
will O
one O
day O
give O
it O
a O
try O
' O
. O

And O
I O
hate O
to O
say O
this O
but O
I O
doubt O
I O
'll O
ever O
go O
back O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
very O
averagethe O
Thai B-AS
fusion I-AS
stuff I-AS
is O
a O
bit O
too O
sweet O
, O
every O
thing O
they O
serve O
is O
too O
sweet O
here O
. O

The O
decor B-AS
is O
night O
thobut O
they O
REALLY O
need O
to O
clean O
that O
vent B-AS
in O
the O
ceilingits O
quite O
un O
- O
appetizing O
, O
and O
kills O
your O
effort O
to O
make O
this O
place B-AS
look O
sleek O
and O
modern O
. O

i O
hang O
out O
, O
and O
live O
, O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
. O

the O
food B-AS
is O
decent O
. O

i O
happen O
to O
have O
a O
policy O
that O
goes O
along O
with O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
self O
- O
respect O
, O
which O
includes O
not O
letting O
a O
waiter B-AS
intimidate O
me O
, O
ie O
make O
me O
feel O
bad O
asking O
for O
trivialities O
like O
water O
, O
or O
the O
check O
. O

well O
, O
i O
did O
n't O
find O
it O
there O
, O
and O
trust O
, O
i O
have O
told O
everyone O
i O
can O
think O
of O
about O
my O
experience O
. O

the O
last O
time O
i O
walked O
by O
it O
looked O
pretty O
empty O
hmmm O
. O

Quite O
simply O
it O
's O
like O
stepping O
out O
of O
Manhattan O
and O
into O
a O
haven O
of O
tranquility O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
average O
to O
above O
- O
average O
; O
the O
French B-AS
Onion I-AS
soup I-AS
filling O
yet O
not O
overly O
impressive O
, O
and O
the O
desserts B-AS
not O
brilliant O
in O
any O
way O
. O

The O
combination O
of O
super O
- O
fresh O
ingredients B-AS
in O
the O
dishes O
are O
unusual O
but O
really O
delicious O
. O

Sit O
outside O
in O
the O
warm O
weather O
; O
inside O
for O
cozy O
winter O
. O

Very O
cozy O
and O
warm O
inside O
. O

I O
will O
be O
back O
! O

I O
' O
m O
not O
sure O
where O
the O
other O
reviewers O
ate O
but O
it O
seems O
as O
if O
we O
visited O
two O
different O
restaurants O
because O
my O
friends O
and O
I O
all O
enjoy O
Mizu B-AS
very O
much O
and O
we O
're O
repeat O
customers O
. O

Tiny O
dessert B-AS
was O
$ O
800just O
plain O
overpriced O
for O
what O
it O
is O
. O

Try O
their O
chef B-AS
's I-AS
specials I-AS
they O
are O
to O
die O
for O
. O

The O
waitress B-AS
moved O
our O
table O
practically O
into O
the O
bathroom O
and O
when O
we O
asked O
to O
cancel O
our O
dinner O
orders O
because O
we O
did O
not O
want O
to O
eat O
sitting O
on O
the O
toilet O
, O
we O
were O
told O
no O
. O

Then O
, O
to O
top O
things O
off O
, O
she O
dropped O
used O
silverware O
on O
my O
boyfriend O
's O
jacket O
and O
did O
not O
stop O
to O
apologize O
or O
clean O
the O
mess O
that O
was O
left O
on O
clothes O
. O

Such O
a O
disappointment O
. O

Rude O
service B-AS
, O
medicore O
food B-AS
are O
tons O
of O
restaurants O
in O
NYstay O
away O
from O
this O
one O
. O

Two O
complaints O
their O
appetizer B-AS
selection I-AS
stinks O
, O
it O
would O
be O
nice O
to O
get O
some O
mozzarella O
sticks O
on O
the O
menu O
. O

I O
stumbled O
upon O
this O
second O
floor O
walk O
- O
up O
two O
Fridays O
ago O
when O
I O
was O
with O
two O
friends O
in O
town O
from O
LA O
. O

Being O
serious O
sushi O
lovers O
, O
we O
sat O
at O
the O
sushi O
bar O
to O
be O
closer O
to O
the O
action O
. O

I O
asked O
the O
chef O
what O
he O
recommends O
and O
he O
asked O
me O
if O
I O
like O
Uni O
. O

For O
those O
of O
you O
who O
do O
n't O
know O
, O
Uni O
is O
Sea O
Urchin O
in O
Japanese O
, O
which O
happens O
to O
be O
my O
favorite O
. O

He O
served O
me O

which O
I O
never O
had O
before O

and O
let O
me O
tell O
youIT O
WAS O
HEAVEN O
! O
. O

To O
sum O
it O
up O
, O
Service B-AS
varies O
from O
good O
to O
mediorce O
, O
depending O
on O
which O
waiter O
you O
get O
; O
generally O
it O
is O
just O
average O
Ok O
. O

Seating B-AS
is O
always O
prompt O
, O
though O
the O
restaurant O
does O
fill O
up O
in O
the O
evening O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
never O
ordered O
anything O
else O
from O
their O
menuthere O
's O
no O
need O
to O
. O

The O
restaurant B-AS
is O
cute O
but O
not O
upscale O
. O

I O
have O
to O
highly O
recommend O
the O
lobster B-AS
roll I-AS
, O
not O
to O
much O
mayo O
; O
you O
can O
tell O
it O
was O
a O
fresh O
lobster B-AS
. O

All O
the O
staff B-AS
is O
absolutely O
professional O
! O
! O

I O
sometimes O
see O
the O
waiters O
do O
n't O
have O
enough O
knowledge O
of O
their O
dishes O
. O

that O
is O
A O
MUST O
, O
but O
not O
every O
restaurant O
can O
do O
. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
dine O
with O
large O
party O
, O
I O
recommend O
to O
make O
reservation O
BASEMENT O
. O

It O
's O
boring O
on O
the O
inside O
, O
and O
our O
sushi B-AS
was O
pretty O
below O
average O
the O
tuna B-AS
was O
soggy O
and O
the O
other O
rolls B-AS
had O
no O
flavor O
. O

fresh B-AS
restaurant I-AS
was O
amazing O
food B-AS
was O
delicious O
and O
of O

fresh O
. O

the O
salads B-AS
are O
delicious O
, O
both O
refreshing O
and O
very O
spicy O
. O

I O
have O
reservations O
about O
the O
all B-AS
you I-AS
can I-AS
eat I-AS
deal I-AS
, O
however O
- O
the O
choices O
are O
fairly O
limited O
and O
you O
can O
probably O
order O
more O
food O
than O
you O
can O
eat O
for O
less O
than O
$ O
18 O
by O
just O
going O
off O
the O
menu O
. O

Enjoyed O
a O
very O
nice O
Caesar B-AS
Salad I-AS
while O
my O
wife O
had O

on O
a O
snowy O
night O
to O
enjoy O
it O

I O
was O

Somehow O
working O
the O
italian O
charm O
with O
constant O
mille O

does O
not O
constitute O
proper O
service B-AS
. O

Not O

was O
just O
enough O
. O

We O
had O
Lava O
Cake O

ordered O
when O
our O

came O
it O
takes O
at O

. O

When O
you O
add O
it O
all O
together O
, O
it O
just O
does O
n't O
seem O
worth O
it O
to O
meespecially O
considering O
the O
prices O
. O

This O
restaurant O
was O
recommended O
by O
a O
localas O

This O

is O
pricey O
, O
and O
yes O
, O
the O
food B-AS
is O
worth O
it O
; O
but O
the O
service B-AS
makes O
you O
feel O
like O
you O
should O
be O
paying O
a O
quater O
of O
the O
price O
. O

As O
a O
student O
in O
NYU O
i O
need O
a O
place O
to O

the O
past O
2 O
yrs O
and O
finally O
decided O
to O

here O
. O

10 O

not O

why O
this O
restaurant B-AS
would O
be O
rated O

highly O
. O

all B-AS

- O
fresh O
ingredients B-AS
, O
thinly O

the O
only O
things O
u O
could O
really O
taste O
are O
the O
very O
salty O
soy B-AS
sauce I-AS
even O
its O
low O
sodium O
, O
the O
vinegar O

soaked O
rice B-AS
, O
and O
the O
scallion O
on O
top O
of O
the O

. O

the O
waitstaffs B-AS
are O
nice O
though O
. O

It O
's O
popular O
w O
/ O
the O
late O
crowd O
. O

This O
restaurant O
is O
VEGETARIAN O
; O
there O
are O
NO O
MEAT B-AS

whatsoever O
. O

Why O
? O

The O
asparagus B-AS
, I-AS

, I-AS
parmesan I-AS
bruschetta I-AS
is O

Wine B-AS
list I-AS

After O
dinner O
the O
manager B-AS
grabbed O
my O
boyfriend O
, O
asked O
him O
, O
Where O
are O
you O
frommaybe O
you O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
things O
work O
in O
Americaand O
in O
the O
end O
stormed O
away O
almost O
teareyed O
yelling O
that O
tips O
are O
the O
only O
thing O
they O
survive O
on O
. O

We O
did O
tip O
, O
I O
guess O
the O
model O
/ O
ASPECT0 O
just O
wanted O
more O
and O
complained O
to O
the O
manager O
. O

When O
asked O
about O
how O
a O
certain O
dish O
was O
prepared O
in O
comparison O
to O
a O
similar O
at O
other O
thai O
restaurants O
, O
he O
replied O
this O
is O
not O
Mcdonald O
's O
, O
every O
place O
makes O
things O
differently O

While O
it O
is O
understandable O
that O
every O
place O
is O
indeed O
different O
, O
there O
was O
not O
a O
need O
to O
be O
uncourteous O
to O
customers O
and O
downright O
rude O
. O

Everything O
was O
wonderful O
; O
food B-AS
, O
drinks B-AS
, O
staff B-AS
, O
mileau B-AS
. O

Considering O
we O
were O
the O
last O
patrons O
there O
and O
it O
was O
after O
the O
closing O
time O
, O
the O
waitstaff B-AS
did O
not O
rush O
us O
at O
all O
and O
made O
us O
feel O
comfortable O
and O
relaxed O
. O

My O
friends O
settled O
for O
rice O
dishes O
, O
but O
we O
came O
back O
the O
following O
day O
to O
try O
the O
dim B-AS
sum I-AS
, O
which O
was O
goodnot O
outstanding O
, O
but O
good O
. O

It O
was O
$ O
14 O
not O
really O
bad O
for O
a O
pound O
of O
Pastrami O
- O
but O
it O
did O
n't O
have O
much O
taste O
- O
I O
' O
ve O
had O
better O
for O
less O
elsewhere O
! O

We O
waited O
at O
the O
bar O
and O
had O
martinis B-AS
that O
were O
just O
right O
. O

Went O
to O
Cafe O
Spice O
with O
4 O
of O
my O
friends O
on O
a O
saturday O
night O
. O

We O
were O
greeted O
promptly O
by O
the O
waiter B-AS
who O
was O
very O
nice O
and O
cordial O
. O

She O
was O
very O
helpful O
in O
suggesting O
us O
drinks O
and O
helped O
us O
in O
ordering O
a O
lot O
of O
good O
dishes B-AS
since O
we O
knew O
nothing O
about O
Indian O
food O
. O

We O
arrived O
on O
time O
for O
our O
reservation O
and O
seated O
promptly O
. O

The O
menu B-AS
has O
so O
many O
fish O
items O
and O
oysters O
. O

We O
all O
ordered O
different O
entrees O
so O
we O
could O
share O
. O

The O
fish B-AS
was O
really O
, O
really O
fresh O
. O

I O
lived O
in O
Maine O
for O
ten O
years O
and O
grew O
up O
on O
fish O
. O

We O
all O
agreed O
that O
mare B-AS
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
seafood O
restaurants O
in O
New O
York O
. O

While O
their O
kitchen B-AS
food I-AS
is O
delicious O
, O
their O
Sushi B-AS
is O
out O
of O
this O
world O
. O

I O
expected O
quite O
a O
bit O
more O
from O
such O
an O
expensive O
menu B-AS
. O

Authentic O
Taiwanese B-AS
food I-AS
that O
's O
cheap O
what O
more O
could O
you O
ask O
for O
? O
. O

My O
friend O
devoured O
her O
chicken B-AS
and I-AS
mashed I-AS
potatos I-AS
. O

This O
is O
a O
nice O
pizza B-AS
place I-AS
with O
good O
selection B-AS
of I-AS
thin I-AS
crust I-AS
pizza I-AS
including O
the O
Basil B-AS
slice I-AS
. O

Calling O
the O
place B-AS
Hampton O
Chutney O
Co O
does O
warn O
you O
that O
these O
folks O
offer O
more O
style O
than O
substance O
, O
but O
in O
this O
unattractive O
room B-AS
with O
unhelpful O
clerks B-AS
there O
was O
a O
dearth O
of O
the O
former O
too O
. O

I O
will O
be O
out O
with O
friends O
and O
all O
of O
a O
sudden O
I O
am O
hungry O
and O
I O
only O
crave O
one O
thing O
their O
Pizza B-AS
. O

Be O
sure O
not O
to O
get O
anything O
other O
than O
bagels B-AS
! O
. O

the O
turkey B-AS
burgers I-AS
are O
scary O
! O

Try O
the O
Pad B-AS
Thai I-AS
, O
or O
sample O
anything O
on O
the O
appetizer B-AS
menu I-AS
're O
all O
delicious O
. O

I O
did O
not O
try O
the O
caviar O
but O
I O
tried O
their O
salmon B-AS
and O
crab B-AS
salad I-AS
they O
are O
all O
good O

It O
is O
definitely O
a O
good O
spot B-AS
for O
snacks O
and O
chat O
. O

You O
can O
get O
a O
completely O
delish O
martini B-AS
in O
a O
glass O
that O
's O
about O
2 O
1/2 O
drinks O
for O
$ O
850 O
I O
recommend O
the O
Vanilla B-AS

over I-AS

, O
it O
's O
wonderful O
! O

These O
are O
overpriced O

just O
around O

The O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
is O
very O
courteous O
and O
accomodating O
. O

The O
space B-AS
is O
limited O
so O
be O
prepared O
to O
wait O
up O
to O
45 O
minutes O
, O
1 O

, O
but O
be O
richly O

its O
alright O

i O
m O
not O
necessarily O
fanatical O
about O
this O
place B-AS
, O
but O
it O
was O
a O
fun O
time O
for O
low O
pirces O
. O

lobster B-AS
was O
good O
, O
nothing O
spectacular O
. O

its O
just O
a O
fun O
place O
to O
go O
, O
not O
a O
five O
star O
restaraunt B-AS
. O

Way O
below O
average O

I O
think O
the O
pizza B-AS
is O
so O
overrated O
and O
was O
under O
cooked O
. O

Had O
no O
flavor O
and O
the O
staff B-AS
is O
rude O
and O
not O
attentive O
. O

Would O
NEVER O
go O
back O

I O
love O
this O
place B-AS

I O
was O
n't O
here O
for O
the O
pizza O
so O
I O
ca O
n't O
comment O
on O
that O
yet O
but O
what O
I O
had O
was O
very O
good O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
quick O
and O
friendly O
. O

Everyone O
was O
smiling O
so O
that O
made O
me O
feel O
welcome O
. O

I O
thought O
the O
restaurant B-AS
was O
nice O
and O
clean O
. O

I O
ordered O
the O
vitello B-AS
alla I-AS
marsala I-AS
and O
I O
was O
pretty O
impressed O
. O

The O
veal B-AS
and O
the O
mushrooms B-AS
were O
cooked O
perfectly O
. O

The O
potato B-AS
balls I-AS
were O
not O
dry O
at O
all O
in O
fact O
it O
was O
buttery O
. O

The O
only O
downside O
they O
only O
take O
cash O
which O
is O
OK O
if O
you O
know O
about O
it O
ahead O
of O
time O
. O

I O
'll O
be O
back O
for O
sure O

Gross O
food B-AS
, O
Wow- O

I O
ca O
n't O
remember O
the O
last O
time O
I O
had O
such O
gross O
food B-AS
in O
New O
York O
. O

My O
quesadilla B-AS
tasted O
like O
it O
had O
been O
made O
by O
a O
three O
- O
year O
old O
with O
no O
sense O
of O
proportion O
or O
flavor O
. O

n't O
get O
me O
started O
on O
the O

, O
either O
. O

Mine O
tasted O
like O
the O
bartender O
had O
forgotten O
to O
add O
the O
tequila O
. O

Really O
, O
I O
find O
it O
rather O
scandalous O
that O
such O
a O
crappy O
restaurant O
attracts O
such O
crowds O
-- O
this O
, O
in O
the O
city O
of O
a O
million O
restaurants O
, O
at O
least O
9/10 O
of O
which O
are O
way O
better O
than O
this O
one O

Save O
your O
money O
and O
your O
time O
and O
go O
somewhere O
else O
. O

Oh O
, O
and O
I O
never O
write O
reviews O
-- O
I O
just O
was O
so O
moved O
by O
how O
bad O
this O
place B-AS
was O
, O
I O
felt O
it O
was O
my O
duty O
to O
spread O
the O
word O

Raymond B-AS

The O
omlette B-AS

Best O
Indian B-AS
Restaurant I-AS
in O
the O
City O

Decor B-AS
needs O
to O
be O
upgraded O
but O
the O
food B-AS
is O
amazing O
! O

This O
small O
Astoria O
souvlaki O
spot O
makes O
what O
many O
consider O
the O
best O
gyros B-AS
in O
New O
York O
. O

Small O
, O
bright O
, O
and O
clean O
, O
BZ O
Grill O
stands O
apart O
from O
the O
usual O
run O
of O
gyro O
joints O
, O
both O
in O
Astoria O
and O
out O
. O

What O
really O
makes O
it O
shine O
is O
the O
food B-AS
, O
which O
is O
aggressively O
seasoned O
with O
Cyrpriot O
spices O
, O
and O
all O
made O
in O
- O
house O
even O
the O
gyro B-AS
meat I-AS
and O
sausages B-AS
, O
and O
made O
of O
much O
higher O
quality O
ingredients B-AS
that O
might O
otherwise O
be O
expected O
. O

All O
the O
various O
Greek B-AS
and I-AS
Cypriot I-AS
dishes I-AS
are O
excellent O
, O
but O
the O
gyro B-AS
is O
the O
reason O
to O
come O
-- O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
eat O
one O
your O
trip O
was O
wasted O
. O

The O
high O

The O

The O

Good O
Experience O

During O
our O
trip O
to O
NYC O
, O
we O
made O
reservations O
to O
dine O
in O
the O
pool O
room O
of O
the O
Four O
Seasons O
for O
their O
pre O
- O
theater O
menu O
offering O
a O
modified O
menu O
for O
$ O
65 O
pp O
. O

The O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
was O
extensive O
, O
though O
the O
staff B-AS
did O
not O
seem O
knowledgeable O
about O
wine O
pairings O
. O

The O
bread B-AS
we O
received O
was O
horrible O
, O
rock O
hard O
and O
cold O
, O
and O
the O
free O
appetizer B-AS
of I-AS
olives I-AS
was O
disappointing O
. O

However O
, O
our O
main B-AS
course I-AS
was O
wonderful O
. O

I O
had O
fish B-AS
and O
my O
husband O
had O
the O
filet B-AS
, O
both O
of O
which O
exceeded O
our O
expectations O
. O

The O
dessert O
we O
had O
a O
pear B-AS
torte I-AS
was O
good O
, O
but O
, O
once O
again O
, O
the O
staff B-AS
was O
unable O
to O
provide O
appropriate O
drink O
suggestions O
. O

When O
we O
inquired O
about O
ports O
, O
the O
waitress B-AS
listed O
off O
several O
but O
did O
not O
know O
taste O
variations O
or O
cost O
. O

Not O
what O
I O
would O
expect O
for O
the O
price O
and O
prestige O
of O
this O
location B-AS
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
I O
would O
return O
, O
as O
it O
was O
a O
beautiful O
restaurant B-AS
, O
but O
I O
hope O
the O
staff B-AS
pays O
more O
attention O
to O
the O
little O
details O
in O
the O
future O
. O

short O
and O
sweet O
, O
seating B-AS
is O
great O
, O
it O
's O
romantic O
, O
cozy O
and O
private O
. O

The O
boths B-AS
are O
not O
as O
small O
as O
some O
of O
the O
reviews O
make O
them O
out O
to O
look O
they O
're O
perfect O
for O
2 O
people O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
extremely O
fast O
and O
attentivethanks O
to O
the O
service B-AS
button O
on O
your O
table O
but O
I O
barely O
understood O
1 O
word O
when O
the O
waiter B-AS
took O
our O
order O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
ok O
and O
fair O
nothing O
to O
go O
crazy O
. O

over O
. O

Over O
all O
the O
looks B-AS
of O
the O
place O
exceeds O
the O
actual O
meals B-AS
. O

So O
what O
you O
really O
end O
up O
paying O
for O
is O
the O
restaurant B-AS
not O
the O
food B-AS
. O

Will O
prob O
not O
return O
but O
it O
is O
a O
great O
dinning O
experience O
to O
try O
atleast O
once O
. O

Impressed O
. O

Subtle O
food B-AS
and O
service B-AS

Noodle O
pudding O
is O
exactly O
the O
type O
of O
service B-AS
and O
food B-AS
I O
enjoy O
. O

Servers O
are O
all O
different O
, O
Greg B-AS
is O
my O
favorite O
. O

Sometimes O
tables O
do O
n't O
understand O
his O
sense O
of O
humor O
but O
it O
's O
refreshing O
to O
have O
a O
server B-AS
who O
has O
personality O
, O
professionalism O
, O
and O
respects O
the O
privacy O
of O
your O
dinner O
. O

This O
is O
the O
first O
place O
I O
' O
ve O
been O
that O
a O
runner B-AS
remembers O
my O
order O
hope O
he O
likes O
his O
job O
because O
I O
have O
half O
a O
mind O
to O
steal O
him O
for O
my O
restaurant O
. O

Prices O
are O
fair O
across O
the O
board O
for O
both O
food B-AS
and O
bev B-AS
. O

I O
go O
out O
to O
eat O
and O
like O
my O
courses O
, O
servers B-AS
are O
patient O
and O
never O
rush O
courses O
or O
force O
another O
drink O
. O

La I-AS
Femme I-AS
last O
night O
was O
a O
true O
experience O
unlike O
any O
other O
in O
New O

! O

Highly O
impressed O
from O
the O

the O

to O
the O

to O
the O
great O
night O
I O

Food B-AS
took O
some O
time O
to O
prepare O
, O
all O
worth O
waiting O
for O
. O

We O
were O
drawn O
into O
the O
belly B-AS
dancing I-AS
show I-AS
that O
captivated O
the O
crowd O
. O

I O
never O
write O
on O
these O
sites O
but O
this O
restaurant B-AS
is O
def O
worth O
commending O
! O

Great O
find O
in O
the O
West O
Village O
! O

Maggot O
in O
the O
food B-AS
! O

I O
' O
ve O
been O
wanting O
to O
go O
to O
this O
place O
forever O
and O
finally O
got O
a O
table O
. O

The O
menu B-AS
looked O
great O
, O
and O
the O
waiter B-AS
was O
very O
nice O
, O
but O
when O
the O
food B-AS
came O
, O
it O
was O
average O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
I O
finished O
my O
plate O
, O
and O
that O
's O
when O
I O
found O
a O
maggot O
in O
mushroom B-AS
sauce I-AS
at O
the O
bottom O
. O

I O
showed O
it O
to O
the O
manager B-AS
, O
and O
he O
smilingly O
apologized O
and O
brought O
us O
two O
free O
desserts O
but O
did O
not O
ask O
us O
what O
we O
wanted O
and O
so O
brought O
the O
last O
two O
desserts O
we O
would O
have O
asked O
for O
. O

When O
the O
bill O
came O
, O
nothing O
was O
comped O
, O
so O
I O
told O
the O
manager O
very O
politely O
that O
we O
were O
willing O
to O
pay O
for O
the O
wine O
, O
but O
I O
did O
n't O
think O
I O
should O
have O
to O
pay O
for O
food O
with O
a O
maggot O
in O
it O
. O

Yes O
, O
I O
ate O
the O
food O
, O
but O
I O
certainly O
would O
not O
have O
if O
I O
had O
seen O
the O
maggot O
before O
eating O
, O
and O
I O
was O
at O
this O
point O
fairly O
sick O
to O
my O
stomach O
. O

The O
manager B-AS
finally O
said O
he O
would O
comp O
the O
two O
glasses O
of O
wine O
which O
cost O
less O
than O
the O
food O
, O
and O
made O
it O
seem O
like O
a O
big O
concession O
. O

We O
paid O
and O
left O
because O
we O
did O
n't O
feel O
like O
arguing O
any O
more O
. O

I O
have O
worked O
in O
restaurants O
and O
cook O
a O
lot O
, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
way O
a O
maggot O
should O
be O
able O
to O
get O
into O
well O
prepared O
food B-AS
. O

For O
a O
restaurant B-AS
with O
such O
a O
good O
reputation O
and O
that O
is O
usually O
so O
packed O
, O
there O
was O
no O
reason O
for O
such O
a O
lack O
of O
intelligent O
customer B-AS
service I-AS
. O

A O
fairly O
late O
entry O
into O

even O
the O

it O
's O
pretty O
good O

albeit O
with O
a O
somewhat O
dismal O
setting O

Unhygienic O

, O
which O
it O
tries O
to O
make O
up O
for O
with O
a O
crazy O
scheme B-AS
of I-AS
mirrors I-AS
. O

If O
you O
're O
into O
being O
lost O
when O
you O
're O
just O
five O
feet O
from O
your O
table O
then O
hey O
, O
that O
's O
a O
good O
thing O
. O

Despite O
the O
confusing O
mirrors B-AS
this O
will O
likely O
be O
my O
go O
- O
to O
for O
modern B-AS
Japanese I-AS
food I-AS
for O
the O
foreseeable O
future O
. O

Another O
review O
here O
claimed O
the O
pre O
- O
fix O
was O
$ O
29 O

but O
it O
is O
$ O
55 O
per O

not O

Indo B-AS
Chinese I-AS
food I-AS
, O
pretty O
good O
. O

Not O
a O
very O
fancy O
place B-AS
but O
very O
good O
Chinese B-AS
style I-AS
Indian I-AS
food I-AS
. O

The O
chicken B-AS
lollipop I-AS
is O
my O
favorite O
, O
most O
of O
the O
dishes B-AS
I O
have O
to O
agree O
with O
a O
previous O
reviewer O
are O
quite O
oily O
and O
very O
spicy O
, O
espeically O
the O
Chilli B-AS
Chicken I-AS
. O

My O
mom O
originally O
introduced O
me O
to O
this O
place O
, O
but O
even O
she O
being O
Indian O
feels O
the O
food B-AS
can O
be O
somewhat O
over O
the O
top O
spicy O
and O
far O
too O
oily O
. O

Still O
we O
keep O
going O
back O
, O

I O
was O
speechless O
by O
the O
horrible O
food B-AS
. O

I O
attended O
a O
holiday O
dinner O
at O
the O
restaurant O
, O
and O
the O
food B-AS
was O
majorly O
disappointing O
. O

Rather O
than O
eating O
the O
meat O
entree O
being O
offered O
, O
I O
requested O
a O
vegetarian O
dish O
. O

Rather O
than O
preparing O
vegetarian B-AS
dish I-AS
, O
the O
chef B-AS
presented O
me O
with O
a O
plate O
of O
steamed O
vegetables O
minus O
sauce O
, O
seasoning O
, O
or O
any O
form O
or O
aesthetic O
presentation O
. O

I O
was O
so O
stunned O
, O
and O
I O
left O
the O
dinner O
hungry O
and O
majorly O
disappointing O
. O

This O
place B-AS
survives O
on O
reputation O
alone O
. O

I O
will O
NEVER O
return O
. O

Also O
, O
they O

I O
have O
been O
living O
in O
NYC O
for O
bit O
now O
and O
I O
have O
to O
say O
I O
love O
to O
go O
out O
and O
explore O
the O
scene O
. O

I O
came O
across O
Village B-AS
Underground I-AS
by O
accident O
, O
now O
I O
go O
there O
all O
the O
time O
. O

The O
martinis B-AS
are O
amazing O
and O
very O
fairly O
priced O
. O

THE O
SERVICE B-AS
IS O
AMAZING O
, O
i O
' O
ve O
had O
different O
waiters B-AS
and O
they O
were O
all O
nice O
, O
which O
is O
a O
rare O
thing O
in O
NYC O
. O

The O
DJ B-AS
is O
awesome O
, O
I O
have O
been O
there O
for O
my O
birthday O
and O
a O
bunch O
of O
other O
times O
with O
friends O
and O
I O
keep O
going O
back O
. O

You O
can O
get O
a O
table O
without O
a O
reservation O
if O
you O
get O
there O
early O
I O
they O
do O
n't O
make O
you O
by O
bottles O
. O

Which O
lets O
face O
itat O
times O
it O
's O
a O
good O
thing O
. O

In O
the O
end O
you O
end O
up O
with O
a O
fair O
tab O
and O
NOTHING O
BUT O
A O
GREAT O
TIME O
! O

! O

One O
of O
the O
best O
, O
if O
not O
THE O
best O
, O
restaurants O
in O
Park O
Slope O
and O
NY O
in O
general O

Everything O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
is O
great O
. O

This O
establishment B-AS
is O
the O
real O
deal O
. O

Wish O
NY O
had O
more O
of O
these O
kind O
of O
places O
, O
intimate O
, O
superb O
food B-AS
, O
homey O
, O
top O
notch O
all O
the O
way O
around O
, O
certainly O
worth O
the O
wait O
. O

There O
is O
Expensive O
- O
but O
- O
worth O
- O
it O
and O
there O
is O
Expensive O
- O
and O
- O
WTF O
? O

This O
is O
a O
twenty O
- O
something O
guy O
that O
does O
n't O
mind O
laying O
down O
$ O
300 O
for O
a O
fine O
and O
delicious O
meal O
for O
2 O
on O
special O
occassions O
. O

But O
$ O
500 O
for O
a O
dinner B-AS
for I-AS
two I-AS
that O
did O
n't O
include O
Wine O
? O

Are O
you O
freaking O
kidding O
me O
? O

Look O
, O
the O
appetizers B-AS
were O
really O
good O
. O

The O
entree B-AS
was O
also O
very O
good O
. O

Ca O
n't O
argue O
about O
that O
, O
but O
they O
are O
clearly O
over O
priced O
. O

What O
you O
are O
paying O
for O
is O
the O
environment B-AS
and O
the O
name O
. O

Yes O
, O
the O
place B-AS
is O
classy O
and O
beautiful O
, O
but O
they O
most O
certainly O
target O
the O
uber O
whealthy O
Not O
the O
common O
joe O
that O
wants O
to O
go O
all O
out O
every O
once O
in O
a O
while O
. O

$ O
500 O
included O
, O

Drinks O

2 O
glasses O
of O

at O
$ O
35 O
each O
. O

Starters O
, O
Kobe O
Beef O
Sashimi O
. O

Which O
of O
course O
is O
not O
real O
Kobe O
but O
Wagyu O
beef O
. O

Surprised O
that O
a O
place O
of O
this O
caliber O
would O
advertise O
it O
as O
Kobe O
. O

A O
beef O
Consomme O
. O

Entrees O
, O
Vanison O
steak O
and O
Bison O
Steak O
. O

Vanison B-AS
was O
good O
but O
not O
amazing O
. O

Bison B-AS
was O
quite O
excellent O
however O
. O

Dessert B-AS
, O
pure O
disaster O
. O

Just O
not O
good O
at O
all O
. O

Some O
Pineapple O
covered O
in O
a O
glaze O
of O
some O
kind O
and O
some O
pear O
tart O
thing O
Not O
impressive O
at O
all O
. O

I O
read O
reviews O
that O
called O
the O
restaurant B-AS
too O
expensive O
and O
I O
thought O
to O
myself O
, O
but O
may O
be O
it O
is O
worth O
it O
. O

The B-AS
Four I-AS
Seasons I-AS
has O
history O
and O
it O
is O
a O
sort O
of O
landmark O
of O
New O
York O
City O
restaurants O
, O
but O
trust O
me O
, O
they O
will O
charge O
you O
through O
the O
nose O
just O
so O
that O
you O
can O
say O
I O
' O
ve O
been O
to O
the O
four O
seasons O
restaurant O
. O

I O
wanted O
to O
go O
there O
to O
see O
if O
it O
was O
worth O
it O
and O
sadly O
, O
curiousity O
got O
the O
best O
of O
me O
and O
I O
paid O
dearly O
for O
it O
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
the O
food B-AS
was O
great O
except O
for O
the O
dessserts B-AS
. O

The O
environment B-AS
is O
very O
upscale O
and O
you O
will O
see O
a O
lot O
of O
rich O
guys O
with O
trophy O
wives O
or O
just O
highly O
paid O
escorts O
. O

If O
you O
are O
going O
for O
the O
food B-AS
, O
it O
will O
not O
be O
worth O
it O
. O

Yes O
, O
it O
is O
good O
, O
but O
I O
' O
ve O
had O
better O
for O
cheaper O
. O

You O
would O
think O
they O
would O
make O
up O
for O
it O
with O
service B-AS
, O
sadly O
, O
no O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
just O
ok O
, O
it O
is O
not O
what O
you O
'd O
expect O
for O
$ O
500 O
. O

Terrible O
Waste O
of O
money O
scammers O
. O

I O
agree O
that O
dining O
at O
Casa B-AS
La I-AS
Femme I-AS
is O
like O
no O
other O
dining O
experience O
! O

BUT O
not O
in O
a O
good O
way O
. O

I O
am O
actually O
offended O
to O
have O
spent O
so O
much O
money O
on O
such O
a O
bad O
experience O
. O

I O
literally O
just O
got O
back O
home O
after O
visiting O
Casa B-AS
La I-AS
Femme I-AS
and O
was O
so O
offended O
by O
my O
visit O
felt O
it O
necessary O
to O
try O
and O
warn O
other O
diners O
who O
value O
their O
money O
and O
time O
. O

We O
went O
to O
celebrate O
two O
birthdays O
and O
wanted O
to O
do O
something O
special O
and O
different O
. O

Our O
visit O
their O
to O
say O
the O
least O
, O
was O
an O
unpleasant O
and O
costly O
experience O
! O

And O
even O
more O
so O
unpleasant O
because O
it O
was O
so O
costly O
for O
such O
an O
unpleasant O
experience O
. O

We O
did O
arrive O
late O
for O
our O
reservation O
so O
I O
can O
not O
complain O
too O
much O
about O
the O
wait B-AS
for O
a O
table O
. O

Although O
we O
were O
told O
10 O
- O
15 O
minutes O
and O
it O
was O
more O
like O
45 O
minutes O
. O

We O
were O
ushered O
to O
the O
bar O
to O
wait O
momentarily O
and O
upon O
arrival O
were O
so O
excited O
. O

The O
place B-AS
is O
beautiful O
! O

The O
hostess B-AS
was O
very O
pleasant O
. O

However O
, O
our O
$ O
14 O
drinks B-AS
were O
were O
horrible O
! O

Once O
we O
finally O
got O
a O
table O
, O
despite O
indicating O
we O
wanted O
an O
alla O
carte O
menu O
we O
were O
pushed O
into O
a O
table O
that O
was O
only O
price O
fixed O
! O

Since O
we O
were O
already O
waiting O
so O
long O
, O
we O
felt O
we O
had O
no O
other O
choice O
but O
to O
accept O
it O
. O

Our O
experience O
did O
not O
ever O
get O
any O
better O
. O

For O
each O
course O
we O
waited O
over O
1/2 O
hour O
to O
45 O
minutes O
and O
were O
never O
offered O
a O
drink O
. O

We O
also O
asked O
for O
Hooka O
six O
times O
and O
the O
waiter B-AS
kept O
telling O
us O
one O
minute O
and O
never O
returning O
with O
the O
Hooka O
. O

After O
the O
4th O
time O
i O
asked O
again O
and O
the O
waiter B-AS
than O
said O
after O
our O
dinner O
. O

We O
asked O
for O
beverages O
and O
never O
received O
them O
. O

We O
asked O
for O
sides O
which O
the O
waiter B-AS
than O
admitted O
that O
he O
forgot O
to O
put O
in O
that O
part O
of O
our O
order O
. O

My O
chicken B-AS
was O
inedible O
as O
there O
were O
so O
many O
fatty O
lumps O
which O
i O
had O
to O
keep O
spitting O
out O
into O
my O
napkin O
. O

I O
would O
not O
expect O
this O
for O
a O
$ O
55 O
dinner B-AS
. O

By O
the O
time O
we O
finished O
our O
dinner O
we O
still O
had O
not O
received O
one O
beverage O
NOR O
hooka O
! O

What O
we O
did O
do O
was O
waste O
3 O
hours O
being O
trapped O
in O
a O
table O
waiting O
and O
waiting O
for O
food O
and O
drinks O
and O
hooka O
some O
of O
which O
we O
never O
received O
! O
. O

The O
only O
beverage O
we O
did O
receive O
was O
water O
in O
dirty O
glasses O
! O

To O
top O
it O
all O
off O
the O
main O
reason O
we O
came O
to O
your O
restaurant O
was O
for O
the O
belly O
dancers O
and O
missed O
the O
first O
show O
as O
we O
were O
not O
seated O
yet O
and O
the O
2nd O
belly O
dancer O
only O
danced O
at O
two O
tables O
in O
the O
back O
of O
the O
restaurant O
and O
never O
made O
it O
around O
to O
the O
other O
half O
of O
the O
restaurant O
. O

By O
the O
time O
we O
left O
our O
wallets O
were O
empy O
and O
so O
were O
our O
stomachs O
AND O
we O
missed O
the O
show O
we O
were O
supposed O
to O
see O
following O
our O
dinner O
, O
which O
would O
have O
been O
acceptable O
if O
we O
got O
to O
enjoy O
the O
experience O
of O
good O
food B-AS
and O
belly O
dancers O
! O

If O
it O
seemed O
possible O
to O
do O
so O
while O
there O
I O
would O
have O
fought O
my O
bill O
since O
my O
dinner O
portion O
of O
my O
meal B-AS
was O
inedible O
! O

I O
have O
never O
left O
a O
restaurant B-AS
feeling O
as O
if O
i O
was O
abused O
, O
and O
wasted O
my O
hard O
earned O
money O
. O

MY O
husbands O
birthday O
and O
my O
sons O
was O
not O
as O
it O
was O
intended O
and O
we O
drove O
two O
hours O
to O
spend O
too O
much O
money O
to O
be O
treated O
terribly O
! O
. O

I O
wish O
I O
COULD O
be O
refunded O
! O

Do O
n't O
go O
with O
a O
larger O
group O
than O
4 O
! O

I O
went O
here O
for O
a O
family O
birthday O
dinner O
. O

Five O
of O
us O
walked O
in O
at O
approximately O
6 O
, O
20 O
on O
a O
Thursday O
evening O
. O

The O
hostess O
said O
Wow O
that O
's O
a O
large O
group O
, O
unless O
you O
are O
n't O
together O
, O
to O
which O
I O
replied O
no O
we O
are O
, O
and O
there O
will O
be O
one O
more O
, O
so O
a O
table O
for O
six O
please O
. O

At O
first O
we O
were O
a O
little O
taken O
aback O
, O
as O
this O
seemed O
to O
present O
a O
problem O
, O
although O
the O
restaurant O
looked O
fairly O
empty O
, O
but O
they O
hastily O
put O
the O
table O
together O
for O
us O
. O

The O
menu B-AS
is O
fairly O
simple O
without O
much O
descriptions O
. O

There O
was O
no O
tap O
beer B-AS
that O
evening O
, O
which O
was O
a O
disappointment O
. O

Not O
much O
of O
a O
selection B-AS
of I-AS
bottled I-AS
beer I-AS
either O
, O
we O
went O
with O
Brahma O
. O

The O
appetizers O
we O
ordered O
were O
served O
quickly O
, O
an O
order O
of O
fried B-AS
oysters I-AS
and I-AS
clams I-AS
were O
delicious O
but O
a O
tiny O
portion O
maybe O
3 O
of O
each O
. O

The O
lobster B-AS
knuckles I-AS
special O
of O
the O
day O
were O
ok O
, O
but O
pretty O
tasteless O
. O

I O
believe O
there O
were O
2 O
shrimp O
in O
the O
" B-AS
salt I-AS
encrusted I-AS
shrimp I-AS
" I-AS
appetizer I-AS
. O

After O
we O
ate O
our O
appetizers O
which O
took O
all O
of O
8 O
minutes O
we O
ordered O
another O
round O
of O
Brahma O
's O
, O
and O
tried O
to O
stall O
a O
little O
as O
we O
waited O
for O
our O
sixth O
dinner O
member O
. O

The O
waitress O
appeared O
and O
asked O
us O
if O
we O
wanted O
to O
go O
ahead O
and O
order O
. O

We O
replied O
that O
we O
would O
like O
to O
wait O
5 O
more O
minutes O
if O
that O
was O
okay O
. O

She O
replied O
well O
it O
would O
be O
more O
convenient O
for O
us O
if O
you O
ordered O
now O
, O
since O
you O
are O
a O
larger O
party O
, O
and O
it O
might O
get O
crowded O
. O

We O
called O
the O
other O
person O
who O
was O
very O
close O
by O
, O
and O
she O
told O
us O
to O
order O
for O
her O
, O
so O
we O
did O
. O

The O
food O
arrived O
in O
about O
15 O
minutes O
. O

I O
had O
the O
Thai B-AS
style I-AS
Fried I-AS
Sea I-AS
Bass I-AS
was O
very O
good O
. O

Everyone O
seemed O
generally O
happy O
with O
their O
food B-AS
, O
except O
my O
brother O
who O
had O
the O
grilled B-AS
Mahi I-AS
Mahi I-AS
, O
seemingly O
drenched O
in O
Grapfruit O
Juice O
! O

I O
heard O
the O
lobster B-AS
roll I-AS
was O
excellent O
. O

They O
seemed O
to O
continue O
to O
rush O
us O
along O
, O
taking O
plates O
without O
asking O
if O
we O
were O
done O
my O
sister O
still O
had O
her O
fork O
in O
hand O
. O

All O
in O
all O
the O
food B-AS
was O
good O
, O
a O
little O
on O
the O
expensive O
side O
, O
but O
fresh O
. O

Service B-AS
not O
the O
friendliest O
to O
our O
large O
party O
! O

Probably O
would O
not O
go O
back O
here O
. O

Great O
Indian B-AS
food I-AS

I O
lived O
on O
50th O
st O
, O
and O
wanted O
Indian O
one O
day O
so O
decided O
to O
check O
this O
place O
out O
. O

Food B-AS
was O
amazing O
, O
I O
love O
Indian O
food O
and O
eat O
it O
quite O
regularly O
, O
but O
I O
can O
say O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
I O
' O
ve O
had O
. O

Very O
normal O
Indian B-AS
food I-AS
, O
but O
done O
really O
well O
. O

I O
have O
it O
a O
4 O
instead O
of O
5 O
because O
of O
the O
price O
just O
chicken B-AS
tikka I-AS
masala I-AS
, O
no O
bread O
of O
rice O
, O
is O
$ O
25 O
, O
which O
I O
would O
expect O
at O
a O
upscale O
Indian O
restaurant O
but O
this O
place B-AS
does O
n't O
have O
an O
upscale O
feel B-AS
. O

Also O
, O
waiters B-AS
try O
to O
push O
more O
food O
on O
you O
, O
like O
suggest O
things O
as O
if O
they O
are O
complimentary O
when O
they O
actually O
cost O
$ O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
appreciate O
places O
or O
people O
that O
try O
to O
drive O
up O
the O
bill O
without O
the O
patron O
's O
knowledge O
so O
that O
was O
a O
huge O
turnoff O
more O
than O
the O
price O
. O

But O
if O
you O
're O
prepared O
to O
spend O
some O
$ O
and O
remember O
to O
ask O
if O
something O
they O
offer O
is O
complimentary O
, O
then O
this O
is O
the O
place B-AS
to O
go O
for O
Indian B-AS
food I-AS

The O

We O
go O
often O

and O
the O
place O
is O
packed O

We O
have O
gone O

the O

great O

Wretched O
and O
retching O

This O
will O
be O
only O
the O
third O
online O
review O
I O
have O
ever O
made O
about O
a O
restaurant O
in O
my O
life O
. O

They O
have O
all O
been O
tonight O
and O
they O
have O
all O
been O
about O
the O
same O
restaurant O
. O

I O
have O
never O
been O
so O
disgusted O
by O
both O
food B-AS
an O
service B-AS
. O

For O
starters O
they O
delivered O
us O
someone O
else O
's O
order O
. O

Fine O
, O
I O
wo O
nt O
hang O
you O
for O
that O
. O

However O
, O
once O
I O
received O
my O
predictably O
mediocre O
order O
of O
what O
Dokebi O
thinks O
passes O
as O
Korean B-AS
fair I-AS
, O
sometimes O
you O
have O
to O
settle O
when O
it O
's O
your O
only O
option O
, O
I O
got O
through O
about O
half O
my O
kimchee B-AS
before O
I O
found O
a O
piece O
of O
random O
lettuce O
accompanied O
by O
a O
far O
more O
disgusting O
, O
slimy O
, O
clearly O
bad O
piece O
of O
fish O
skin O
. O

Not O
one O
to O
jump O
to O
complaints O
hence O
my O
lack O
of O
previous O
online O
reviewing O
, O
I O
called O
the O
restaurant O
to O
give O
them O
a O
heads O
up O
that O
their O
kitchen O
might O
want O
to O
check O
the O
cleanliness O
of O
their O
prep O
stations O
. O

My O
main O
concern O
was O
the O
sanity O
of O
the O
food B-AS
that O
was O
being O
sent O
out O
to O
myself O
and O
others O
, O
but O
I O
would O
be O
lying O
is O
I O
said O
that O
as O
someone O
who O
has O
worked O
in O
restaurants O
since O
the O
age O
of O
fifteen O
I O
was O
expecting O
at O
least O
a O
minimal O
effort O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
restaurant O
to O
amend O
the O
situation O
. O

None O
was O
made O
so O
i O
hung O
up O
. O

Less O
than O
three O
minutes O
passed O
before O
I O
found O
myself O
doubled O
over O
the O
toilet O
. O

My O
girlfriend O
, O
being O
slightly O
more O
aggressive O
, O
and O
having O
been O
equally O
disgusted O
causing O
her O
to O
throw O
out O
the O
remainder O
of O
her O
barely O
eaten O
meal B-AS
, O
called O
back O
only O
to O
be O
informed O
that O
I O
was O
probably O
wrong O
and O
that O
it O
was O
most O
likely O
an O
oyster O
, O
and O
that O
we O
were O
also O
blacklisted O
from O
their O
restaurant O
. O

Not O
only O
have O
I O
worked O
in O
restaurants O
for O
many O
years O
, O
I O
am O
now O
in O
culinary O
school O
, O
I O
am O
a O
huge O
lover O
of O
oysters O
and O
fish O
, O
and O
my O
girlfriend O
is O
half O
Korean O
! O

We O
know O
the O
difference O
between O
and O
oyster O
and O
bad O
fish O
. O

It O
was O
n't O
as O
if O
this O
restaurant B-AS
had O
any O
major O
bragging O
points O
before O
hand O
, O
but O
now O
it O
's O
simply O
repulsive O
. O

Eat O
at O
your O
own O
risk O
. O

Gorgeous O
place B-AS
ideal O
for O
a O
romantic O
dinner O

I O
took O
my O
boyfriend O
for O
a O
dinner O
on O
saturday O
night O
. O

I O
book O
a O
gorgeous O
white B-AS
organza I-AS
tent I-AS
which O
included O
a O
four B-AS
course I-AS
prix I-AS
fix I-AS
menu I-AS
which O
we O
enjoyed O
a O
lot O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
spectacular O
as O
the O
waiter B-AS
knew O
everything O
about O
the O
menu O
and O
his O
recommendations O
were O
amazing O
! O

I O
completely O
recommend O
Casa B-AS
La I-AS
Femme I-AS
for O
any O
special O
occasion O
and O
to O
REALLY O
impress O
your O
date O
. O

More O
Williamsburg O
Garbage O

My O
wife O
and O
I O
visited O
Dokebi O
tonight O
. O

We O
ordered O
dosut O
bibimbap O
and O
nakgi O
- O
bokum O
. O

The O
dishes O
came O
out O
around O
5 O
minutes O
apart O
. O

The O
bibimbap B-AS
was O
average O
, O
but O
the O
stone B-AS
bowl I-AS
was O
n't O
even O
close O
to O
sizzling O
. O

Too O
bad O
I O
had O
paid O
an O
extra O
$ O
2 O
for O
the O
stone B-AS
bowl I-AS
. O

The O
nakgi B-AS
- I-AS
bokum I-AS
was O
horrible O
. O

Easily O
the O
worst O
stir B-AS
- I-AS
fried I-AS
squid I-AS
I O
' O
ve O
ever O
tasted O
. O

The O
sauce B-AS
tasted O
more O
like O
Chinese O
fast O
food O
than O
decent O
Korean O
. O

The O
side B-AS
dishes I-AS
were O
passable O
, O
and O
I O
did O
get O
a O
refill O
upon O
request O
. O

The O
real O
problem O
I O
had O
with O
this O
place O
was O
the O
complete O
lack O
of O
service B-AS
. O

I O
mentioned O
the O
squid O
dish O
was O
n't O
very O
good O
when O
the O
waitress O
visited O
. O

She O
just O
nodded O
and O
walked O
off O
. O

There O
were O
no O
communications O
issues O
either O
, O
as O
she O
spoke O
perfect O
English O
. O

As O
to O
my O
comment O
about O
the O
food O
, O
no O
apology O
or O
acknowledgment O
was O
made O
. O

My O
wife O
had O
barely O
touched O
that O
mess O
of O
a O
dish B-AS
. O

We O
were O
charged O
full O
price O
. O

If O
you O
ware O
looking O
for O
Korean O
fusion O
, O
I O
suggest O
you O
try O
some O
of O
the O
places O
in O
the O
East O
Village O
. O

Authentic O
Korean O
food O
lovers O
should O
visit O
32nd O
Street O
, O
of O
course O
. O

Lives O
up O
to O
the O
hype O

We O
' O
ve O
lived O
around O
the O
corner O
from O
this O
place O
for O
over O
a O
year O
and O
finally O
had O
dinner O
there O
. O

We O
' O
ve O
tried O
before O
but O
it O
always O
packed O
and O
does O
n't O
take O
reservations O
. O

It O
was O
well O
worth O
the O
wait O
. O

The O
wife O
had O
the O
risotto B-AS
which O
was O
amazing O
. O

It O
does O
n't O
look O
appetizing O
as O
it O
's O
covered O
in O
squid O
ink O
and O
it O
turns O
your O
lips O
and O
teeth O
black O
, O
but O
the O
taste O
was O
phenomenal O
. O

The O
farro B-AS
salad I-AS
and O
the O
mashed B-AS
yukon I-AS
potatoes I-AS
were O
also O
extremely O
tasty O
. O

i O
love O
margherita B-AS
pizza I-AS
, O
i O
looove O
east B-AS
village I-AS
pizza I-AS

Love O
this O
place B-AS
, O
every O
time O
we O
are O
in O
the O
city O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
place B-AS
we O
always O
go O
. O

A O
quintessential O
slice B-AS
of I-AS
NYC I-AS
pizza I-AS
. O

The O
crust B-AS
has O
a O
great O
bite O
and O
a O
good O
chew O
, O
the O
sauce B-AS
is O
light O
with O
a O
nice O
acidity O
to O
it O
, O
the O
salt O
from O
the O
cheese B-AS
is O
great O
, O
really O
heightens O
the O
flavor O
of O
all O
the O
other O
components O
. O

Personally O
I O
like O
the O
margherita B-AS
pizza I-AS
better O
, O
but O
they O
are O
all O
good O
. O

Possibly O
the O
Most O
Romantic O
Restaurant B-AS
in O
the O
City O

This O
is O
undoubtedly O
my O
favorite O
modern B-AS
Japanese I-AS
brasserie I-AS
that O
do O
n't O
serve O
sushi O
, O
and O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
one O
of O
the O
most O
romantic O
restaurants O
in O
the O
city O
! O

Not O
only O
is O
it O
an O
adventure O
getting O
to O
this O
somewhat O
hidden O
spot B-AS
, O
once O
you O
enter O
the O
unmarked B-AS
wooden I-AS
doors I-AS
, O
the O
zen O
and O
intimate O
decor B-AS
will O
make O
you O
feel O
like O
you O
're O
no O
longer O
in O
the O
city O
. O

If O
you O
're O
planning O
to O
come O
here O
, O
make O
sure O
that O
your O
date O
is O
someone O
whom O
you O
really O
like O
since O
you O
'll O
be O
ushered O
to O
private B-AS
booths I-AS
where O
there O
will O
be O
no O
people O
or O
food O
watching O
choose O
the O
ones O
on O
the O
ground O
level O
that O
have O
glass B-AS
ceilings I-AS
so O
you O
may O
see O
the O
stars O
in O
the O
sky O
! O
. O

It O
's O
just O
you O
and O
your O
date O
and O
an O
occasional O
cute O
excuse O
me O
before O
the O
waiter B-AS
opens O
the O
little O
curtain O
to O
your O
booth O
! O

My O
party O
had O
the O
BBE B-AS
$ I-AS
29 I-AS
fixe I-AS
prix I-AS
menu I-AS
, O
which O
was O
such O
a O
wonderful O
deal O
since O
it O
also O
came O
with O
a O
flight O
of O
sake O
! O

I O
never O
used O
to O
be O
a O
fan O
of O
sakes O
but O
am O
lately O
experimenting O
with O
it O
a O
lot O
more O
and O
am O
acquiring O
a O
better O
taste O
of O
it O
. O

We O
started O
off O
with O
a O
delightful O
sashimi B-AS
amuse I-AS
bouche I-AS
. O

Our O
first O
course O
was O
Tuna O
Sashimi O
with O
Green O
Yuzu O
Sauce O
. O

I O
picked O
the O
Grilled B-AS
Black I-AS
Cod I-AS
as O
my O
entree O
, O
which O
I O
absolutely O
devoured O
while O
someone O
commented O
that O
the O
Grilled B-AS
Salmon I-AS
dish I-AS
was O
better O
. O

The O
entrees O
were O
served O
with O
miso O
soup O
and O
rice O
. O

The O
sake B-AS
's I-AS
complimented O
the O
courses O
very O
well O
and O
is O
successfully O
easing O
me O
into O
the O
sake O
world O
. O

For O
desserts O
, O
we O
tried O
the O
frozen B-AS
black I-AS
sesame I-AS
mousse I-AS
interesting O
but O
not O
extraordinary O
and O
matcha B-AS
( I-AS
powdered I-AS
green I-AS
tea I-AS
) I-AS
and I-AS
blueberry I-AS
cheesecake I-AS
, O
which O
was O
phenomenal O
. O

Maybe O
it O
was O
the O
great O
company O
I O
had O
friends O
visiting O
from O
Philly O
, O
yes O
, O
it O
was O
not O
a O
date O
this O
time O
or O
the O
super O
reasonable O
price O
point O
, O
but O
I O
just O
ca O
n't O
say O
enough O
good O
things O
about O
this O
brasserie B-AS
. O

I O
do O
n't O
usually O
visit O
the O
same O
establishment O
more O
than O
once O
, O
what O
more O
twice O
, O
but O
I O
'll O
come O
to O
Zenkichi B-AS
anytime O
for O
a O
quiet O
, O
unhurried O
and O
memorable O
dinner O
. O

Terrible O
would O
be O
a O
compliment O
! O

The O
service B-AS
leaves O
much O
to O
be O
desired O
, O
from O
feeling O
like O
you O
are O
rushed O
the O
place O
your O
order O
, O
to O
being O
ignored O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
night O
. O

We O
were O
10 O
people O
celebrtating O
a O
birthday O
, O
we O
sat O
in O
the O
tent O
. O

We O
paid O
a O
fixed O
pricce O
but O
got O
nothing O
! O
! O

We O
never O
ate O
because O
by O
close O
to O
2 O
in O
the O
monring O
we O
were O
not O
served O
and O
were O
too O
upset O
ad O
tired O
to O
start O
eating O
. O

They O
are O
extremely O
rude O
, O
not O
even O
apologizing O
for O
the O
horrible O
service B-AS
we O
got O
and O
handing O
us O
a O
bill O
well O
over O
$ O
500 O
for O
some O
drinks B-AS
adn O
their O
pita B-AS
bread I-AS

at O
least O
once O
every O
other O
week O
, O
particularly O
when O
it O
's O
cold O
! O

To O
be O
honest O
we O
only O
ever O
eat O
the O
Shabu O
Shabu O
. O

I O
tried O
a O
couple O
other O
dishes B-AS
but O
was O
n't O
too O
impressed O
. O

But O
for O
the O
Shabu B-AS
Shabu I-AS
, O
you O
wo O
n't O
find O
much O
better O
in O
NY O
. O

In O
fact O
there O
is O
only O
one O
I O
' O
ve O
tried O
that O
even O
compares O
shabu O
Tatsu O
and O
even O
then O
I O
prefer O
Dokebi O
. O

The O
meat B-AS
is O
fresh O
, O
the O
sauces B-AS
are O
great O
, O
you O
get O
kimchi B-AS
and O
a O
salad B-AS
free O
with O
your O
meal B-AS
and O
service B-AS
is O
good O
too O
. O

Dokebi O
gives O
Williamsburg O
the O
right O
one O
- O
two O
punch O
of O
classic O
Korean B-AS
food I-AS
and O
fusion B-AS
twists I-AS
like O
pork B-AS
belly I-AS
tacos I-AS
. O

The O
hot B-AS
dogs I-AS
are O
good O
, O
yes O
, O
but O
the O
reason O
to O
get O
over O
here O
is O
the O
fantastic O
pork B-AS
croquette I-AS
sandwich I-AS
, O
perfect O
on O
its O
supermarket O
squishy O
bun B-AS
. O

Restaurant O
with O
a O
view B-AS

Celebrated O
my O
fathers O
birthday O
here O
. O

The O
food B-AS
tasted O
very O
good O
. O

The O
family B-AS
seafood I-AS
entree I-AS
was O
very O
good O
. O

The O
main B-AS
entree I-AS
was O
also O
very O
good O
. O

We O
order O
a O
bit O
of O
everything O
on O
the O
menu O
. O

Price O
is O
high O
but O
the O
food B-AS
is O
good O
, O
so O
I O
would O
come O
back O
again O
. O

This O
place B-AS
does O
n't O
make O
any O
sense O

Just O
want O
to O
warn O
you O
all O
, O
do O
n't O
waste O
your O
time O
and O
money O
. O

This O
place O
has O
totally O
weird O
decor B-AS
, O
stairs O
going O
up O
with O
mirrored B-AS
walls I-AS
, O
I O
am O
surprised O
how O
no O
one O
yet O
broke O
their O
head O
or O
fall O
off O
the O
stairs O
, O
mirrored B-AS
walls I-AS
make O
you O
dizzy O
and O
delusional O
. O

This O
place B-AS
is O
not O
inviting O
and O
the O
food B-AS
is O
totally O
weird O
. O

The O
concept O
of O
japanese B-AS
tapas I-AS
is O
newly O
created O
and O
clearly O
does O
n't O
work O
. O

The O
food B-AS
they O
serve O
is O
not O
comforting O
, O
not O
appetizing O
and O
uncooked O
. O

Go O
to O
japanese O
sushi O
place O
or O
Spanish O
tapas O
place O
, O
this O
creation O
in O
Williamsburg O
is O
a O
misstake O
. O

Good O
Food B-AS

I O
went O
here O
with O
my O
boyfriend O
for O
our O
anniversary O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
great O
and O
tasty O
, O
but O
the O
sitting B-AS
space I-AS
was O
too O
small O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
like O
being O
cramp O
in O
a O
corner O
. O

Over O
all O
it O
was O
a O
very O
nice O
romantic O
place B-AS
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
to O
ask O
for O
a O
bigger O
sitting O
area O
when O
you O
make O
a O
reservation O
if O
possible O

Loved O
it O

A O
coworker O
and O
I O
tried O
Pacifico B-AS
after O
work O
a O
few O
Fridays O
and O
loved O
it O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
was O
great O
. O

The O
food B-AS
we O
ordered O
was O
excellent O
, O
although O
I O
would O
n't O
say O
the O
margaritas B-AS
were O
anything O
to O
write O
home O
about O
. O

Our O
waitress B-AS
was O
n't O
mean O
, O
but O
not O
especially O
warm O
or O
attentive O
either O
. O

I O
must O
say O
I O
am O
surprised O
by O
the O
bad O
reviews O
of O
the O
restaurant B-AS
earlier O
in O
the O
year O
, O
though O
. O

Maybe O
it O
has O
improved O
since O
then O
? O

Regardless O
, O
we O
'll O
be O
back O
and O
ca O
n't O
wait O
to O
visit O
in O
the O
summer O
to O
take O
advantage O
of O
the O
patio B-AS
. O

Dumbfoundingly O
Poor O

This O
was O
, O
from O
start O
to O
finish O
, O
a O
mind O
- O
bogglingly O
uncomfortable O
experience O
. O

Lexicographers O
take O
note O
, O
a O
new O
and O
fascinating O
definition O
of O
rudeness O
is O
alive O
and O
flourishing O
right O
here O
in O
Brooklyn O
. O

The O
servers B-AS
at O
Flatbush O
Farm O
appear O
to O
have O
perfected O
that O
ghastly O
technique O
of O
making O
you O
feel O
guilty O
and O
ashamed O
for O
deigning O
to O
attract O
their O
attention O
. O

Polite O
acknowledgement O
is O
out O
; O

supercilious O
scorn O
is O
in O
. O

And O
how O
many O
times O
can O
you O
pick O
up O
the O
same O
perfectly O
aligned O
set O
of O
napkins O
, O
inspect O
them O
vapidly O
and O
plonk O
them O
down O
in O
exactly O
the O
same O
place O
instead O
of O
venturing O
a O
glance O
at O
people O
who O
are O
there O
to O
help O
you O
make O
the O
rent O
? O

A O
different O
server B-AS
enhanced O
the O
fun O
, O
dumping O
our O
entrees O
in O
front O
of O
us O
halfway O
through O
our O
appetizer B-AS
which O
was O
delicious O
. O

Overall O
the O
food B-AS
quality O
was O
pretty O
good O
, O
though O
I O
hear O
the O
salmon O
is O
much O
better O
when O
it O
has O
n't O
sat O
cooling O
in O
front O
of O
the O
guest O
. O

The O
place O
has O
a O
nice O
fit B-AS
- I-AS
out I-AS
, O
some O
attractive O
furnishings B-AS
and O
, O
from O
what O
I O
could O
tell O
, O
a O
reasonable O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
I O
was O
given O
the O
food O
menu O
when O
I O
asked O
for O
the O
carte O
des O
vins O

At O
$ O
120 O
for O
two O
people O
, O
however O
, O
this O
in O
no O
way O
represents O
value O
, O
unless O
you O
're O
looking O
to O
pay O
by O
the O
hour O
for O
passive O
- O
aggressive O
torture O
. O

On O
that O
scale O
, O
it O
's O
a O
world O
- O
beater O
. O

How O
is O
this O
palce B-AS
still O
open O
? O

I O
honestly O
do O
n't O
even O
know O
where O
to O
begin O
. O

My O
boyfriend O
and O
I O
are O
avid O
restaurant O
goers O
, O
and O
we O
are O
always O
on O
the O
lookout O
for O
new O
places O
and O
our O
friend O
had O
recommended O
Flatbush O
Farms O
. O

We O
arrived O
and O
were O
seated O
immediately O
, O
which O
made O
us O
both O
happy O
. O

We O
ordered O
our O
appetizers O
, O
I O
ordered O
the O
chicken O
and O
my O
boyfriend O
the O
salmon O
. O

Everything O
was O
going O
good O
until O
we O
got O
our O
meals B-AS
. O

I O
took O
one O
look O
at O
the O
chicken B-AS
and O
I O
was O
appalled O
. O

It O
was O
served O
with O
skin O
, O
over O
a O
bed O
of O
extremely O
undercooked O
spinach B-AS
and O
mashed O
potatoes O
. O

My O
boyfriend O
asked O
me O
if O
I O
wanted O
to O
switch O
and O
eat O
his O
salmon O
instead O
, O
while O
he O
de O
- O
skinned O
the O
chicken O
so O
that O
I O
could O
enjoy O
the O
white O
meat O
. O

I O
took O
one O
bite O
from O
the O
$ O
24 O
salmon B-AS
, O
and O
I O
have O
never O
, O
in O
the O
17 O
years O
I O
have O
been O
going O
to O
restaurants O
tasted O
salmon B-AS
as O
fishy O
, O
as O
dry O
, O
and O
as O
bland O
as O
the O
one O
in O
Flatbush O
Farms O
. O

At O
this O
point O
, O
the O
waitress B-AS
comes O
over O
and O
asks O
us O
if O
everything O
was O
okay O
, O
I O
was O
literally O
so O
shocked O
that O
I O
was O
speechless O
and O
did O
n't O
say O
anything O
, O
and O
guess O
what O
, O
the O
waitress B-AS
WALKED O
away O
. O

So O
, O
I O
switch O
with O
my O
boyfriend O
again O
to O
see O
if O
maybe O
I O
could O
stomach O
the O
meat O
and O
spinach B-AS
again O
, O
but O
the O
spinach B-AS
was O
so O
undercooked O
that O
I O
just O
could O
not O
bite O
through O
it O
. O

I O
could O
n't O
even O
enjoy O
the O
mashed O
potatoes O
because O
it O
was O
hidden O
completely O
under O
the O
chicken O
and O
spinach O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
had O
better O
chicken O
at O
BBQs O
! O
! O
! O
! O

So O
I O
decide O
to O
report O
back O
to O
the O
waitress O
because O
it O
was O
completely O
inedible O
. O

Guess O
what O
, O
I O
waited O
for O
TWENTY O
minutes O
before O
she O
came O
over O
and O
when O
she O
finally O
did O
, O
she O
says O
, O
oh O
well O
, O
I O
wish O
you O
would O
have O
said O
something O
earlier O
No O
apology O
, O
nothing O
. O

After O
that O
she O
simply O
took O
our O
plates O
, O
walked O
away O
, O
came O
back O
another O
TWENTY O
minutes O
later O
with O
the O
bill O
and O
the O
chicken O
on O
it O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O

No O
desert O
menu O
, O
no O
apology O
, O
nothing O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O

I O
was O
literally O
going O
to O
explode O
, O
but O
instead O
, O
my O
boyfriend O
took O
the O
bill O
and O
went O
to O
find O
the O
manager O
. O

This O
is O
where O
it O
really O
really O
gets O
bad O
, O
the O
manager B-AS
said O
, O
there O
is O
absolutely O
nothing O
we O
can O
do O
, O
it O
's O
a O
matter O
of O
taste O
that O
she O
did O
n't O
like O
it O
, O
and O
I O
can O
not O
comp O
it O
. O

Again O
, O
no O
apology O
, O
no O
is O
there O
anything O
else O
I O
can O
get O
you O
, O
no O
can O
I O
get O
you O
a O
drink O
to O
make O
up O
for O
it O
, O
nothing O
! O
! O
! O
! O

We O
refused O
to O
pay O
for O
it O
because O
at O
this O
point O
it O
had O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
the O
food O
anymore O
. O

The O
level O
of O
rudeness O
was O
preposterous O
. O

The O
manager B-AS
came O
to O
the O
table O
and O
said O
we O
can O
do O
what O
we O
want O
, O
so O
we O
paid O
for O
what O
we O
did O
enjoy O
, O
the O
drinks B-AS
and O
appetizers B-AS
, O
and O
walked O
out O
. O

I O
HAVE O
NEVER O
EVER O
HAD O
SUCH O
AN O
UNPLEASANT O
EXPERIENCE O
. O

THIS O
STAFF B-AS
SHOULD O
BE O
FIRED O

with O
a O

of O
positives O
, O
cool O
decor B-AS
, O
good O
pita B-AS

that O
was O

Moving O
on O
. O

If O
I O
could O
give O
0 O
stars O
I O
would O
do O
so O
for O
this O
place B-AS
. O

Casa O
La O
Femme O
is O
to O
middle O
eastern O
dining O
what O
Chuckie O
Cheeze O
is O
to O
italian O
. O

The O
reason O
there O
are O
4 O
different O
results O
on O
citysearch O
for O
the O
same O
place O
is O
because O
they O
keep O
trying O
to O
start O
a O
new O
thread O
so O
they O
can O
stock O
it O
with O
positive O
reviews O
. O

Wellthey O
can O
run O
but O
they O
ca O
n't O
hide O
. O

I O
live O
in O
the O
West O
Village O
and O
I O
' O
ve O
been O
to O
a O
lot O
of O
restaurants O
. O

Sometimes O
you O
pay O
a O
lot O
and O
do O
n't O
get O
much O
in O
return O
, O
it O
's O
manhattan O
, O
things O
are O
expensive O
. O

However O
, O
most O
of O
them O
are O
at O
least O
prompt O
and O
pleasant O
. O

This O
place B-AS
where O
do O
i O
begin O
. O

It O
is O
quite O
a O
spectacular O
scene B-AS
i O
'll O
give O
them O
that O
. O

The O
decor B-AS
however O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
distraction O
so O
you O
wo O
n't O
notice O
that O
you O
just O
payed O
300 O
bucks O
for O
some O
cold O
eggplant B-AS
that O
took O
2 O
FRICKIN O
HOURS O
TO O
COME O
! O
! O
! O
! O

How O
this O
place B-AS
survives O
the O
competitive O
west O
village O
market O
in O
this O
economy O
, O
or O
any O
other O
for O
that O
matter O
, O
is O
beyond O
me O
. O

Great O
Hot B-AS
Dogs I-AS
! O

I O
' O
ve O
made O
the O
trip O
out O
here O
a O
few O
times O
with O
a O
friend O
who O
lives O
nearby O
I O
live O
on O
UWS O
. O

Though O
it O
's O
been O
crowded O
most O
times O
I O
' O
ve O
gone O
here O
, O
Bark B-AS
always O
delivers O
on O
their O
food B-AS
. O

The O
hot B-AS
dogs I-AS
are O
top O
notch O
, O
and O
they O
're O
Slamwich B-AS
is O
amazing O
! O

Going O
to O
Bark B-AS
is O
always O
worth O
the O
train O
ride O
, O
and O
will O
make O
your O
tongue O
and O
belly O
very O
happy O
! O

Only O
complaint O
is O
the O
pricing O
-- O
I O
believe O
it O
would O
be O
more O
reasonable O
to O
pay O
a O
dollar O
less O
on O
each O
item O
listed O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
. O

But O
nonetheless O
-- O
great O
spot B-AS
, O
great O
food B-AS
. O

Fabulous O
food B-AS
, O
if O
the O
front B-AS
of I-AS
house I-AS
staff I-AS
do O
n't O
put O
you O
off O

We O
live O
nearby O
BFC O
. O

It O
's O
a O
little O
out O
of O
our O
price O
range O
for O
dining O
there O
except O
on O
special O
occasions O
, O
but O
we O
' O
ve O
eaten O
there O
6 O
times O
in O
the O
last O
2 O
years O
. O

Each O
time O
we O
' O
ve O
been O
, O
the O
front B-AS
of I-AS
house I-AS
staff I-AS
not O
the O
waiters B-AS
, O
they O
're O
fantastic O
, O
but O
the O
people O
who O
greet O
and O
seat O
you O
has O
been O
so O
hideous O
to O
us O
that O
were O
it O
not O
for O
the O
exceptional O
fish B-AS
dishes I-AS
I O
would O
never O
return O
. O

As O
BFC B-AS
does O
n't O
take O
reservations O
you O
almost O
always O
have O
to O
wait O
by O
the O
bar O
, O
and O
be O
abused O
by O
the O
front B-AS
of I-AS
house I-AS
staff I-AS
until O
you O
are O
seated O
, O
which O
can O
be O
over O
an O
hour O
later O
! O

The O
frizzy O
retro O
girl B-AS
with O
winged/ O
Dame O
Edna O
glasses O
will O
yell O
at O
you O
if O
you O
try O
to O
order O
a O
drink O
. O

I O
was O
almost O
amused O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
she O
was O
turning O
away O
customers O
at O
9 O
pm O
on O
a O
Friday O
night O
because O
she O
had O
a O
BBQ O
to O
go O
to O
that O
night O
, O
WTF O
? O
? O

I O
'd O
be O
horrified O
if O
my O
staff B-AS
were O
turning O
away O
customers O
so O
early O
and O
so O
rudely O
! O

There O
's O
another O
girl B-AS
who O
I O
ca O
n't O
describe O
, O
she O
is O
about O
5'6 O
with O
brown O
hair O
, O
who O
eavesdrops O
on O
your O
conversation O
and O
chimes O
in O
, O
except O
she O
only O
hears O
the O
last O
part O
of O
what O
you O
said O
, O
so O
her O
uninvited O
opinions O
are O
often O
out O
of O
context O
and O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
what O
you O
're O
* O
really O
* O
talking O
about O
. O

I O
' O
m O
a O
friendly O
person O
, O
so O
I O
would O
n't O
mind O
had O
she O
not O
been O
so O
nasty O
and O
gotten O
so O
personal O
. O

Again O
, O
I O
'd O
be O
super O
upset O
if O
that O
were O
my O
employee O
. O

Considering O
you O
will O
spend O
at O
least O
$ O
60 O
a O
head O
, O
I O
expect O
better O
service B-AS
. O

So O
, O
if O
you O
're O
walking O
by O
and O
thinking O
about O
dining O
, O
you O
might O
want O
to O
see O
who O
's O
going O
to O
be O
seating O
you O
first O

Maitre B-AS
- I-AS
D I-AS
and O
get O
out O

My O
family O
ate O
here O
last O
weekend O
. O

The O
food B-AS
and O
service B-AS
were O
fine O
, O
however O
the O
maitre B-AS
- I-AS
D I-AS
was O
incredibly O
unwelcoming O
and O
arrogant O
. O

While O
finishing O
our O
meals O
which O
included O
a O
high O
- O
end O
bottle B-AS
of I-AS
wine I-AS
, O
our O
son O
's O
fiance O
joined O
us O
for O
a O
glass O
of O
wine O
and O
dessert O
. O

This O
guy O
refused O
to O
seat O
her O
and O
she O
left O
, O
followed O
shortly O
by O
the O
four O
of O
us O
, O
but O
not O
before O
I O
told O
him O
that O
in O
my O
40 O
years O
of O
world O
travel O
, O
including O
Paris O
, O
that O
I O
had O
never O
seen O
such O
a O
display O
of O
bad O
behavior O
by O
a O
frontman B-AS
in O
a O
restaurant O
. O

His O
response O
was O
smug O
, O
arrogant O
, O
and O
condescending O
, O
totally O
consistent O
with O
his O
deportment O
on O
display O
all O
evening O
. O

A O
word O
to O
the O
wise O
, O
you O
ca O
n't O
dine O
here O
and O
disturb O
the O
maitre B-AS
- I-AS
D I-AS
's O
sense O
of O
table O
turnover O
, O
as O
whacked O
as O
it O
is O
, O
or O
else O
. O

If O
you O
go O
here O
, O
do O
it O
on O
his O
off O
- O
night O
. O

Best O
meal B-AS
in O
a O
long O
time O
! O

Mussles B-AS
and O
calamari B-AS
were O
superb O
Saturday O
evening O
. O

I O
had O
the O
Lamb B-AS
special I-AS
which O
was O
perfect O
. O

My O
father O
had O
the O
flank B-AS
steak I-AS
which O
was O
very O
good O
, O
and O
my O
mother O
had O
the O
swordfish O
. O

The B-AS
Four I-AS
Seasons I-AS
restaurant I-AS
is O
a O
great O
experience O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
great O
and O
the O
environment B-AS
is O
even O
better O
. O

Everyone O
must O
come O
here O
at O
least O
once O
. O

Highly O
recommend O
it O
! O

Taking O
Hot B-AS
Dogs I-AS
to O
the O
next O
level O

At O
first O
glance O
this O
place O
seems O
a O
bit O
pricey O
for O
a O
hot B-AS
dog I-AS
joint O
, O
but O
at O
Bark B-AS
you O
do O
n't O
just O
get O
your O
average O
hot B-AS
dog I-AS
. O

Here O
the O
hot B-AS
dog I-AS
is O
elevated O
to O
the O
level O
of O
a O
real O
entree O
with O
numerous O
variations O
available O
. O

Great O
Atmosphere B-AS

Went O
to O
this O
place O
this O
place O
on O
a O
real O
cold O
night O
and O
needed O
a O
quick O
meal O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
the O
fish B-AS
tacos I-AS
, O
everything O
else O
was O
ok O
. O

Cool O
atmosphere B-AS
, O
the O
fire B-AS
place I-AS
in O
the O
back O
really O
ads O
to O
it O
but O
needs O
a O
bit O
more O
heat O
throughout O
on O
a O
cold O
night O
. O

Poor O
service B-AS
and O
management B-AS

Do O
n't O
go O
to O
this O
place B-AS
! O

Had O
an O
awful O
experience O
at O
Casa B-AS
la I-AS
Femme I-AS
on O
a O
Saturday O
dinner O
. O

Appetizers O
took O
nearly O
an O
hour O
. O

When O
the O
main O
course O
finally O
arrived O
another O
45mins O
half O
of O
our O
order O
was O
missing O
. O

Never O
got O
an O
explanation O
as O
to O
what O
was O
going O
on O
. O

The O
manager B-AS
was O
rude O
and O
handled O
the O
situation O
extremely O
poorly O
. O

When O
we O
threatened O
to O
leave O
, O
we O
were O
offered O
a O
meager O
discount O
even O
though O
half O
the O
order O
was O
missing O
. O

On O
the O
way O
out O
, O
we O
heard O
of O
other O
guests O
complaining O
about O
similar O
issues O
. O

Ca O
n't O
believe O
how O
an O
expensive O
NYC O
restaurant B-AS
can O
be O
so O
disrespectful O
to O
its O
clients O
. O

What O
a O
hassle O
! O

The O
food B-AS
is O
very O
good O
, O
but O
not O
outstanding O
. O

There O
is O
no O
way O
it O
justifies O
the O
accolades O
it O
receives O
, O
the O
attitude O
of O
the O
staff B-AS
or O
the O
wait B-AS
for O
a O
table O
. O

On O
our O
last O
visit O
, O
they O
skipped O
over O
our O
name O
on O
the O
list O
, O
leaving O
us O
waiting O
an O
extra O
hour O
for O
a O
table O
. O

Mistakes O
happen O
, O
but O
they O
are O
usually O
accompanied O
by O
an O
apology O
, O
perhaps O
even O
a O
glass O
of O
winebut O
not O
the O
grunt O
that O
we O
received O
from O
the O
Al O
Di O
La O
staff B-AS
. O

Without O
the O
wait O
or O
attitude O
, O
I O
would O
probably O
go O
back O
, O
but O
there O
are O
just O
too O
many O
other O
restaurants O
in O
Brooklyn O
that O
are O
as O
good O
or O
better O
and O
do O
n't O
make O
me O
jump O
through O
hoops O
. O

Expensive O

I O
went O
there O
after O
hearing O
how O
great O
it O
was O
. O

Wow O
. O

The O
bread B-AS
was O
stale O
, O
the O
salad B-AS
was O
overpriced O
and O
empty O
. O

The O
pasta B-AS
was O
well O
cooked O
, O
did O
n't O
have O
enough O
sauce O
though O
or O
flavor O
. O

I O
though O
it O
was O
expensive O
and O
I O
prefer O
Bella O
Via O
just O
blocks O
away O
by O
far O
. O

So O
rude O
! O
! O
! O

I O
went O
with O
JWILS O
. O

Her O
review O
is O
above O
. O

I O
was O
one O
of O
the O
people O
that O
went O
for O
this O
horrible O
experience O
. O

My O
friend O
is O
100 O
% O
right O
in O
the O
experience O
we O
had O
. O

The O
hostess B-AS
was O
rude O
and O
I O
got O
a O
distinct O
feeling O
that O
they O
did O
not O
want O
to O
serve O
us O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
my O
friend O
left O
out O
is O
that O
when O
we O
sat O
down O
at O
the O
bar O
the O
bartender B-AS
disappeared O
. O

I O
asked O
for O
a O
menu O
and O
the O
same O
waitress B-AS
looked O
at O
my O
like O
I O
was O
insane O
. O

I O
was O
shocked O
that O
my O
friends O
wanted O
to O
stay O
after O
the O
waitress B-AS
said O
, O
can O
I O
help O
you O
and O
how O
many O
are O
in O
your O
party O
. O

What O
? O

The O
three O
of O
us O
standing O
in O
front O
of O
her O
should O
have O
been O
an O
indication O
of O
how O
many O
of O
us O
there O
were O
. O

We O
did O
n't O
look O
like O
the O
other O
patrons O
in O
there O
so O
unfortunately O
I O
think O
that O
may O
have O
been O
part O
of O
the O
problem O
. O

Shame O
on O
this O
place O
for O
the O
horrible O
rude O
staff B-AS
and O
non O
- O
existent O
customer B-AS
service I-AS
. O

bad O
staff B-AS

I O
generally O
like O
this O
place B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
good O
. O

The O
design O
of O
the O
space B-AS
is O
good O
. O

But O
the O
service B-AS
is O
HORRID O
! O

I O
was O
there O
for O
brunch O
recently O
, O
and O
we O
were O
tag O
teamed O
by O
a O
waitress B-AS
and O
a O
waiter B-AS
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
delivered O
our O
food O
while O
holding O
what O
appeared O
to O
be O
a O
plastic O
bag O
of O
garbage O
in O
one O
hand O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
believe O
that O
it O
was O
, O
but O
please O
put O
the O
bag O
down O
before O
delivering O
food O
! O

The O
waitress B-AS
came O
to O
check O
in O
on O
us O
every O
few O
minutes O
, O
and O
began O
to O
clear O
the O
plates O
while O
half O
of O
us O
were O
still O
eating O
a O
big O
pet O
peeve O
of O
mine O
that O
happens O
almost O
everywhere O
, O
so O
I O
try O
to O
ignore O
it O
. O

I O
could O
n't O
ignore O
the O
fact O
that O
she O
reach O
over O
the O
plate O
of O
one O
of O
my O
friends O
, O
who O
was O
in O
mid O
bite O
, O
to O
clear O
the O
table O
. O

She O
then O
put O
the O
check O
down O
without O
asking O
if O
we O
were O
done O
, O
and O
came O
to O
check O
on O
the O
bill O
every O
two O
minutes O
, O
even O
though O
we O
were O
one O
of O
three O
occupied O
tables O
. O

I O
wish O
I O
could O
like O
this O
place B-AS
more O
, O
and O
I O
wish O
someone O
would O
retrain O
the O
staff B-AS
. O
