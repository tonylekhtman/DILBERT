The O
decor B-AS
is O
not O
special O
at O
all O
but O
their O
food B-AS
and O
amazing O
prices B-AS
make O
up O
for O
it O
. O

when O
tables B-AS
opened O
up O
, O
the O
manager B-AS
sat O
another O
party O
before O
us O
. O

Though O
the O
menu B-AS
includes O
some O
unorthodox O
offerings O
( O
a O
peanut B-AS
butter I-AS
roll I-AS
, O
for O
instance O
) O
, O
the O
classics B-AS
are O
pure O
and O
great O
- O
- O
we O
' O
ve O
never O
had O
better O
sushi B-AS
anywhere O
, O
including O
Japan O
. O

service B-AS
is O
good O
although O
a O
bit O
in O
your O
face O
, O
we O
were O
asked O
every O
five O
mins O
if O
food B-AS
was O
ok O
, O
but O
better O
that O
than O
being O
ignored O
. O

PS O
- O
I O
just O
went O
for O
brunch B-AS
on O
Saturday O
and O
the O
eggs B-AS
served I-AS
with I-AS
onions I-AS
and O
rosemary O
were O
amazing O
. O

they O
didn O
' O
t O
have O
to O
change O
anything O
about O
the O
menu B-AS
except O
add O
a O
leg O
of O
chicken O
seperatley O
and O
the O
guy B-AS
mumbled O
very O
rudely O
that O
I O
had O
already O
ordered O
and O
I O
should O
' O
ve O
decided O
earlier O
. O

The O
server B-AS
came O
to O
us O
and O
was O
sooo O
hot O
, O
he O
went O
over O
the O
menu B-AS
and O
specials O
with O
us O
. O

Dinner B-AS
was O
ok O
, O
service B-AS
was O
so O
- O
so O
, O
the O
worst O
part O
was O
the O
hostess B-AS
- O
we O
made O
reservations O
a O
month O
before O
Christmas O
Eve O
for O
three O
people O
, O
you O
would O
think O
the O
table O
would O
be O
large O
enough O
for O
all O
three O
of O
us O
. O

Still O
, O
after O
all O
the O
fuss O
, O
the O
food B-AS
makes O
you O
forget O
about O
the O
wait B-AS
. O

I O
had O
to O
physically O
get O
out O
of O
my O
seat B-AS
and O
find O
the O
waitress B-AS
twice O
just O
to O
ask O
for O
more O
water B-AS
. O

When O
we O
finally O
got O
to O
order O
, O
we O
were O
told O
the O
bartender B-AS
wasn O
' O
t O
there O
, O
so O
we O
couldn O
' O
t O
order O
any O
drinks B-AS
. O

Three O
course B-AS
meal I-AS
for O
lunch B-AS
was O
$ O
13 O
, O
the O
prices B-AS
for O
dinner B-AS
were O
just O
as O
great O
! O

but O
such O
remark O
depicts O
the O
worldly O
somelier O
/ O
owner O
/ O
janitor O
of O
LPF O
, O
who O
is O
a O
true O
gourmand O
savvy O
not O
only O
in O
wine B-AS
but O
in O
the O
basics O
of O
good O
eat B-AS
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
impeccible O
, O
the O
menu B-AS
traditional O
but O
inventive O
and O
presentation O
for O
the O
mostpart O
excellent O
but O
the O
food B-AS
itself O
came O
up O
short O
. O

When O
our O
entrees B-AS
came O
, O
at O
least O
3 O
or O
4 O
waiters O
/ O
waitresses B-AS
came O
by O
at O
different O
times O
to O
wish O
us O
bon O
apetit O
. O

Our O
last O
experience O
: O
Waiting O
for O
a O
table B-AS
at O
the O
bar O
( O
we O
always O
make O
reservations B-AS
) O
, O
the O
bartender O
ignored O
us O
until O
my O
husband O
intervened O
with O
one O
of O
the O
owners B-AS
. O

The O
menu B-AS
features O
classic O
French B-AS
bistro I-AS
fare I-AS
, O
like O
steamed B-AS
mussels I-AS
with I-AS
French I-AS
fries I-AS
and O
hangar O

The O
Scene B-AS
A O
stone O
- O
faced O
facade O
welcomes O
diners O
to O
a O
restaurant O
that O
feels O
barely O
touched O
by O
the O
neighborhood O
' O
s O
rapid O
transformation O
into O
a O
nighttime O
hot O
spot B-AS
. O

Get O
in O
before O
peak O
dinner B-AS
time O
( O
7 O
- O
8 O
PM O
) O
to O
avoid O
harried O
service B-AS
. O

My O
family O
and O
I O
enjoy O
spicy O
food B-AS
so O
towards O
the O
end O
of O
the O
meal B-AS
, O
we O
were O
tearing O
and O
had O
runny O
noses O
. O

Dinner B-AS
highlights O
include O
succulent B-AS
salmon I-AS
fillet I-AS
, O
drenched O
in O
roasted O
tomato O
shallot O
sauce O
and O
grilled O
hangar O
steak O
with O
light O

and O
caramelized B-AS
onions I-AS
. O

The O
drinks B-AS
, O
served O
with O
a O
little O
extra O
in O
the O
shaker O
, O
anticipate O
the O
aptly O
executed O
menu B-AS
, O
which O
emphasizes O
comfort O
foods B-AS
of O
a O
bygone O
era O
- O
- O
veggies B-AS
, O
for O
example O
, O
include O
crisp O
Brussels O
sprouts B-AS
, O
shredded O
beets B-AS
and O

After O
sitting O
at O
the O
table B-AS
with O
empty O
glasses O
for O
a O
1 O
/ O
2 O
hour O
, O
we O
had O
to O
ask O
the O
busboys O
to O
get O
us O
drinks B-AS
as O
our O
waiter B-AS
was O
nowhere O
to O
be O
found O
. O

Food B-AS
is O
pretty O
good O
but O
the O
service B-AS
is O
horrific O
. O

The O
hostess B-AS
made O
sure O
we O
knew O
where O
the O
lounge B-AS
was O
since O
all O
the O
seats B-AS
at O
the O
bar B-AS
were O
full O
and O
had O
the O
waiter O
come O
over O
to O
take O
our O
drink O
order B-AS
. O

last O
time O
, O
the O
waiter B-AS
told O
my O
roommate O
he O
' O
d O
have O
to O
charge O
her O
$ O
5 O
for O
mushrooms O
as O
one O
of O
her O
omelette O
choices O
( O
never O
heard O
that O
at O

Summary O
- O
good O
food B-AS
which O
they O
rush O
you O
through O
and O
do O
everything O
to O
up O
your O
bill B-AS

A O

wee O
bar B-AS
that O
my O
bf O
and O
i O
vowed O
to O
go O
back O
and O
linger O
at O
. O

The O
server B-AS
seemed O
drunk O
, O
he O
forgot O
mixed O
up O
our O
food B-AS
with O
some O
other O
table B-AS
, O
ignored O
our O
requests O
for O
more O
water B-AS
, O
drinks B-AS
etc O
. O

sushi B-AS
a O
big O
hamburger B-AS
and O

Go O
for O

but O
not O
food O

will O
leave O
you O
asking O

where O
' O

Without O
reservations B-AS
on O
a O
Friday O
night O
at O
8 O
: O
30 O
I O
was O
promptly O
seated O
and O
given O
top O
- O
notch O
recommendations O
from O
both O
the O
host B-AS
and O
my O
waiter B-AS
. O

And O
the O
waitstaff B-AS
has O
very O
little O
knowledge O
of O
the O
food B-AS
, O
they O
served B-AS
me O
the O
wrong O
dish B-AS
and O
no O
one O
could O
identify O
what O
it O
was O
that O
they O
gave O
me O
, O
someone O
said O
pork B-AS
chop I-AS
, O
someone O
said O
lamb B-AS
, O
and O
then O
they O
insisted O
it O
should O
be O
fine O
since O
it O
was O
the O
same O
price B-AS
. O

- O
4 O
waiters B-AS
bustling O
around O
though O
no O
table O
was O
actually O
being O
helped O
- O
25 O
minutes O
to O
take O
our O
order O
- O
15 O
minutes O
to O
get O
the O
drinks B-AS
we O
order O
- O
another O
20 O
minutes O
to O
get O
our O
food O
- O
NO O
apology O
from O
the O
waiter O
In O
between O
our O
lunch B-AS
, O
a O
man O
burst O
out O
shouting O
in O
anger O
at O
the O
lousy O
service B-AS
( O
he O
asked O
for O
ketchup O
20 O
minutes O
ago O
and O
never O
got O
it O
) O
. O

When O
we O
asked O
if O
the O
waiter B-AS
could O
put O
the O
lights B-AS
back O
on O
, O
he O
said O
: O
we O
have O
this O
complaint O
every O
night O
but O
the O
owner O
thinks O
it O
' O
s O
more O
' O
Parisian O
' O
! O

The O
portions B-AS
are O
not O
HUGE O
, O
but O
you O
are O
very O
full O
by O
the O
end O
of O
your O
meal B-AS
. O

we O
were O
full O
and O
ordered O
just O
coffee B-AS
and O
tea B-AS
, O
but O
the O
chef O
sent O
us O
some O
of O
his O
home O
made O
ice O
cream B-AS
, O
saying O
he O
couldnt O
send O
us O
home O
without O
trying O
any O
of O
his O
dessert B-AS
so O
that O
was O
the O
most O
unexpected O
part O
: O
lemongrass O
vanilla O
, O
five O
spices O
chinese B-AS
chocolat I-AS
( O
unbelivable O
) O
and O
coconut O
with O
citrus O
zests O
. O

I O
' O
m O
not O
sure O
how O
he O
' O
s O
managed O
to O
stay O
in O
the O
restaurant O
business O
for O
40 O
years O
with O
his O
attitude O
( O
and O
the O
food B-AS
' O
s O
not O
good O
enough O
to O
rate O
the O
Seinfeld B-AS
treatment O
) O
, O
but O
he O
' O
s O
definitely O
lost O
one O
customer O
for O
good O
! O

I O
don O
' O
t O
usually O
go O
there O
over O
the O
weekends O
or O
during O
prime B-AS
dinner I-AS
hours O
- O
- O
but O
for O
a O
weekday O
dinner O
it O
' O
s O
great O
, O
and O
I O
' O
ve O
never O
had O
any O
problems O
with O
crowds B-AS
, O
waiting B-AS
, O
or O
bad O
service B-AS
. O

All O
of O
the O
drinks B-AS
that O
we O
tried O
were O
As O
for O
desserts B-AS
, O
my O
favorite O
is O
the O
chocolate B-AS
cake I-AS
and O
my O
boyfriend O
really O
liked O
their O
pumpkin O
cheesecake B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
also O
good O
although O
there O
are O
a O
few O
kinks O
to O
work O
out O
- O
the O
soft B-AS
shell I-AS
crab I-AS
appetizer I-AS
wasn O
' O
t O
quite O
as O
' O
soft O
' O
as O
it O
should O
be O
and O
the O
halibut O
was O
a O
little O
too O
peppery O
, O
but O
my O
friend O
loved O
his O
cod B-AS
and O
said O
it O
was O
perfect O
. O

I O
can O
' O
t O
even O
remember O
if O
they O
serve O
anything O
else O
- O
- O
a O
busy O
hole O
in O
the O
wall O
sized O
place B-AS
and O
atmosphere B-AS
. O

The O
beginning O
of O
the O
meal O
wasnt O
bad O
, O
the O
hostess B-AS
was O
very O
nice O
, O
we O
got O
our O
drinks B-AS
about O
every O
10 O
minutes O
and O
the O
appetizers O
we O
good O
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
was O
nice O
once O
he O
got O
to O
us O
, O
it O
took O
about O
5 O
minutes O
to O
get O
a O
glass B-AS
of I-AS
water I-AS
and O
someone O
to O
get O
us O
started O
even O
though O
it O
was O
very O
slow O
. O

The O
whole B-AS
table I-AS
must O
participate O
and O
you O
have O
to O
be O
willing O
to O
let O
the O
chef B-AS
cook O
for O
you O
with O
no O
menu B-AS
. O

Great O
food B-AS
, O
but O
tiny O
portions B-AS
and O
inexcusable O
service B-AS
- O
disorganized O
, O
amateurish O
and O
definitely O
overpriced O
by O
a O
long O
shot O
. O

The O
signature O
of O
the O
Indian O
Tandoor O
- O
Oven O
chet O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
total O
absence O
of O
spices B-AS
The O
pakoras O
were O
somewhere O
between O
red O
and O
purple O
in O
color O
and O
dripping O
with O
oil B-AS
. O

The O
decor B-AS
in O
the O
dinin B-AS
room I-AS
is O
a O
bit O
bland O
, O
but O
the O
service B-AS
is O
always O
friendly O
. O

Don O
' O
t O
go O
for O
the O
decor B-AS
or O
the O
location B-AS
, O
go O
for O
the O
food B-AS
! O

Although O
the O
sides B-AS
at O
Lugers B-AS
are O
delicious O
( O
the O
bacon B-AS
is O
out O
of O
this O
world O
) O
the O
steak B-AS
is O
entirely O
priced B-AS
way O
too O
high O
. O

Our O
dinner O
special O
included O
dessert B-AS
, O
but O
our O
slow O
and O
unhelpful O
waitress B-AS
didn O
' O
t O
bother O
asking O
if O
we O
wanted O
any O
. O

The O
waitress B-AS
came O
to O
our O
table B-AS
and O
told O
us O
about O
their O
tempting O
specials B-AS
. O

I O
ordered O
chicken B-AS
vindaloo I-AS
, O
the O
delivery O
took O
about O
an O
hour O
, O
and O
it O
cost B-AS
me O
$ O
13 O
with O
tip O
. O

The O
best O
part O
of O
our O
dining O
experience O
was O
, O
when O
our O
burgers B-AS
were O
ordered O
with O
NOTHING O
on O
them O
, O
and O
they O
came O
with O
some O
mysterious O
Houston O
' O
s O
secret B-AS
hickory I-AS
sauce I-AS
! O

i O
think O
the O
$ O
5 O
dollar O
breakfast B-AS
is O
great O
hangover O
food O
, O
but O
then O
again O
, O
it O
' O
s O
hard O
to O
mess O
up O
eggs B-AS
, O
right O
? O

With O
5 O
items O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
and O
prices B-AS
this O
low O
, O
you O
' O
d O
think O
turnover O
would O
be O
a O
priority O
- O
- O
think O
again O
! O
! O
! O

The O
waiter B-AS
set O
down O
my O
companion O
' O
s O
meal B-AS
and O
didn O
' O
t O
return O
with O
my O
dish B-AS
for O
some O
time O
. O

There O
are O
decent O
selections B-AS
if O
you O
are O
a O
seafood B-AS
person O
, O
but O
not O
a O
lot O
if O
you O
aren O
' O
t O
! O

From O
the O
appetizers B-AS
to O
the O
spectacular O
and O
always O
improving O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
, O
to O
the O
delicious O
entrees B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
wonderful O
and O
reasonably O
priced B-AS
, O
( O
so O
hard O
to O
find O
in O
NY O
) O
and O
the O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
is O
very O
attentive O
and O
helpful O
when O
choosing O
an O
entree B-AS
. O

The O
menu B-AS
features O
mild O
versions O
of O
Lone O
Star O
state O
favorites O
, O
from O
double O
- O
basted O
baby B-AS
back I-AS
ribs I-AS
and O
steak O
fajitas O
to O
red B-AS
- I-AS
beef I-AS
chili I-AS
and O
deep B-AS
- I-AS
fried I-AS
onions I-AS
. O

Although O
Sweet O
Melissa B-AS
' O
s O
food B-AS
and O
pastries B-AS
are O
very O
tasty O
, O
the O
unfriendly O
folks O
who O
work O
there O
sour O
the O
experience B-AS
. O

The O
bean B-AS
burritos I-AS
and O
the O
cheese O
enchiladas O
are O
to O
die O
for O
and O
don O
' O
t O
get O
me O
started O
on O
their O
refried O
beans B-AS
. O

The O
drinks B-AS
are O
quite O
strong O
, O
so O
I O
recommend O
having O
one O
of O
their O
wines B-AS
by I-AS
the I-AS
glass I-AS
to I-AS
accompany O
dinner O
instead O
of O
a O
cocktail O
. O

The O
first O
time O
, O
the O
food O
was O
decent O
for O
lunch B-AS
, O
but O
remember O
mediocre O
service B-AS
. O

Our O
waitress B-AS
hardly O
spoken O
English O
- O
and O
not O
because O
she O
spoke O
French O
- O
and O
she O
spilled O
wine B-AS
all O
over O
me O
and O
didn O
' O
t O
try O
to O
make O
any O
amends O
. O

Just O
finished O
a O
tasty O
jerked B-AS
chicken I-AS
dinner I-AS
that O
was O
too O
pricey O
for O
the O
subpar O
service B-AS
and O
good O
, O
but O
not O
great O
food B-AS
. O

I O
often O
go O
to O
ISE O
for O
lunch B-AS
and O
I O
am O
always O
very O
happy O
with O
the O
food B-AS
. O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
ate O
dinner B-AS
there O
last O
weekend O
and O
the O
food B-AS
was O
very O
good O
, O
and O
very O
reasonably O
priced B-AS
, O
we O
thought O
. O

Our O
food B-AS
was O
delivered O
in O
a O
timely O
fashion O
but O
if O
you O
wanted O
another O
drink O
or O
your O
check B-AS
you O
had O
to O
hunt O
down O
your O
server O
. O

Teenie O
weenie O
overpriced O
appetizers B-AS
were O
served B-AS
at O
an O
agonizingly O
slow O
pace O
, O
one O
at O
a O
time O
30 O
minutes O
between O
each O
. O

We O
both O
got O
soup O
, O
and O
appetizer B-AS
, O
and O
a O
main O
course O
( O
fabulous O
duck B-AS
) O
, O
so O
we O
didnt O
have O
space O
for O
dessert B-AS
. O

Food B-AS
other O
than O
sushi B-AS
is O
also O
very O
nice O
. O

The O
portions B-AS
are O
now O
very O
small O
, O
the O
sauces O
are O
overly O
- O
ambitious O
usually O
inedible O
while O
the O
service B-AS
is O
still O
good O
, O
the O
restaurant O
, O
due O
to O
its O
popularity O
, O
seems O
frantic O
. O

Our O
waiter B-AS
was O
a O
real O
pro O
; O
knew O
a O
lot O
about O
ingredients B-AS
and O
allowed O
us O
to O
take O
our O
time O
. O

The O
place B-AS
wasn O
' O
t O
at O
all O
busy O
, O
and O
we O
were O
shown O
a O
table O
in O
the O
back O
, O
given O
our O
menus B-AS
, O
and O
promptly O
forgotten O
about O
. O

For O
dessert B-AS
you O
must O
try O
the O
baklava B-AS
, O
chocolate B-AS
mousse I-AS
cake I-AS
, O
strawberry B-AS
shortcake I-AS
. O

I O
have O
been O
to O
Blue O
Ribbon O
Sushi B-AS
at O
least O
75 O
times O
and O
have O
never O
ordered O
the O
same O
dish B-AS
twice O
, O
that O
' O
s O
how O
awesome O
the O
menu B-AS
is O
. O

I O
got O
there O
with O
my O
husband O
aspecting O
nothing O
but O
delicious O
landmark O
Italian B-AS
food I-AS
, O
instead O
, O
we O
got O
tasteless O
pizza O
, O
salty O
pasta B-AS
dishes I-AS
and O
over O
cooked O
Expensive O
prices O
, O
not O
compatible O
with O
the O
service B-AS
they O
offer O
. O

We O
had O
a O
great O
tiem O
watching O
the O
shows B-AS
and O
characters B-AS
and O
ar O
food B-AS
was O
just O
what O
we O
were O
looking O
for O
. O

This O
was O
followed O
by O
various O
wacky O
hijinks O
: O
overly O
sweet O
foie O
de O
gras O
, O
lack O
of O
extra O
ginger O
/ O
soy O
sauce O
, O
minute O
portions B-AS
even O
for O
sushi O
, O
appetizers B-AS
arriving O
at O
different O
times O
. O

We O
ordered O
a O
variety O
of O
appetizers B-AS
including O
the O
crabcakes O
, O
lobster B-AS
rolls I-AS
and I-AS
poached I-AS
shrimp I-AS
- O
- O
one O
was O
better O
than O
the O
next O
. O

I O
expected O
professionals O
, O
but O
was O
instead O
met O
with O
an O
amateur O
waitstaff B-AS
that O
made O
several O
ominous O
errors O
during O
the O
course O
of O
the O
meal B-AS
. O

We O
had O
a O
crab B-AS
and I-AS
roasted I-AS
red I-AS
pepper I-AS
dip I-AS
along O
with O
a O
beef B-AS
empinada O
for O
our O
appetizers B-AS
, O
which O
set O
the O
tone O
of O
delicious O
worldly B-AS
cuisine I-AS
that O
we O
were O
about O
to O
experience O
. O

Service B-AS
is O
one O
thing O
but O
a O
restaurant O
like O
Craft O
needs O
to O
have O
much O
better O
quality O
food B-AS
for O
the O
price O
they O
charge O
. O

I O
went O
there O
for O
lunch B-AS
with O
co O
- O
workers O
and O
found O
the O
service B-AS
to O
be O
prompt O
and O
very O
friendly O
. O

I O
went O
for O
lunch B-AS
and O
the O
staff B-AS
does O
not O
welcome O
you O
upon O
entering O
. O

There O
are O
specials O
and O
it O
' O
s O
the O
kind O
of O
place B-AS
sure O
to O
please O
, O
whether O
you O
' O
re O
seated O
at O
the O
window O
near O
the O
bar B-AS
or O
in O
the O
outdoor O
( O
covered O
heated O
when O
needed O
) O
garden O
in O
the O
rear O
. O

The O
Food B-AS
A O
good O
way O
to O
judge O
a O
Thai O
spot O
is O
by O
its O
green B-AS
curry I-AS
: O
The O
all O
- O
Thai O
staff B-AS
here O
fashions O
it O
spicy O
and O
smooth O
, O
filled O
to O
bursting O
with O
meat B-AS
and O
thin O
- O
sliced O
bamboo O
shoots B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
right O
out O
of O
heaven O
, O
arrive O
hungry O
because O
the O
portions B-AS
are O
huge O
but O
not O
the O
prices B-AS
. O

Even O
at O
lunch O
, O
when O
lawyers O
and O
publishers O
flock O
in O
to O
wheel O
and O
deal O
over O
the O
justly B-AS
- I-AS
popular I-AS
lunch I-AS
buffet I-AS
, O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
remains O
serene O
. O

And O
to O
end O
the O
meal B-AS
try O
some O
hazelnut O
gelato B-AS
. O

The O
menu B-AS
showcases O
Thai O
- O
French O
favorites O
: O
fresh O
chopped B-AS
hai I-AS
( I-AS
white I-AS
fish I-AS
) I-AS
and O

pork I-AS
, O
broccoli O

From O
having O
an O
appetizer B-AS
, O
a O
glass B-AS
of I-AS
wine I-AS
and O
reading O
a O
magazine O
to O
sitting O
by O
a O
table B-AS
to O
work O
on O
my O
grades O
, O
to O
meeting O
other O
fellow O
teachers O
for O
a O
book O
club O
to O
partying O
with O
the O
owners B-AS
all O
my O
experiences O
at O
Futura O
have O
always O
been O
extremely O
postive O
! O

Please O
try O
to O
order O
a O
dish B-AS
that O
is O
served O
with O
the O
corn B-AS
cake I-AS
. O

This O
past O
Memorial O
day O
weekend O
was O
hot O
and O
I O
asked O
the O
waiter B-AS
why O
was O
the O
air B-AS
condition O
not O
working O
and O
he O
responded O
doens O
' O
t O
know O
why O
. O

The O
place B-AS
was O
practically O
empty O
when O
my O
friends O
and O
I O
got O
there O
for O
dinner B-AS
. O

The O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
is O
short O
and O
the O
wine O
glasses O
suck O
( O
not O
spigleau O
or O
riedel O
, O
in O
addition O
they O
are O
small O
for O
the O
big O
italian B-AS
wines I-AS
on O
the O
menu B-AS
) O
. O

Its O
good O
to O
go O
there O
for O
drinks B-AS
if O
you O
don O
' O
t O
want O
to O
get O
drunk O
because O
you O
' O
ll O
be O
lucky O
if O
you O
can O
get O
one O
drink O
an O
hour O
the O
service B-AS
is O
so O
bad O
. O

We O
ate O
here O
once O
and O
the O
waiter B-AS
was O
very O
aggressive O
about O
pushing O
the O
specials O
instead O
of O
what O
was O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
. O

On O
the O
table B-AS
you O
will O
also O
find O
individual O
bottles O
of O
fine O
imported O
olive B-AS
oil I-AS
which O
we O
put O
on O
the O
bread O
- O
fantastic O
! O

Our O
group O
of O
8 O
had O
about O
five O
small O
plates B-AS
that O
we O
thought O
were O
the O
best O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
. O

the O
bread B-AS
they O
served B-AS
as O
we O
sat O
down O
had O
a O
pastry O
- O
like O
crunch O
on O
the O
outside O
and O
still O
warm O
. O

Buffet O
fare O
is O
better O
than O
the O
regular O
menu B-AS
and O
you O
don O
' O
t O
have O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
waitstaff B-AS
. O

The O
chef B-AS
insisted O
that O
the O
meat B-AS
was O
cooked O
properly O
! O
? O

With O
some O
good O
sake B-AS
, O
I O
tried O
the O
salmon B-AS
, O
yellowtail O
, O
king O
crab O
, O
eel O
( O
thought O
this O
would O
turn O
my O
stomach O
) O
, O
red O
white O
tuna O
. O

I O
have O
had O
some O
bad O
meals B-AS
in O
my O
day O
, O
but O
the O
way O
we O
were O
treated O
here O
, O
takes O
the O
cake B-AS
. O

Staple O
entrees B-AS
like O
moussaka O
more O
than O
make O
the O
grade O
, O
but O
the O
selection O
of O
clay O
pot O
- O
cooked O
dishes O
- O
- O
tender O
lamb B-AS
with I-AS
orzo I-AS
, O
or O
fish B-AS
of O
the O
day O
with O
eggplant B-AS
and I-AS
zucchini I-AS
- O
- O
take O
comfort B-AS
food I-AS
to O
a O
new O
level O
. O

This O
pizza B-AS
is O
the O
BEST O
anywhere O
for O
grandma B-AS
slices I-AS
! O

My O
date O
and O
I O
were O
excited O
to O
go O
, O
and O
didn O
' O
t O
even O
mind O
the O
25 O
minute O
wait B-AS
( O
EVEN O
WITH O
OUR O
RESERVATION B-AS
) O
to O
get O
a O
table B-AS
. O

Well O
on O
a O
friday O
or O
sat O
, O
i O
think O
this O
place B-AS
should O
take O
reservations B-AS
as O
it O
gets O
pretty O
busy O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
our O
waiter B-AS
set O
quite O
a O
different O
tone O
; O
he O
disappeared O
until O
the O
end O
of O
our O
meal B-AS
, O
when O
we O
had O
to O
beg O
for O
coffees O
and O
desserts B-AS
. O

the O
manager B-AS
will O
be O
very O
defensive O
and O
tell O
you O
the O
chef B-AS
, O
his O
brother O
, O
has O
not O
changed O
in O
4 O
years O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
consistantly O
great O
, O
but O
the O
wait B-AS
is O
often O
long O
and O
the O
noise O
is O
often O
deafening O
. O

the O
most O
expensive O
dish B-AS
on O
the O
menu B-AS
was O
$ O
14 O
! O
! O
! O

The O
manager B-AS
then O
told O
us O
we O
could O
order O
from O
whatever O
menu B-AS
we O
wanted O
but O
by O
that O
time O
we O
were O
so O
annoyed O
with O
the O
waiter B-AS
and O
the O
resturant O
that O
we O
let O
and O
went O
some O
place O
else O
. O

They O
also O
have O
great O
vegearian O
sushi B-AS
options I-AS
, O
try O
the O
AAC O
( O
avocado O
, O
asparagus B-AS
and I-AS
cucumber I-AS
) O
roll O
! O

The O
food B-AS
was O
very O
good O
, O
especially O
for O
the O
Restaurant O
Week O
menu O
price O
, O
although O
it O
seemed O
like O
the O
' O
hits O
' O
would O
be O
the O
ceviche B-AS
and O
other O
small O
dishes B-AS
that O
weren O
' O
t O
part O
of O
the O
menu O
. O

For O
dinner B-AS
: O
I O
always O
go O
for O
the O
fish B-AS
and O
it O
' O
s O
always O
cooked O
just O
right O
. O

When O
the O
hostess B-AS
finally O
appears O
she O
tells O
me O
that O
she O
can O
' O
t O
seat O
us O
on O
the O
mostly O
empty O
patio B-AS
because O
all O
the O
open B-AS
tables I-AS
are O
for O
dinner B-AS
not O
drinks B-AS
. O

An O
amazing O
combination O
of O
a O
place B-AS
to O
sit O
down O
with O
the O
family O
and O
have O
a O
good O
time O
or O
have O
a O
drink B-AS
at O
the O
bar B-AS
with O
some O
friends O
. O

My O
prefix B-AS
dinner I-AS
was O
composed O
of O
garlic B-AS
shrimp I-AS
appetizer I-AS
followed O
by O
a O
yummy O
skirt O
steak B-AS
complete O
with O
handcut O
fries B-AS
. O

Deborah O
, O
the O
chef B-AS
and O
co O
- O
owner O
, O
is O
an O
extraordinary O
talent O
- O
she O
has O
not O
received O
the O
notoriety O
she O
deserves O
- O
and O
her O
food B-AS
, O
while O
not O
expensive O
, O
really O
merits O
a O
two O
or O
three O
star O
rating O
. O

Friendly O
staff B-AS
happily O
accepted O
a O
reservation B-AS
( O
for O
10 O
) O
, O
and O
when O
only O
6 O
showed O
up O
, O
they O
couldn O
' O
t O
have O
been O
more O
understanding O
! O

We O
should O
have O
had O
the O
entire O
restaurant O
, O
but O
the O
manager B-AS
let O
some O
random O
lady O
sit O
up O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
because O
she O
was O
a O
regular O
. O

mistake O
on O
the O
check B-AS
, O
overly O
salty O
morels O
stuffed O
with O
foie O
gras O
) O
but O
overall O
, O
Daniel O
' O
s O
dishes B-AS
are O
revelations O
in O
taste O
. O

A O
special O
appetizer O
called O
Vegetable B-AS
Carpaccio I-AS
with O
Salmon B-AS
was O
delicious O
. O

The O
manager B-AS
refused O
to O
talk O
to O
me O
sending O
the O
waiter B-AS
to O
tell O
me O
to O
tell O
me O
that O
he O
was O
not O
available O
, O
when O
I O
had O
previously O
seen O
him O
doing O
absolutely O
nothing O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
average O
and O
the O
service B-AS
is O
insulting O
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
accidently O
spilled O
water B-AS
on O
our O
table B-AS
, O
and O
the O
manager B-AS
checked O
up O
on O
our O
meal B-AS
periodically O
and O
offered O
us O
a O
free O
after O
diner B-AS
drink I-AS
. O

Last O
night O
the O
dining B-AS
room I-AS
was O
crammed O
and O
seemingly O
only O
had O
one O
waiter B-AS
which O
is O
ludicrous O
. O

It O
is O
so O
difficult O
to O
choose O
a O
favorite O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
because O
the O
bolognese O
, O
the O
salmon B-AS
, O
the O
chicken B-AS
with I-AS
mushroom I-AS
, O
and O
the O
telephono B-AS
are O
all O
too O
good O
to O
rank O
. O

Amarin O
' O
s O
food B-AS
is O
always O
fresh O
, O
although O
the O
quality B-AS
does O
vary O
- O
- O
avoid O
ordering O
on O
Friday O
Saturday O
nights O
, O
prime O
dining O
hours O
, O
when O
they O
seem O
to O
throw O
things O
togehter O
a O
little O
too O
haphazardly O
. O

We O
tried O
to O
place O
the O
order O
and O
the O
waiter B-AS
had O
no O
clue O
what O
we O
wanted O
even O
though O
we O
pointed O
it O
out O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
. O

One O
of O
the O
waitstaff B-AS
spilled O
a O
huge O
drink B-AS
on O
the O
floor O
that O
splattered O
everyone O
nearby O
, O
no O
offering O
of O
apology O
was O
made O
or O
to O
foot O
the O
drycleaning B-AS
bill I-AS
and O
no O
comp O
was O
offered O
either O
. O

We O
arrived O
, O
were O
greeeted O
and O
sked O
by O
the O
hostess B-AS
I O
think O
if O
we O
were O
there O
for O
the O
Brunch B-AS
, O
that O
was O
starting O
up O
again O
on O
today O
( O
3 O
/ O
12 O
) O
the O
cost O
$ O
25 O
per O
person O
. O

And O
after O
we O
ordered O
our O
food B-AS
, O
their O
wine O
guy O
suggested O
the O
wine O
that O
he O
thought O
would O
go O
best O
with O
our O
selections O
, O
and O
it O
was O
surprisingly O
not O
a O
high O
- O
priced O
bottle B-AS
. O

Ordered O
a O
beer B-AS
from O
the O
bartender B-AS
, O
she O
opened O
it O
and O
the O
told O
me O
that O
she O
didn O
' O
t O
know O
the O
price O
! O
! O

Nice O
decor B-AS
poor O
food B-AS
poor O
service B-AS
. O

Went O
to O
dinner B-AS
for O
a O
law O
firm O
recruiting O
event O
, O
and O
the O
service B-AS
was O
abysmal O
. O

She O
also O
has O
to O
beg O
for O
water B-AS
refills O
squeeze O
her O
smallish O
rear O
- O
end O
between O
crowded O
tables B-AS
. O

Appetizers B-AS
were O
good O
- O
we O
had O
the O
scallops B-AS
and O
a O
salad B-AS
. O

Also O
, O
neither O
our O
waiter B-AS
or O
busboy O
ever O
came O
back O
to O
ask O
if O
we O
wanted O
more O
to O
drink B-AS
or O
even O
refill O
our O
WATER B-AS
glasses I-AS
. O

The O
restaurant O
has O
a O
modern O
look O
with O
remarkable O
tables B-AS

Servers B-AS
struggle O
to O
explain O
the O
menu B-AS
to O
those O
who O
can O
' O
t O
tell O
an O
idli O
from O
a O
chapathi O
, O
but O
the O
mostly O
Indian O
clientele O
is O
completely O
at O
home O
with O
the O
vegetarian O
South O
Indian O
fare O
. O

They O
brought O
my O
mother O
a O
chicken O
enchiladas O
instead O
of O
cheese B-AS
and O
then O
it O
took O
her O
10 O
minutes O
to O
explain O
what O
the O
error O
was O
to O
the O
waiter B-AS
and O
bus O
boy O
who O
then O
finally O
had O
to O
tell O
the O
manager B-AS
who O
was O
also O
confused O
and O
my O
mother O
is O
fluent O
in O
Spanish O
. O

we O
ordered O
filets O
, O
and O
ny O
steaks B-AS
eventhough O
our O
waiter B-AS
kept O
pushing O
up O
to O
get O
the O
porterhouse O
. O

The O
House B-AS
salad I-AS
is O
big O
enough O
to O
split O
, O
The O
Fried B-AS
Calamari I-AS
is O
some O
of O
the O
best O
I O
ever O
ate O

The O

kept O
coming O
and O
we O
were O
having O
such O
a O
great O
time O
, O
we O
didn O
' O
t O
realize O
our O
entree B-AS
still O
had O
not O

- O
not O
too O
thick O
or O
doughy O
. O

Called O
to O
make O
a O
reservation B-AS
and O
b O
/ O
c O
the O
man B-AS
who O
answered O
was O
so O
nice O
decided O
to O
chance O
it O
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
seemed O
truly O
disinterested O
( O
he O
forgot O
to O
bring O
the O
bread B-AS
basket O
and O
the O
wine B-AS
was O
served B-AS
after O
he O
delivered O
the O
entrees O
. O

After O
arriving O
we O
were O
told O
to O
wait O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
, O
where O
there O
wasn O
' O
t O
an O
inch O
of O
space B-AS
so O
we O
remained O
in O
the O
tiny O
area O
near O
the O
coat O
check O
. O

The O
waitress B-AS
even O
gave O
us O
a O
complimentary O
dessert O
- O
warm O
chocolate O
lava O
cake O
with O
a O
scoop O
of O
cinnamon O
ice B-AS
cream I-AS
, O
what O
a O
perfect O
end O
to O
a O
perfect O
dinner O
! O

Once O
the O
waitress B-AS
cursed O
our O
table B-AS
for O
not O
tipping O
enough O
after O
we O
had O
waited O
an O
hour O
to O
order O
and O
another O
half O
an O
hour O
just O
to O
get O
a O
drink B-AS
, O
on O
top O
of O
this O
I O
had O
to O
find O
my O
own O
cutlery O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
equally O
outstanding O
: O
I O
had O
the O
fois B-AS
gras I-AS
and O
rack B-AS
of I-AS
lamb I-AS
, O
along O
with O
the O
Brooklyn O
Bridge O
for O
dessert O
. O

We O
started O
with O
some O
drinks O
on O
the O
front O
porch O
and O
then O
continued O
at O
our O
table B-AS
with O
a O
bottle O
of O
delicious O
red O
wine B-AS
. O

It O
also O
has O
great O
ice O
cream B-AS
and O
spumoni O
ices B-AS
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
' O
s O
knowledge O
of O
the O
menu B-AS
and O
ability O
to O
make O
recommendations O
were O
ridiculously O
bad O
, O
requests O
weren O
' O
t O
observed O
effectively O
, O
and O
our O
water B-AS
and I-AS
wine I-AS
glasses I-AS
were O
not O
kept O
full O
. O

They O
have O
Boylan O
' O
s O
root B-AS
beer I-AS
, O
coffee B-AS
that O
' O
s O
freshly O
ground B-AS
that O
day O
, O
and O
a O
relaxed O
casual O
atmosphere B-AS
with O
friendly O
waitresses B-AS
. O

We O
had O
the O
Margarita B-AS
pizza I-AS
, O
calamari B-AS
appetizer I-AS
, O
salmon B-AS
entree I-AS
and O
the O
tira O
misu O
for O
dessert B-AS
. O

On O
ouor O
visit O
, O
our O
reservation B-AS
was O
ignored O
and O
then O
we O
were O
asked O
to O
move O
from O
our O
seats B-AS
at O
the O
bar B-AS
, O
where O
we O
were O
told O
to O
wait O
, O
because O
we O
were O
not O
drinking O
enough O
. O

Love O
the O
pizza O
here O
( O
although O
the O
slices B-AS
aren O
' O
t O
as O
fresh O
at O
3am O
, O
but O
who O
' O
s O
that O
picky O
when O
you O
' O
re O
drunk O
) O
, O
and O
there O
' O
s O
plenty O
of O
other O
good O
stuff B-AS
. O

These O
guys O
do O
not O
skimp O
on O
drinks B-AS
or O
quality B-AS
of O
food B-AS
. O

The O
party B-AS
space I-AS
worked O
out O
well O
for O
our O
rehearsal O
dinner B-AS
. O

The O
menu B-AS
is O
informatively O
presented O
with O
facts O
about O
the O
ingredients B-AS
, O
and O
is O
divided O
into O
Starting O
and O
Sharing O
plates O
, O
which O
allows O
one O
to O
sample O
a O
few O
items O
during O
the O
meal O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
slow O
( O
20 O
minutes O
wait O
time O
before O
they O
came O
back O
with O
our O
drinks B-AS
, O
not O
including O
10 O
minute O
wait O
for O
them O
to O
take O
our O
drink O
order O
) O
. O

I O
am O
allergic O
to O
certain O
types O
of O
foods B-AS
and O
he O
was O
very O
knowledgeable O
about O
the O
menu B-AS
and O
brought O
our O
drinks B-AS
and O
food O
very O
fast O
. O

Atmosphere B-AS
in O
the O
formal O
room O
was O
nice O
, O
but O
the O
informal B-AS
dining I-AS
room I-AS
was O
extremely O
loud O
which O
ultimately O
made O
the O
formal O
room O
louder O
than O
my O
perference O
. O

The O
goat B-AS
cheese I-AS
and O
sun B-AS
dried I-AS
tomato I-AS
ravioli I-AS
is O
great O
, O
the O
bread B-AS
may O
be O
a O
little O
weak O
, O
but O
the O
calamari B-AS
is O
nice O
. O

The O
manager B-AS
was O
very O
thoughtful O
to O
have O
the O
chef B-AS
make O
me O
a O
dish O
not O
on O
the O
menu O
to O
my O
liking O
. O

mapQuest O
before O
you O
go O
and O
you O
' O
ll O
arrive O
early O
enough O
start O
off O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
with O
a O
fabulous O
old O
school B-AS
cocktail I-AS
. O

The O
wait B-AS
could O
be O
long O
because O
of O
the O
limited O
number O
of O
seats O
but O
it O
is O
worth O
it O
, O
especially O
if O
you O
leave O
your O
cell O
phone O
# O
with O
them O
and O
go O
off O
for O
a O
drink B-AS
at O
any O
one O
fo O
the O

, O
like O

Even O
though O
it O
' O

a O
trek O
for O
me O
to O
get O
there O
and O
the O
place B-AS
is O
a O

in O

I O
' O
ve O
gone O
many O
times O
for O
the O
food B-AS
alone O
. O

But O
overall O
loved O
the O
place O
, O
outside O
of O
our O
waiter B-AS
who O
literally O
tried O
to O
force O
us O
into O
ordering O
drinks B-AS

Ambiance B-AS

the O

like O
they O
might O
force O
us O

The O
service B-AS
is O
more O
than O
attentive O
, O
and O
they O
also O
have O
a O
$ O
10 O
corking O
fee O
so O
you O
can O
bring O
your O
own O

My O
greek O

and O
for O
that O
price B-AS

I O
would O
not O

olive I-AS
( O
as O
opposed O
to O
whole O

and O
shredded O

since O
it O
is O
kinda O
small O
less O
than O
20 O
tables B-AS
, O
but O
room O
downstairs B-AS
for O
private O
parties O
. O

they O
waited O
to O
get O
us O
water O
after O
they O
took O
our O
food B-AS
orders O
, O
which O
took O
the O
waitstaff B-AS
a O
long O
time O
to O
do O
. O

the O
manager B-AS
said O
that O
they O
were O
just O
starting O
with O
a O
preview O
menu B-AS
. O

The O
bartender B-AS
virtually O
ignored O
us O
while O
we O
waited O
, O
took O
15 O
minutes O
to O
get O
drinks B-AS
. O

Needless O
to O
say O
I O
will O
rather O
go O
spend O
$ O
400 O
on O
dinner B-AS
somewhere O
else O
wirh O
better O
service B-AS
. O

Thankfully O
, O
the O
steak B-AS
was O
good O
, O
but O
the O
food B-AS
couldn O
' O
t O
save O
the O
restaurant O
from O
a O
bad O
rating O
. O

Decor B-AS
is O
simple O
yet O
functional O
and O
although O
the O
staff B-AS
are O
not O
the O
most O
attentive O
in O
the O
world O
, O
you O
don O
' O
t O
feel O
rushed O
and O
the O
food B-AS
is O
good O
, O
hot O
with O
decent O
portion B-AS
sizes O
and O
a O
good O
selection O
to O
suit O
most O
tastes O
. O

Expect O
to O
get O
average O
food B-AS
, O
a O
big O
bill B-AS
and O
lots O
of O
attitude O
from O
the O
service O
. O

It O
' O
s O
in O
a O
less O
travelled O
spot B-AS
on O
3rd O
, O
but O
the O
intimate O
setting B-AS
is O
great O
and O
romantic O
. O

etc O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
lacking O
a O
bit O
, O
we O
waited O
about O
20 O
mins O
for O
a O
waiter O
and O
water O
to O
come O
to O
us O
once O
we O
were O
sat O
and O
we O
had O
to O
ask O
for O
everything O
twice O
, O
even O
drink B-AS
orders O
- O
I O
think O
maybe O
we O
just O
got O
stuck O
with O
a O
bad O
waiter O
though O
. O

Fresh O
fish B-AS
, O
tender O
milk O
fed O
veal O
and O
outrageous O
Veal O
Chops O
adorn O
their O
menu B-AS
and O
special O
list B-AS
. O

They O
served O
the O
main O
course O
before O
the O
appetizers B-AS
eventhough O
we O
asked O
for O
the O
latter O
first O
, O
to O
which O
our O
waiter B-AS
responded O
that O
they O
don O
' O
t O
serve O
them O
separately O
without O
telling O
us O
beforehand O
while O
ordering O
. O

Pupusas O
, O
filled O
with O
pork O
, O
beans B-AS
, O
chicken B-AS
or O
cheese O
, O
are O
sumptuous O
pancakes B-AS
bursting O
with O
the O
flavor B-AS
of O
fresh O
corn O
. O

Chef B-AS
Anthony O
is O
warm O
and O
is O
always O
fixing O
up O
something O
unique O
and O
tasty O
in O
the O
kitchen O
to O
send O
to O
your O
table B-AS
. O

Our O
appetizers B-AS
arrived O
soon O
after O
, O
and O
a O
few O
minutes O
later O
were O
followed O
by O
our O
main O
courses B-AS
. O

My O
reservation B-AS
for O
2 O
was O
during O
lunch B-AS
and O
it O
seemed O
that O
because O
I O
was O
literally O
2 O
minutes O
late O
, O
the O
hostess B-AS
felt O
the O
need O
to O
seat O
every O
party O
before O
mine O
. O

The O
garden B-AS
is O
lovely O
, O
too O
, O
but O
the O
staff B-AS
seems O
a O
bit O
condescending O
. O

Customers O
MUST O
order O
one O
entre O
each O
if O
dining B-AS
outdoors I-AS
, O
they O
will O
not O
seat B-AS
you O
unless O
your O
entire O
group O
is O
present O
( O
nor O
will O
they O
hold O
a O
table O
) O
and O
they O
make O
it O
clear O
that O
they O
want O
to O
turn O
tables O
. O

Though O
the O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
was O
attentive O
, O
when O
the O
raw O
( O
really O
, O
not O
al O
dente O
) O
potatoes B-AS
were O
brought O
to O
our O
server O
' O
s O
attention O
, O
she O
listened O
but O
didn O
' O
t O
respond O
. O

I O
loved O
my O
kimchee O
stew B-AS
with O
bits O
of O
shredded B-AS
pork I-AS
and O
just O
enough O
hotness O
to O
clear O
the O
sinuses O
, O
but O
not O
kill O
all O
other O
flavors O
. O

However O
the O
casual O
atmosphere B-AS
comes O
in O
handy O
if O
you O
want O
a O
good O
place O
to O
drop O
in O
and O
get O
food B-AS
. O

When O
we O
showed O
up O
at O
the O
restaurant O
, O
the O
manager B-AS
claimed O
that O
I O
made O
reservation B-AS
for O
TWO O
instead O
of O
TEN O
and O
flat O
out O
told O
us O
we O
don O
' O
t O
seat O
that O
many O
and O
refused O
to O
even O
apologize O
for O
the O
miss O
communication B-AS
. O

The O
menu B-AS
offered O
unique O
options O
and O
my O
friends O
enjoyed O
their O
food O
, O
but O
my O
lentil B-AS
avacado I-AS
salad I-AS
was O
not O
better O
or O
more O
interesting O
than O
the O
lunch B-AS
counter I-AS
at O
Saks O
and O
my O
John O
Dory O
was O
overcooked O
. O

If O
you O
are O
a O
person O
who O
wants O
perfect O
service B-AS
, O
you O
should O
probably O
skip O
it O
, O
you O
may O
wait O
for O
your O
server B-AS
to O
sing O
a O
song O
before O
you O
get O
your O
drinks O
but O
that O
is O
half O
the O
fun O
. O

My O
favorite O
part O
of O
dinner B-AS
was O
the O
Oyster B-AS

The O
bar B-AS
seemed O
like O
a O
good O
place B-AS
to O
sit O
and O
have O
some O
food O
as O
we O
were O
not O
even O
offered O
a O
table O
. O

When O
we O
proceeded O
to O
order O
our O
food B-AS
, O
the O
waitress B-AS
interrupted O
and O
told O
us O
that O
maybe O
we O
had O
ordered O
enough O
for O
now O
. O

Walked O

Year O
Sunday O
late O
in O
the O
afternoon O
, O
around O
5 O
or O
6 O
- O
- O
seating B-AS
was O
not O
a O
problem O
the O
dim O
sum O
was O
deliciously O
fresh O
- O
- O
very O
likely O
a O
by O
- O
product O
of O
their O
not O
using O
carts B-AS
. O

Never O
will O
you O
taste O
sicilian B-AS
Pizza I-AS
and O
Spumoni O
like O
LBs B-AS
. O

Get O
a O
Big O
beer B-AS
to O
wash O
it O
all O
down O
and O
a O
side O
of O
potatoes O
and O
garlic B-AS
bread I-AS
. O

Do O
not O
use O
this O
place O
unless O
you O
want O
to O
waste O
your O
money O
on O
horrible O
stale O
cheese B-AS
and O
food O
, O
service O
which O
takes O
your O
drinks B-AS
away O
from O
the O
table O
once O
you O
' O
ve O
placed O
it O
on O
the O
table O
, O
waiters B-AS
that O
eat O
your O
desert O
while O
its O
on O
the O
table O
, O
non O
working O
faucets O
in O
the O
bathroom B-AS
, O
and O
overall O
very O
unporfessional O
service O
and O
food O
. O

The O
owner B-AS
was O
rude O
to O
us O
from O
the O
moment O
we O
sat O
down O
until O
he O
told O
us O
we O
had O
to O
leave O
because O
he O
had O
another O
table O
waiting O
, O
and O
this O
despite O
ordering O
the O
pricier O
entrees O
from O
the O
menu B-AS
and O
a O
bottle O
of O
wine O
that O
we O
hadn O
' O
t O
yet O
finished O
. O

When O
we O
finally O
ordered O
our O
wine O
, O
the O
waitress B-AS
brought O
the O
bottle B-AS
of I-AS
wine I-AS
over O
with O
ONE O
GLASS O
MISSING O
- O
meaning O
, O
we O
' O
d O
have O
to O
wait O
even O
longer O
for O
the O
final O
glass O
to O
arrive O
- O
which O
were O
all O
piping O
hot O
from O
the O
dishwasher O
. O

While O
the O
drinks B-AS
didn O
' O
t O
come O
in O
large O
glasses O
and O
the O
arepas B-AS
were O
not O
large O
in O
size O
, O
they O
had O
a O
taste B-AS
about O
them O
that O
made O
you O
only O
want O
more O
. O

Don O
' O
t O
expect O
trendy O
atmosphere B-AS
: O
room O
looks O
like O
it O
could O
have O
been O
designed O
in O
1940s O
, O
but O
who O
cares O
- O
it O
' O
s O
actually O
comfortable O
and O
inviting O
; O
with O
great O
food B-AS
and O
unbeatable O
value B-AS
, O
you O
can O
' O
t O
go O
wrong O
. O

As O
for O
price B-AS
, O
there O
are O
plenty O
of O
Shanghai O
restaurants O
in O
Chinatown O
that O
are O
just O
as O
inexpensive O
with O
better O
food B-AS
and O
without O
a O
doubt O
much O
better O
customer O
service B-AS
. O

Also O
, O
the O
staff B-AS
will O
not O
allow O
you O
to O
substitute O
a O
side O
dish O
or O
accommodate O
anything O
that O
differs O
from O
what O
' O
s O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
. O

Interestingly O
, O
cost B-AS
only O
becomes O
truly O
apparent O
when O
dinner B-AS
is O
over O
, O
as O
there O
is O
no O
menu O
before O
that O
presented O
for O
deserts O
. O

When O
one O
compares O
the O
quality B-AS
of I-AS
the I-AS
food I-AS
to O
some O
of O
the O
city O
' O
s O
other O
italian O
restaurants O
, O
and O
then O
particularly O
when O
one O
factors O
in O
the O
very O
reasonable O
prices B-AS
here O
, O
I O
feel O
that O
this O
restaurant O
comes O
out O
a O
winner O
. O

The O
Egg B-AS
and I-AS
Cheese I-AS
on O
a O
bagel B-AS
here O
is O
HUGE O
. O

The O
first O
time O
I O
went O
, O
and O
was O
completely O
taken O
by O
the O
live B-AS
jazz I-AS
band I-AS
and O
atmosphere B-AS
, O
I O
ordered O
the O
Lobster B-AS
Cobb I-AS
Salad I-AS
. O

The O
menu B-AS
might O
have O
well O
been O
written O
in O
a O
foreign O
language O
and O
the O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
didnt O
have O
a O
translation O
dictionary O
! O

My O
party O
of O
8 O
had O
a O
seafood B-AS
feast O
sampling O
Sammy O
' O
s O
menu B-AS
and O
we O
couldn O
' O
t O
believe O
how O
great O
the O
food B-AS
was O
. O

Our O
server B-AS
didn O
' O
t O
have O
the O
sommelier O
stop O
by O
when O
we O
were O
trying O
to O
decide O
on O
wines B-AS
, O
he O
never O
brought O
the O
bread O
we O
requested O
and O
didn O
' O
t O
crack O
a O
smile O
the O
whole O
evening O
until O
he O
saw O
that O
I O
was O
paying O
the O
tab O
when O
he O
suddenly O
became O
nicer O
. O

But O
if O
you O
' O
re O
looking O
for O
a O
fun O
time O
at O
a O
place O
that O
isnt O
trying O
so O
hard O
to O
be O
the O
next O
it O
place O
, O
then O
just O
hang O
at O
rice B-AS
to O
riches O
instead O
where O
they O
actually O
value O
their O
patrons B-AS
and O
dont O
make O
you O
wait O
. O

our O
appetizers B-AS
came O
out O
relatively O
quickly O
, O
but O
it O
was O
near O
impossible O
to O
get O
a O
hold O
of O
a O
waiter B-AS
to O
order O
and O
get O
our O
drinks B-AS
. O

The O
entertainment B-AS
was O
great O
they O
have O
shows B-AS
that O
go O
on O
through O
out O
the O
dinner O
. O

Portions B-AS
were O
certainly O
substantial O
for O
lunch B-AS
. O

The O
menu B-AS
of O
Afghani O
favorites O
includes O
mantoo O
, O
the O
spicy O
beef O
dumplings O
in O
yogurt O
sauce O
; O
chicken O
with O
walnuts O
and O
pomegranate O
juice O
; O
saffron O

grilled B-AS
Cornish I-AS
game O
hen B-AS
; O
meat O
and O
fish B-AS
kebabs I-AS
in O
various O
combinations O
; O
and O
a O
number O
of O
vegetarian O
rice O
- O
and O
bean O
- O
based O
dishes B-AS
. O

The O
restaurant O
has O
a O
somewhat O
unique O
decor B-AS
, O
with O
portrait O
of O
the O
owner B-AS
meditating O
and O
books O
about O
meditation O
. O

Their O
cappuccino O
' O
s O
are O
served B-AS
in O
a O
generous O
mug O
with O
a O
bit O
too O
much O
milk B-AS
and O
too O
- O
sudsy O
foam O
. O

The O
waiters B-AS
do O
not O
tell O
you O
that O
and O
our O
large O
party O
wound O
up O
with O
over O
$ O
100 O
extra O
food O
because O
all O
members O
thought O
dessert B-AS
, O
coffee B-AS
/ I-AS
tea I-AS
were O
included O
- O
which O
they O
lead O
you O
to O
believe O
- O
and O
they O
weren O
' O
t O
. O

My O
friends O
and O
I O
tried O
practically O
every O
strange O
, O
inventive O
dish B-AS
on O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
most O
of O
which O
are O
very O
tasty O
. O

Apple B-AS
sourdough I-AS
pie I-AS
, O
and O
orange B-AS
cake I-AS
are O
good O
, O
as O
is O
the O
bundt B-AS
cake I-AS
with O
a O
rich O
chocolaty O
filling O
and O
the O
cupcakes O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
not O
terrible O
but O
with O
the O
prices B-AS
as O
high O
as O
they O
are O
, O
I O
should O
expect O
better O
. O

When O
she O
wasn O
' O
t O
being O
sarcastic O
or O
downright O
rude O
, O
she O
spent O
her O
time O
studiously O
ignoring O
our O
table B-AS
or O
pointing O
us O
out O
to O
the O
other O
waitstaff B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
worth O
going O
for O
, O
but O
the O
boys O
in O
behind O
the O
bar B-AS
in O
the O
lounge O
are O
what O
keep O
me O
coming O
back O
! O

For O
entrees O
, O
the O
Ground B-AS
Lamb I-AS
in I-AS
Spicy I-AS
Sauce I-AS
( O
can O
' O
t O
remember O
the O
name O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
) O
was O
perfectly O
cooked O
and O
had O
just O
enough O
kick O
for O
the O
average O
person O
. O

why O
go O
there O
to O
deal O
with O
staffs B-AS
' O
attitude B-AS
and O
eat O
bad O
food B-AS
? O

The O
owner B-AS
sat O
with O
us O
and O
asked O
us O
what O
fish B-AS
we O
liked O
and O
prepared O
an O
entree B-AS
for O
each O
of O
us O
with O
an O
array O
of O
seafood B-AS
. O

After O
dinner B-AS
I O
thanked O
the O
bartender B-AS
and O
told O
him O
how O
this O
was O
the O
only O
good O
French B-AS
food I-AS
we O
had O
found O
in O
Manhattan O
. O

Because O
its O
kindly O
sushi B-AS
chief O
and O
his O
co O
- O
worker O
, O
it O
makes O
me O
want O
to O
have O
my O
dinner B-AS
there O
all O
the O
time O
. O

We O
were O
seated O
quickly O
( O
and O
had O
reservations B-AS
, O
but O
they O
didnt O
seem O
to O
be O
absolutely O
necessary O
) O
and O
our O
waitress B-AS
offered O
much O
insight O
into O
menu B-AS
bests O
and O
worsts O
. O

In O
the O
20 O
minutes O
we O
spent O
waiting O
just O
for O
a O
server B-AS
to O
take O
our O
wine B-AS
order O
, O
the O
host B-AS
of O
this O
establishment O
proceeded O
to O
let O
couple O
after O
couple O
walk O
right O
in O
in O
- O
front O
of O
us O
because O
he O
obviously O
knew O
them O
. O

B O
/ O
c O
the O
dinner O
focused O
on O
good O
friends O
and O
good O
food B-AS
, O
not O
waiting O
around O
for O
service B-AS
or O
being O
bothered O
by O
rude O
staff B-AS
to O
leave O
. O

Then O
we O
were O
led O
downstairs O
to O
the O
main O
room O
, O
and O
were O
seated B-AS
at O
the O
huge O
communal O
dining B-AS
room I-AS
table I-AS
. O

the O
waiter B-AS
was O
unable O
to O
identify O
whether O
certain O
cheeses B-AS
from O
the B-AS
cheese I-AS
course I-AS
were O
cow O
or O
goat O
milk O
. O

Some O
advice O
: O
have O
the O
prime B-AS
rib I-AS
if O
it O
is O
a O
special O
, O
try O
a O
price O
fix O
lunch O
or O
dinner B-AS
because O
it O
is O
an O
exceptional O
value O
. O

I O
had O
spicy O
halibut B-AS
with O
some O
sauces B-AS
I O
can O
' O
t O
remember O
. O

We O
ordered O
the O
Tuna B-AS
a I-AS
la I-AS
carte I-AS
and O
Wild B-AS
Salmon I-AS
and I-AS
chicken I-AS
breast I-AS
on O
the O
Prix B-AS
Fixe I-AS
. O

great O
trendy O
spot B-AS
for O
a O
night O
out O
but O
to O
be O
honest O
the O
food B-AS
was O
not O
worth O
the O
cost O
. O

Food B-AS
was O
fine O
, O
and O
the O
place B-AS
is O
pretty O
cool O
, O
but O
the O
waitstaff B-AS
was O
slow O
and O
pretty O
clueless O
. O

Be O
prepared O
to O
sip O
the O
finest O
wines O
and O
dine B-AS
on O
such O
splendid O
flavors B-AS
as O
the O
Torellini O
Bottega O
( O
hand O
- O
made O
tortellini B-AS
filled I-AS
with I-AS
prosciutto I-AS
, O
veal O
and O
beef B-AS
in I-AS
a I-AS
porcini I-AS
- I-AS
butter I-AS
sauce I-AS
- O
- O
it O
is O
to O
die O
for O
! O

The O
service B-AS
wasn O
' O
t O
good O
- O
- O
dumplings B-AS
were O
served B-AS
after O
we O
had O
almost O
finished O
the O
main B-AS
courses I-AS
, O
drinks B-AS
had O
to O
be O
asked O
for O
three O
times O
, O
etc O
. O

The O
staff B-AS
is O
cool O
and O
friendly O
, O
and O
the O
place B-AS
has O
been O
around O
since O
J O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
horrendous O
, O
not O
only O
did O
the O
waiter B-AS
take O
an O
hour O
to O
remember O
we O
ordered O
drinks B-AS
, O
we O
were O
rushed O
to O
eat O
and O
get O
out O
so O
they O
could O
seat O
the O
next O
party O
. O

There O
' O
s O
very O
little O
on O
their O
menu B-AS
if O
you O
' O
re O
trying O
to O
avoid O
cheese O
and O
oil B-AS
- O
not O
many O
grilled O
entrees O
at O
all O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
good O
, O
but O
it O
' O
s O
not O
worth O
the O
wait B-AS
- O
- O
or O
the O
lousy O
service B-AS
. O

The O
problem O
was O
that O
we O
waited O
for O
a O
long O
time O
to O
get O
our O
waitress B-AS
, O
we O
had O
to O
ask O
the O
bus O
boy O
for O
refills O
for O
drinks B-AS
, O
and O
we O
waited O
for O
a O
long O
time O
to O
pay O
for O
our O
check O
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
didn O
' O
t O
go O
over O
the O
menu B-AS
choices I-AS
and O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
night O
we O
were O
so O
fed O
up O
we O
didn O
' O
t O
even O
order O
dessert B-AS
. O

And O
the O
ambience B-AS
is O
very O
cool O
, O
stop O
by O
on O
a O
Saturday O
afternoon O
and O
you O
can O
play O
some O
old O
school O
games O
while O
having O
a O
beer B-AS
. O

yes O
as O
I O
sat O
at O
the O
table B-AS
waiting I-AS
just O
under O
1 O
HOUR O
for O
my O
food O
, O
i O
was O
quite O
tempted O
to O
step O
across O
the O
road O
for O
a O
quick O
snack B-AS
. O

The O
waitstaff B-AS
brought O
us O
so O
many O
free O
tapas B-AS
( O
chilled O
mussels O
, O
spare O
ribs B-AS
, O
chorizo O
, O
sauteed O
shrimp O
) O
along O
with O
our O
house B-AS
salad I-AS
and O
bread B-AS
that O
we O
barely O
had O
room O
for O
the O
entrees B-AS
. O

When O
we O
arrived O
there O
was O
no O
free O
table B-AS
so O
we O
waited O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
for O
quite O
a O
long O
time O
. O

Our O
waitress B-AS
( O
and O
the O
chef B-AS
himself O
) O
helped O
us O
a O
bit O
with O
the O
Austrian B-AS
cuisine I-AS
where O
we O
had O
questions O
, O
and O
every O
recommendation O
was O
right O
on O
. O

The O
waitress B-AS
came O
back O
with O
the O
bill O
and O
money B-AS
( O
with O
a O
calculator O
) O
and O
asked O
for O
more O
tips O
. O

Classic O
seafood B-AS
offerings I-AS
include O
lobster B-AS
tails I-AS
, I-AS
steamed I-AS
crab I-AS
legs I-AS
and O
wild B-AS
Alaskan I-AS
salmon I-AS
; O
sides B-AS
, O
served O
a O
la O
carte O
, O
include O
baked O
potato O
and O
chipotle O
mac O
and O
cheese O
. O

Italian O
cheesecake B-AS
, O
Cassata O
Al O
Forno O
and O
pastries B-AS
you O
never O
saw O
in O
other O
bakeries O
are O
great O
. O

Anyway O
after O
witnessing O
the O
owner B-AS
abusing O
some O
of O
the O
staff B-AS
and O
scarfing O
down O
the O
college O
dorm O
made O
pasta B-AS
we O
left O
; O
the O
momentum O
of O
the O
night O
gone O
we O
were O
all O
drained O
from O
the O
bad O
dining B-AS
experience O
and O
just O
went O
home O
. O

When O
I O
tried O
getting O
a O
lunch B-AS
order O
delivered O
, O
I O
was O
told O
I O
was O
out O
of O
the O
delivery B-AS
range I-AS
( O
strange O
since O
I O
am O
also O
located O
in O
the O
East O
Village O
) O
. O

I O

to O

even O
my O

we O

to O
sit O
in O
our O
own O
little O
world O
eating O
tons O
of O
good O
sushi B-AS
! O

The O
food B-AS
was O
good O
but O
we O
were O
dissatisfied O
with O
waiting B-AS
too O
long O
for O
a O
uncomfortable O
table O
. O

The O
bartender O
informed O
me O
the O
place B-AS
was O
full O
, O
and O
the O
wait B-AS
was O
30 O
minutes O
. O

The O
Food B-AS
The O

Italian I-AS
menu I-AS
forgoes O
the O

in O
favor O
of O
fairly O
priced B-AS
small O
plates B-AS
, O
which O
quickly O
add O
up O

Huge O
selection O
of O
farm B-AS
roasted I-AS
coffee I-AS
served I-AS
with O
a O
smile O
, O
absolutely O
no O
attitude B-AS
, O
and O
accompanied O
with O
the O
best O
pastries B-AS
in O
Manhattan O
. O

We O
tried O
the O
Tasting O
menu B-AS
' O
, O
and O
the O
manager B-AS
offered O
to O
select O
the O
items O
to O
be O
served B-AS
after O
taking O
inputs O
from O
us O
( O
Choice O
of O
meat O
, O
allergies O
etc O
. O

The O
manager B-AS
also O
refused O
to O
remove O
the O
drink B-AS
from O
the O
check O
, O
suggesting O
that O
if O
we O
didnt O
like O
it O
, O
we O
could O
simply O
remove O
the O
corn O
ourselves O
. O

Well O
, O
the O
manager B-AS
rudely O
informed O
us O
that O
this O
was O
how O
the O
food B-AS
is O
supposed O
to O
be O
served O
( O
one O
course O
every O
30 O
or O
so O
minutes O
) O
and O
then O
claimed O
that O
Oliva O
is O
NOT O
a O
tapas O
restaurant O
. O

The O
lengthy B-AS
menu I-AS
includes O
the O
likes O
of O

I O
haven O
' O
t O
tried O
a O
lot O
of O
their O
menu B-AS
however O
their O
appitizers B-AS
are O
tasty O
and O
fairly O
priced B-AS
. O

the O
waiter B-AS
never O
asked O
if O
we O
would O
like O
more O
drinks B-AS
, O
we O
had O
to O
flag O
him O
down O
and O
ask O
him O
and O
then O
when O
he O
brought O
them O
he O
forget O
two O
of O
them O
. O

We O
let O
the O
very O
kind O
hostess B-AS
know O
we O
were O
there O
and O
had O
some O
drinks B-AS
at O
the O
bar O
. O

A O
bit O
noisy O
at O
street O
for O
the O
hospital O
a O
block O
away O
, O
but O
relaxing O
for O
drinks B-AS
or O
appetizers B-AS
( O
Ceviche O
, O
Croquetas B-AS
, O
Empanas O
, O
Serrano O
Pizza O
, O
Calamar O
) O
and O
a O
BIG O

for O
the O
main B-AS
entrees I-AS
( O
Argentinian O
Steak O
, O
Pata O
Chancho O
, O
Salmon B-AS
) O
. O

We O
asked O
the O
chef B-AS
if O
it O
was O
possible O
to O
have O
two O
different O
tasting O
menus B-AS
, O
to O
which O
he O
was O
quick O
and O
eager O
to O
comply O
. O

The O
server B-AS
rolled O
his O
eyes O
when O
we O
ordered O
only O
an O
entree B-AS
per O
person O
( O
with O
no O
appetizers B-AS
) O
, O
spoke O
curtly O
to O
us O
, O
and O
ignored O
our O
requests O
for O
more O
water O
etc O
. O

It O
was O
topped O
with O
pan B-AS
roasted I-AS
new I-AS
onions I-AS
and O
it O
lent O
the O
meat B-AS
a O
great O
flavor B-AS
. O

I O
was O
told O
by O
the O
hostess B-AS
that O
a O
specific B-AS
table I-AS
would O
be O
mine O
once O
the O
customers O
left O
and O
I O
waited O
45 O
minutes O
for O
that O
to O
happen O
. O

After O
finally O
choosing O
banana O
- O
macadamia O
nut O
pancakes O
( O
a O
Hawaiian O
favorite O
of O
mine O
) O
after O
being O
unable O
to O
decide O
between O
4 O
or O
5 O
dishes B-AS
that O
all O
sounded O
spectacular O
, O
I O
sat O
back O
and O
enjoyed O
the O
( O
complementary O
) O
tall O
shot O
glass B-AS
of O
the O
smoothie O
of O
the O
day O
. O

A O
server B-AS
came O
shortly O
after O
that O
with O
a O
cheeseburger B-AS
, O
which O
is O
not O
what O
i O
ordered O
. O

I O
especially O
recommend O
ordering O
the O
duck B-AS
, I-AS
foie I-AS
gras I-AS
, O
and O
beef B-AS
cheeks O
although O
it O
' O
s O
probably O
hard O
to O
go O
wrong O
with O
anything O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
. O

I O
would O
not O
recommend O
this O
place O
until O
they O
get O
a O
new B-AS
staff I-AS
that O
can O
complement O
the O
food B-AS
. O

07 O
menu O
was O
a O
deal O
to O
try O
this O
hip O
tribeca O
restaurant O
but O
the O
wrong O
dessert B-AS
was O
sent O
to O
the O
table B-AS
. O

We O
tried O
the O
duck B-AS
quesadilla I-AS
( O
good O
) O
, O
a O
house O
special O
maki B-AS
roll I-AS
( O
nothing O
special O
) O
, O
salmon B-AS
3 O
ways O
( O
dry O
+ O
overcooked O
) O
, O
and O
jumbo O
prawns O
( O
super O
salty O
) O
. O

The O
menu B-AS
contains I-AS
both O
Japanese B-AS
fusion I-AS
and O
plain O
Italian B-AS
dishes I-AS
- O
everyone O
should O
be O
able O
to O
find O
something O
they O
like O
. O

Rather O
you O
are O
paying O
rock O
bottom O
price B-AS
for O
a O
meal B-AS
that O
could O
cost B-AS
you O
triple O
any O
where O
else O
. O

The O
menu B-AS
offers O
a O
lineup O
of O
USDA O
prime O
steaks O
at O
higher O
- O
end O
prices B-AS
paired O
with O
sides B-AS
such O
as O
crab B-AS
cakes I-AS
, O
fried B-AS
oysters I-AS
and I-AS
onion I-AS
rings I-AS
. O

A O
blink O
- O
and O
- O
you O
- O
missed O
, O
tiny O
bar B-AS
lines O
the O
lefthand O
side O
wall O
as O
you O
enter O
, O
which O
is O
packed O
with O
neighborhood O
hipsters O
, O
but O
it O
sadly O
interferes O
with O
the O
tables B-AS
filled I-AS
with I-AS
dining I-AS
patrons I-AS
that O
are O
forking O
out O
mega O
bucks O
for O
mediocre O
fare B-AS
. O

When O
I O
got O
the O
bill O
and O
saw O
I O
was O
billed O
separately O
for O
each O
cup B-AS
of O
coffee B-AS
, O
I O
asked O
the O
waiter O
if O
he O
could O
do O
anything O
since O
the O
menu B-AS
doesn O
' O
t O
even O
list O
drinks B-AS
and O
the O
manager B-AS
said O
no O
. O

Only O
con O
was O
the O
cost B-AS
- O
- O
our O
dinner B-AS
for O
two O
was O
$ O
400 O
! O

When O
I O
went O
in O
for O
dinner B-AS
this O
Sunday O
, O
after O
a O
2 O
month O
absence O
, O
I O
noticed O
their O
addition O
of O
table B-AS
cloths I-AS
, O
which O
really O
add O
to O
the O
ambiance O
and O
I O
noticed O
that O
their O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
has O
been O
expanded O
. O

Paying O
that O
high O
price B-AS
, O
I O
could O
have O
dined O
at O
other O
places O
with O
better O
food B-AS
and O
service O
. O

i O
' O
ve O
ordered O
a O
cheese B-AS
plate O
there O
, O
too O
- O
the O
kitchen B-AS
makes O
it O
for O
you O
even O
though O
it O
' O
s O
not O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
! O

I O
politely O
asked O
the O
waitress B-AS
to O
explain O
these O
charges O
noting O
that O
the O
menu B-AS
was O
misleading O
and O
she O
got O
frustrated O
mad O
and O
then O
told O
her O
manager B-AS
. O

The O
Scene B-AS
Rows O

the O
busboys O
were O
fantastic O
- O
- O
very O
attentive O
when O
it O
came O
to O
replenishing O
chips B-AS
, O
removing O
dishes B-AS
, O
but O
I O
have O
to O
say O
the O
waitress B-AS
service I-AS
was O
not O
quite O
as O
good O
. O

While O
waiting O
we O
asked O
the O
bartender B-AS
for O
at O
glass B-AS
of I-AS
red I-AS
wine I-AS
which O
he O
not O
only O
forgot O
to O
serve O
but O
when O
we O
asked O
him O
again O
10min O
later O
he O
poured O
us O
white O
wine O
. O

when O
I O
came O
back O
for O
brunch B-AS
a O
week O
or O
so O
later O
, O
I O
was O
told O
that O
the O
marscapone B-AS
version I-AS
was O
no O
longer O
being O
served B-AS
, O
because O
there O
was O
a O
new O
cook B-AS
. O

For O
breakfast B-AS
, O
thick O
, O
fluffy O
brioche B-AS
French I-AS
toast I-AS
, O
served O
with O
maple O
butter O
and O
fresh O
berries O
, O
excels O
; O
likewise O
, O
a O
clever O
sandwich B-AS
of I-AS
scrambled I-AS
eggs I-AS
and I-AS
tomato I-AS
jam I-AS
in O
a O
light O
, O
salty O
buttermilk O
biscuit B-AS
. O

It O
' O
s O
got O
above O
- O
average O
diner B-AS
and O
italian O
fare B-AS
, O
and O
it O
' O
s O
right O
near O
the O
subway O
. O

I O
thought O
the O
bar O
was O
fair O
in O
terms O
of O
decor B-AS
, O
but O
how O
long O
do O
you O
have O
wait O
at O
the O
bar O
before O
a O
bartender B-AS
with O
an O
attitude O
( O
he O
wasn O
' O
t O
rude O
, O
but O
not O
friendly O
) O
makes O
you O
an O
awful O
drink B-AS
, O
but O
food O
was O
delightful O
and O
music B-AS
light O
and O
tasty O
as O
well O
. O

Food B-AS
was O
ok O
, O
but O
not O
worth O
the O
1 O
hour O
wait O
( O
we O
sat O
down O
an O
hour O
after O
our O
reservation B-AS
time O
) O
If O
you O
are O
going O
to O
make O
people O
wait O
a O
LONG O
time O
, O
then O
at O
least O
build O
a O
bigger O
bar B-AS
. O

Xunta O
' O
s O
tapas B-AS
dishes I-AS
were O
great O
though O
a O
little O
pricey O
for O
small O
plates B-AS
. O

Our O
waiter B-AS
, O
though O
he O
was O
charming O
, O
was O
too O
busy O
to O
truly O
take O
care O
of O
us O
properly O
and O
the O
food B-AS
was O
over O
priced O
. O

When O
your O
overzealous B-AS
kitchen I-AS
brings O
out O
the O
food O
all O
at O
once O
way O
too O
quickly O
how O
about O
apologizing O
and O
have O
the O
manager B-AS
come O
over O
. O

The O
dinner B-AS
special I-AS
is O
amazing O
, O
although O
I O
would O
pick O
the O
meat B-AS
option O
rather O
than O
seafood B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
, O
though O
good O
for O
the O
most O
part O
( O
very O
good O
duck O
and O
chicken O
with O
rice O
dish O
, O
but O
awful O
charred B-AS
squid I-AS
salad I-AS
- O
tasted O
bitter O
going O
down O
) O
, O
was O
the O
least O
memorable O
part O
of O
the O
meal B-AS
. O

The O
place B-AS
wasn O
' O
t O
packed O
, O
but O
there O
was O
a O
bar B-AS
scene I-AS
and O
a O
few O
salsa O
dancers O
who O
strutted O
their O
stuff O
on O
the O
dancefloor O
. O

The O
host B-AS
actually O
came O
over O
to O
my O
table B-AS
and O
told O
me O
and O
my O
date O
we O
had O
to O
leave O
because O
we O
already O
paid O
our O
bill B-AS
. O

We O
ordered O
one O
of O
the O
specials B-AS
our O
decent O
waiter B-AS
mentioned O
, O
and O
one O
of O
the O
chicken B-AS
dishes I-AS
off O
the O
menu B-AS
. O

My O
husband O
doesn O
' O
t O
like O
vegetables B-AS
and O
made O
a O
point O
to O
ask O
the O
waiter B-AS
if O
he O
could O
have O
a O
side O
of O
pasta B-AS
instead O
. O

The O
singing B-AS
wait I-AS
staff I-AS
are O
great O
, O
the O
food B-AS
is O
just O
awful O
! O
! O

The O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
was O
better O
the O
second O
time O
around O
and O
our O
water B-AS
glasses I-AS
were O
always O
full O
. O

( O
The O
booths O
remained O
unoccupied O
throughout O
our O
meal B-AS
, O
unless O
you O
count O
the O
not O
- O
very O
- O
busy O
waitstaff B-AS
. O

I O
went O
for O
an O
early O
dinner B-AS
the O
other O
night O
and O
encountered O
the O
worst O
service B-AS
i O
have O
experienced O
in O
a O
long O
time O
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
placed O
the O
wrong O
entree B-AS
in O
front O
of O
us O
each O
time O
. O

Sometimes O
people O
get O
up O
and O
dance O
, O
overall O
a O
pretty O
fun O
spot B-AS
, O
although O
the O
crowd B-AS
does O
tend O
to O
be O
over O
30 O
. O

All O
dishes B-AS
are O
an O
incredible O
dining O
experience B-AS
. O

I O
had O
calamari O
for O
appetizer B-AS
which O
was O
fried O
to O
a O
golden O
crisp O
not O
overdone O
, O
and O
a O
veal B-AS
for I-AS
main I-AS
course I-AS
with O
a O
side O
of O
pumpkin O
ravioli O
which O
was O
absolutely O
to O
die O
for O
. O

An O
unpretentious O
sexy O
atmosphere B-AS
lends O
itself O
to O
the O
above O
average O
wine O
- O
list O
and O
a O
menu B-AS
that O
can O
stand O
- O
up O
to O
any O
other O
restaurant O
in O
NewYork O
City O
( O
or O
Paris O
) O
. O

I O
will O
say O
that O
often O
times O
they O
make O
their O
drinks B-AS
very O
strong O
( O
may O
tell O
your O
bartender B-AS
/ O
waitress B-AS
to O
keep O
it O
mild O
) O
. O

the O
2 O
tables O
next O
us O
had O
undercooked O
beans B-AS
, O
tough O
hanger B-AS
steak I-AS
, O
mediocre O
dessert B-AS
and O
same O
vibe B-AS
about O
the O
chicken B-AS
. O

The O
bar B-AS
had O
a O
hip O
DJ B-AS
and O
the O
crowd B-AS
was O
ultra O
chic O
. O

I O
' O
m O
not O
a O
big O
dessert B-AS
fan O
, O
but O
I O
met O
a O
friend O
for O
a O
drink B-AS
there O
the O
other O
night O
and O
we O
found O
it O
cuz O
it O
was O
really O
cozy O
looking O
packed O
with O
people O
. O

The O
Crystal B-AS
Ballroom O
was O
closed O
for O
a O
private O
party O
, O
so O
we O
couldn O
' O
t O
even O
enjoy O
the O
decor B-AS
. O

do O
not O
take O
the O
reservation B-AS
at O
8pm O
to O
begin O
with O
, O
if O
in O
reality O
the O
management B-AS
knows O
that O
it O
will O
be O
impossible O
to O
seat O
at O
that O
time O
. O

The O
drinks B-AS
are O
cute O
as O
is O
concept O
- O
- O
unfortunately O
, O
the O
service B-AS
is O
not O
and O
neither O
is O
the O
wait B-AS
. O

There O
are O
only O
8 O
- O
10 O
tables B-AS
, O
so O
you O
receive O
a O
lot O
of O
attention O
from O
the O
waiters B-AS
, O
which O
is O
good O
. O

The O
food B-AS
could O
be O
better O
, O
the O
ambience B-AS
is O
loud O
and O
unwelcoming O
during O
lunch B-AS
, O
and O
the O
service B-AS
is O
not O
only O
inattentive O
but O
also O
disgusting O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
nice O
, O
although O
our O
food B-AS
took O
longer O
than O
usual O
to O
arrive O
because O
it O
had O
been O
brought O
to O
the O
wrong O
table B-AS
and O
accidently O
eaten O
. O

The O

The O
best O

Italian I-AS

service B-AS
( O
Menu O
? O

As O
for O
the O
food B-AS
, O
it O
is O
way O
too O
rich O
/ O
greasy O
, O
whether O
it O
was O
the O
calamari O
or O
grilled B-AS
chicken I-AS
. O

My O
party O
did O
not O
love O
the O
meats O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
maybe O
the O
pork B-AS
dumplings I-AS
but O
nothing O
else O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
really O
bad O
at O
several O
points O
our O
waiter B-AS
would O
just O
leave O
for O
a O
cigarette O
for O
like O
10 O
minutes O
while O
we O
waited O
for O
him O
to O
get O
us O
another O
drink B-AS
or O
even O
pay O
the O
bill B-AS
. O

Tiny O
slices B-AS
of O
pie B-AS
with O
a O
dribble O
of O
cream B-AS
topped O
off O
the O
evening O
. O

Best O
plan O
is O
to O
order O
more O
appetizers B-AS
and O
get O
one O
sushi B-AS
platter I-AS
. O

The O
food O
and O
drinks B-AS
held O
up O
to O
eatery O
' O
s O
rep O
and O
the O
service B-AS
was O
just O
as O
good O
if O
not O
better O
. O

Our O
waiter B-AS
was O
a O
bit O
weird O
as O
well O
, O
but O
the O
lounge B-AS
area I-AS
looked O
like O
a O
nice O
place O
to O
get O
a O
drink B-AS
after O
work O
. O

Yuckity B-AS
Yuck O
Yuck O
The O
Burritos O
were O
horrible O
but O
the O
Sangria B-AS
was O
decent O
. O

This O
is O
the O
only O
place O
that O
has O
great O
cheesecake B-AS
in O
the O
Tri O
State O
area B-AS
and O
they O
are O
famous O
for O
it O
. O

The O
bar B-AS
area I-AS
got O
a O
little O
too O
crowded O
but O
the O
ambiance B-AS
was O
great O
. O

Extensive O
menu B-AS
plenty O
of O
dishes B-AS
to O
choose O
from O
my O
dinner B-AS
was O
so O
- O
so O
but O
my O
BF O
entree O
was O
delicious O
. O

Had O
a O
late B-AS
- I-AS
night I-AS
dinner I-AS
there O
on O
Friday O
, O
and O
while O
the O
decor B-AS
is O
fabulous O
, O
we O
waited O
a O
long O
time O
for O
our O
check O
. O

After O
being O
seated O
the O
waiter B-AS
was O
prompt O
with O
coffee B-AS
and O
taking O
my O
order O
. O

Upon O
reading O
the O
$ O
44 O
prix B-AS
fixe I-AS
menu I-AS
( O
a O
fair O
price B-AS
for O
good O
food B-AS
) O
, O
we O
realized O
half O
of O
the O
Appetizers B-AS
and O
Entrees O
required O
an O
additional O
supplement O
ranging O
from O
five O
dollars O
to O
$ O
105 O
! O

The O
drinks B-AS
were O
really O
good O
- O
albeit O
a O
bit O
weird O
served B-AS
out O
of O
baby B-AS
bottles I-AS
. O

If O
you O
are O
under O
24 O
this O
might O
seem O
to O
be O
a O
great O
place O
in O
the O
big O
city O
but O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
us O
it O
' O
s O
just O
a O
liitle O
too O
chheesy O
and O
the O
food B-AS
is O
under O
par O
for O
the O
price B-AS
. O

i O
had O
the O
smallest B-AS
martini I-AS
, O
which O
the O
waiter B-AS
spilled O
part O
of O
. O

The O
Food B-AS
The O
Korean O
dishes O
here O
are O
a O
bit O
more O
delicate O
than O
the O
potent O
fare O
found O
30 O
blocks O
north O
, O
but O
the O
kitchen B-AS
is O
hardly O
pulling O
its O
punches O
. O

Although O
the O
food B-AS
was O
good O
, O
it O
wasn O
' O
t O
quite O
worth O
the O
price O
tag B-AS
. O

Simple O
Italian O
fare O
, O
with O
an O
emphasis O
on O
familiar O
pastas O
, O
include O
My O
Father O
' O

Style O
Rigatoni O
, O
served O
with O
thick O
slices B-AS
of I-AS
sausage I-AS
and O
veal B-AS
meatballs I-AS
. O

I O
had O
a O
reservation B-AS
for O
a O
Staurday O
night O
and O
after O
a O
1 O
hour O
and O
45 O
minute O
wait B-AS
, O
we O
still O
were O
not O
seated O
! O
! O

Oh O
, O
but O
on O
a O
brighter O
note O
, O
when O
the O
waiter B-AS
poured O
water O
into O
my O
vodka B-AS
glass I-AS
by O
mistake O
, O
we O
got O
a O
free O
drink O
out O
of O
it O
. O

Don O
' O
t O
expect O
to O
be O
filled O
up O
by O
one O
small O
dish B-AS
, O
you O
should O
order O
a O
few O
, O
or O
a O
combination O
, O
if O
you O
are O
eating O
dinner B-AS
. O

We O
sat O
in O
the O
garden B-AS
out O
back O
, O
and O
the O
calm O
atmosphere B-AS
with O
the O
waterfall O
rock O
wall O
on O
the O
side O
completed O
the O
setting B-AS
. O

Based O
on O
the O
menu O
prices O
, O
the O
value B-AS
of O
the O
buffet O
is O
made O
up O
before O
you O
even O
hit O
the O
buffet O
with O
the O
appetizers B-AS
that O
are O
served O
to O
the O
table O
. O

The O
small B-AS
shrimp I-AS
were O
dry O
and O
rubbery O
and O
when O
I O
sent O
the O
dish B-AS
back O
to O
the O
kitchen B-AS
, O
the O
waitress B-AS
returned O
saying O
that O
they O
use O
' O
frozen O
shrimp O
so O
that O
is O
wny O
they O
have O
that O
texture O
. O

The O
waitress B-AS
had O
zero O
knowledge O
about O
wine B-AS
, O
and O
even O
knowledge O
about O
the O
dishes O
they O
were O
serving O
. O

Every O
course B-AS
was O
delicious O
, O
including O
the O
multiple B-AS
chef I-AS
samples O
, O
brought O
to O
you O
from O
the O
chef O
throughout O
your O
entire O
meal B-AS
. O

It O
took O
a O
long O
time O
for O
the O
waiter B-AS
to O
bring O
the O
check B-AS
and O
we O
had O
to O
flag O
him O
down O
. O

The O
Scene B-AS
The O
main B-AS
dining I-AS
room I-AS
of O
this O
boisterous O
Carnegie O
Hall O
restaurant O
, O
dubbed O
the O
New B-AS
York I-AS
Room I-AS
, O
is O
a O
cavernous O
space B-AS
with O
high O
ceilings O
and O
sweeping O
glass O
windows O
. O

While O
the O
hostess B-AS
claimed O
to O
have O
lost O
my O
reservation B-AS
, O
we O
were O
there O
early O
enough O
to O
only O
have O
to O
wait O
about O
10 O
minutes O
to O
seat O
our O
party O
of O
seven O
. O

Be O
warned O
- O
between O
the O
pizza B-AS
and O
spumoni O
the O
place B-AS
is O
packed O
nightly O
in O
the O
summer O
. O

They O
ran O
out O
of O
the O
drinks B-AS
my O
friends O
ordered O
, O
but O
the O
staff B-AS
was O
eager O
- O
to O
- O
please O
and O
much O
appreciated O
. O

Lastly O
, O
after O
spending O
a O
little O
over O
an O
hour O
and O
most O
of O
that O
time O
waiting O
for O
our O
food O
to O
arrive O
the O
manager B-AS
barked O
at O
us O
to O
leave O
to O
make O
room B-AS
for O
another O
party O
that O
had O
been O
waiting O
for O
25 O
minutes O
! O

same O
atmosphere B-AS
but O
food O
was O
better O
before O
years O
ago O
- O
octopus O
was O
like O
chewing O
a O
rubber O
tire O
- O
dumplings B-AS
tasted O
artificial O
. O

I O
have O
tolerated O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
place B-AS
is O
packed O
on O
weekends O
, O
pricey O
and O
not O
that O
great O
drinks B-AS
, O
often O
poor O
music O
on O
Saturdays O
, O
and O
bottle O
service O
that O
is O
slowly O
turning O
into O
a O
must O
. O

The O
meal B-AS
was O
improperly O
served B-AS
. O

Beer B-AS
selection I-AS
is O
a O
bit O
slim O
, O
but O
seats O
are O
plentiful O
and O
there O
are O
several O
sports O
monitors O
placed O
about O
the O
bar B-AS
. O

Although O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
was O
lacking O
, O
I O
could O
definitely O
recommend O
a O
trip O
to O
Esca O
for O
the O
fish B-AS
alone O
! O

The O
waiter B-AS
was O
knowledgable O
about O
the O
menu B-AS
and O
spirits O
, O
and O
guided O
me O
to O
all O
the O
right O
items O
to O
order O
given O
my O
budget O
and O
occasion O
. O

On O
the O
night O
I O
went O
to O
Yakiniku O
Juju O
, O
my O
plate O
came O
first O
wet O
, O
then O
streaked O
with O
grease O
; O
the O
waitress B-AS
brought O
the O
wrong O
beer B-AS
, O
smeared O
the O
grill B-AS
with I-AS
pork I-AS
fat O
despite O
our O
having O
indicated O
that O
some O
in O
our O
party O
were O
on O
a O
kosher O
diet O
, O
and O
the O
music B-AS
was O
recycled O
three O
times O
. O

The O
space B-AS
is O
a O
bit O
cramped O
and O
the O
waitress B-AS
seemed O
to O
avoid O
eye O
contact O
at O
all O
costs O
, O
however O
, O
I O
would O
recommend O
you O
go O
just O
for O
the O
food B-AS
. O

From O
the O
goat B-AS
cheese I-AS
and O
caperberry O
dish B-AS
to O
hangar O
steak B-AS
to O
pancottas O
, O
the O
food B-AS
was O
amazing O
! O

Chances O
are O
the O
garden O
out O
back O
is O
hopping O
, O
with O
happy O
Slopers B-AS
sipping I-AS
wines I-AS
that O
start O
less O
than O
$ O
20 O
per O
bottle B-AS
and O
munching O
on O
more O
than O
a O
dozen O
kinds O
of O
pressed O
sandwiches B-AS
. O

The O
waitress B-AS
only O
stopped O
at O
our O
table B-AS
to O
take O
our O
order O
and O
pick O
up O
the O
check B-AS
. O

Two O
people O
having O
a O
multi B-AS
- I-AS
course I-AS
dinner I-AS
in O
Midtown O
Manhattan O
involving O
excellent O
food B-AS
and O
it O
all O
came O
in O
under O
$ O
50 O
! O
! O
! O

At O
this O
level O
, O
I O
want O
my O
servers B-AS
to O
know O
more O
than O
me O
about O
the O
food B-AS
and O
I O
didn O
' O
t O
get O
that O
sense O
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
comes O
over O
and O
says O
You O
changed O
the O
salad B-AS
and O
made O
us O
throw O
it O
out O
! O

my O
table B-AS
of O
four O
was O
not O
totaly O
neglected O
, O
but O
there O
was O
a O
lag O
in O
how O
promptly O
we O
were O
being O
served B-AS
. O

Warming O
clam B-AS
miso I-AS
soup I-AS
and O
expertly O
rolled O
Mexican O
maki O
( O
made O
with O
yellowtail O
, O
scallions B-AS
, O
avocado B-AS
, O
and B-AS
jalapeno I-AS
mayonnaise I-AS
) O
pair O
well O
with O
a O
stiff O
glass B-AS
of O
shochu B-AS
, O
Japanese O
liquor O
with O
a O
bite O
as O
strong O
as O
tequila B-AS
. O

The O
menu B-AS
is O
limited O
but O
good O
with O
rice B-AS
paper O
rolls O
being O
a O
house O
specialty O
. O

They O
weren O
' O
t O
exagerating O
when O
they O
called O
it O
Baku O
Palace O
, O
because O
the O
place B-AS
is O
huge O
, O
having O
the O
potential O
to O
accomodate O
weddings O
, O
bar B-AS
mitzvas O
or O
any O
other O
large O
parties O
while O
still O
serving O
other O
guests O
who O
prefer O
to O
dine O
outside O
the O
main O
room O
. O

Other O
reviews O
complain O
about O
portions B-AS
, O
it O
' O
s O
a O
TASTING O
menu O
not O
a O
Time O
' O
s O
Square O
buffet B-AS
. O

My O
dinner B-AS
partner O
loved O
some O
dishes B-AS
even O
when O
they O
were O
too O
hot O
for O
her O
taste O
. O

We O
actually O
gave O
10 O
% O
tip B-AS
( O
which O
we O
have O
never O
done O
despite O
mediocre O
food B-AS
and O
service O
) O
, O
because O
we O
felt O
totally O
ripped O
off O
. O

While O
the O
food B-AS
was O
good O
, O
service B-AS
tried O
way O
too O
hard O
. O

Every O
item O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
tasted O
like O
it O
had O
been O
lovingly O
perfected O
- O
from O
the O
pulled O
pork O
sandwich O
on O
white O
roll O
to O
the O
smokey B-AS
baked I-AS
beans I-AS
, O
buttery O
mac O
- O
n O
- O
cheese O
, O
and O
slightly O
spicey O
coleslaw B-AS
. O

I O
was O
thinking O
I O
am O
gonna O
have O
a O
nice O
dinner B-AS
in O
that O
place O
that O
a O
friend O
of O
mine O
recommended O
to O
me O
, O
but O
beside O
the O
expensive O
prices B-AS
that O
it O
has O
was O
nothing O
more O
. O

We O
had O
to O
ask O
for O
bread O
after O
45 O
minutes O
and O
even O
though O
our O
waiter B-AS
was O
GREAT O
, O
he O
had O
to O
ask O
the O
stiff O
manager B-AS
to O
comp O
us O
a O
round O
of O
drinks B-AS
for O
waiting B-AS
so O
long O
. O

It O
' O
s O
got O
funky O
, O
fun O
furniture B-AS
and O
a O
round O
bar O
at O
the O
front O
, O
which O
is O
convenient O
for O
those O
waiting O
to O
be O
seated O
and O
be O
prepared O
to O
wait O
for O
a O
while O
, O
if O
you O
don O
' O

have O
reservations B-AS

the O
new O
look O
for O

is O
amaizing O
and O
the O
food B-AS
is O
just O
getting O
better O
and O
better O
i O
had O
a O
blast O
of O
a O

The O
bartendars B-AS
are O
very O
friendly O
and O
at O

you O

I O
do O
not O
understand O
how O
this O
place O
can O
stay O
in O
business O
with O
its O
prices O
and O
quality B-AS
of O
food B-AS

My O

than O
the O

John O

to O

in O
the O
Great O

the O

too O
close O
to O
the O

which O
gets O
really O
crowded O
since O
it O

The O

sippers O
and O
snackers O
, O
and O
the O
rustic B-AS
- I-AS
chic I-AS
dining I-AS
room I-AS
, O
with O
brick O
arches O
that O
open O
onto O
a O
tight O
sidewalk O
terrazza O
, O
is O
booked O
weeks O
in O
advance O
. O

Took O
my O
girlfriend O
here O
for O
dinner B-AS
on O
a O
friday O
night O
, O
we O
were O
seated B-AS
promptly O
and O
the O
service B-AS
continued O
to O
be O
good O
for O
the O
remainder O
of O
the O
evening O
. O

It O
took O
the O
waiter B-AS
over O
a O
1 O
/ O
2 O
hour O
to O
come O
over O
to O
tell O
us O
the O
specials B-AS
. O

Our O
food B-AS
took O
so O
long O
to O
be O
served B-AS
that O
we O
nearly O
missed O
our O
curtain B-AS
. O

You O
can O
only O
sit O
on O
the O
stools O
with O
a O
slice O
, O
as O
the O
main B-AS
dining I-AS
area I-AS
downstairs O
is O
for O
real O
food B-AS
. O

Food B-AS
- O
mostly O
steak O
and O
fish O
- O
is O
decent O
, O
but O
the O
portions B-AS
are O
obscene O
- O
filet B-AS
mignon I-AS
and O
salmon O
were O
HUGE O
, O
but O
they O
don O
' O
t O
come O
with O
any O
side O
dishes O
- O
you O
have O
to O
order O
and O
pay O
extra O
for O
them O
which O
is O
inconvenient O
and O
expensive O
. O

If O
you O
can O
get O
service B-AS
, O
you O
might O
enjoy O
the O
surroundings O
- O
especially O
the O
upstairs O
lounge B-AS
. O

I O
would O
say O
it O
' O
s O
suitable O
for O
a O
romantic O
date O
or O
quiet O
family B-AS
meal I-AS
, O
as O
there O
is O
no O
bar B-AS
so O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
a O
little O
quiet O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
ben O
waiting B-AS
to O
try O
Al O
Di O
La O
for O
a O
while O
, O
but O
the O
menu B-AS
just O
never O
grabbed O
me O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
so O
good O
that O
there O
tends O
to O
be O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
a O
wait B-AS
. O

The O
Food B-AS
Though O
much O
of O
the O
menu B-AS
draws O
from O
border O
countries O
with O
the O
likes O
of O
pasta B-AS
, O
cordon O
bleu O
and O
schnitzel O
, O
dishes B-AS
that O
involve O
cheese B-AS
are O
best O
. O

Don O
' O
t O
ask O
for O
menu O
, O
steak B-AS
is O
what O
you O
will O
have O
, O
along O
with O
great O
creamed O
spinach B-AS
. O

The O
staff B-AS
treated O
me O
as O
if O
I O
were O
a O
celebrity O
, O
which O
I O
am O
not O
and O
they O
did O
not O
make O
me O
feel O
uncomfortable O
as O
a O
single O
diner B-AS
. O

Salads B-AS
vary O
, O
but O
dinner B-AS
specials I-AS
( O
standard O
diner B-AS
fare I-AS
) O
are O
usually O
more O
than O
adequate O
. O

I O
had O
read O
good O
reviews O
about O
the O
value B-AS
and O
food B-AS
quality I-AS
at O
this O
restaurant O
, O
so O
I O
was O
not O
surprised O
to O
see O
a O
decently O
priced B-AS
menu I-AS
( O
pasta O
under O
$ O
10 O
and O
entrees B-AS
approx O
$ O
12 O
to O
$ O
15 O
) O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
was O
a O
little O
less O
than O
inviting O
as O
the O
tables B-AS
are O
close O
together O
and O
I O
could O
hear O
the O
brother O
/ O
sister O
couple O
next O
to O
us O
arguing O
( O
although O
this O
did O
provide O
entertainment B-AS
for O
the O
evening O
) O
. O

The O
sauce B-AS
was O
fresh O
, O
sweet O
, O
and O
had O
a O
bit O
of O
a O
garlic B-AS
kick I-AS
. O

Then O
, O
when O
we O
ordered O
from O
a O
regular O
menu B-AS
, O
and O
told O
the O
waiter B-AS
, O
that O
we O
are O
in O
a O
hurry O
to O
make O
the O
show O
, O
his O
response O
was O
So O
what O
do O
you O
want O
me O
to O
do O
? O

We O
saw O
the O
waitress B-AS
twice O
- O
once O
to O
tell O
us O
the O
night O
' O
s O
specials B-AS
and O
once O
to O
take O
our O
order O
. O

The O
Scene B-AS
Opened O
in O
1993 O
, O
Nick O
' O
s O
may O
be O
the O
only O
great O
pizza B-AS
place O
in O
the O
city O
of O
New O
York O
that O
isn O
' O
t O
older O
than O
most O
of O
the O
people O
who O
eat O
there O
. O

Weekday B-AS
lunch I-AS
is O
less O
crowded O
and O
the O
staff B-AS
cheerfully O
tolerated O
a O
3 O
- O
year O
- O
old O
. O

Being O
a O
basil B-AS
fanitac O
, O
the O
fresh O
leaves O
that O
come O
on O
the O
pizza B-AS
pie O
I O
ordered O
were O
a O
delight O
. O

Then O
I O
ordered O
a O
margarita O
, O
rocks O
w O
/ O
salt O
, O
the O
waitress B-AS
' O
replied O
: O
I O
don O
' O
t O
think O
we O
have O
salt O
What O
do O
you O
cook O
your O
food B-AS
with O
? O

But O
when O
the O
bartender B-AS
messes O
up O
the O
returned O
drinks B-AS
something O
is O
wrong O
. O

We O
were O
left O
waiting O
a O
while O
after O
our O
food B-AS
for O
our O
waiter B-AS
to O
return O
, O
and O
thus O
we O
did O
not O
have O
time O
for O
dessert B-AS
. O

The O
waitress B-AS
had O
the O
gall O
to O
ask O
us O
to O
close O
out O
our O
check O
when O
she O
brought O
our O
food B-AS
so O
she O
could O
go O
home O
rather O
than O
wait O
for O
us O
to O
finish O
( O
hey O
babe O
we O
waited O
for O
YOU O
, O
you O
can O
wait O
for O
US O
) O
. O

So O
we O
all O
did O
the O
buffet B-AS
- O
- O
one O
of O
my O
companions O
liked O
the O
lamb B-AS
very O
much O
. O

And O
when O
a O
waiter B-AS
, O
in O
answer O
to O
a O
question O
by O
a O
diner B-AS
, O
turns O
to O
another O
table O
and O
asks O
excuse O
me O
, O
do O
you O
know O
what O
this O
is O
? O

I O
am O
vegetarian O
- O
so O
this O
review O
applies O
only O
to O
the O
veg O
portion B-AS
of O
their O
menu B-AS
. O

She O
' O
s O
watching O
your O
table B-AS
, O
helping O
the O
staff B-AS
candy O
to O
your O
eyes O
. O

I O
came O
to O
celebrate O
finishing O
my O
third O
year O
of O
med O
school O
and O
was O
greatly O
disappointed O
by O
the O
way O
I O
was O
treated O
at O
the O
door O
( O
rude O
and O
terse O
) O
, O
the O
food B-AS
( O
mediocre O
) O
, O
and O
the O
ambiance B-AS
( O
very O
loud O
, O
crowded O
, O
and O
uncomfortable O
close O
to O
our O
neighbors O
despite O
the O
large O
room B-AS
) O
. O

Each O
dish B-AS
is O
carefully O
prepared O
and O
is O
a O
tribute O
to O
the O
ingredients B-AS
being O
served B-AS
. O

This O
place O
overall O
is O
a O
bad O
dining B-AS
experience O
, O
its O
a O
tourist O
trap O
, O
save O
your O
money O
and O
go O
somewhere O
that O
you O
can O
actually O
taste O
the O
food B-AS
. O

it O
' O
s O
a O
joy O
to O
watch O
the O
chef B-AS
work O
, O
who O
refused O
to O
take O
my O
order O
but O
seeing O
him O
open O
my O
live B-AS
scallop I-AS
made O
me O
understand O
why O
. O

We O
ended O
up O
having O
appetizers O
in O
the O
lounge B-AS
, O
while O
listening O
to O
a O
really O
great O
DJ B-AS
. O

The O
server B-AS
also O
forgot O
about O
our O
dessert B-AS
. O

When O
asked O
to O
explain O
the O
hostess B-AS
told O
us O
she O
would O
lose O
money O
by O
seating B-AS
us O
instead O
of O
them O
. O

I O
waited O
15 O
minutes O
for O
the O
waiter B-AS
to O
take O
the O
bill O
from O
me O
and O
finally O
I O
got O
fed O
up O
with O
him O
walking O
past O
our O
table O
I O
had O
to O
start O
waving O
the O
bill O
in O
the O
air B-AS
and O
finally O
some O
other O
waitress O
took O
our O
bill O
. O

Cheap O
pitchers O
of O
beer B-AS
, O
cheap O
food B-AS
that O
just O
stopped O
kicking O
minutes O
before O
going O
on O
your O
plate O
, O
lots O
of O
burgers B-AS
, O
ribs B-AS
, O
sandwiches B-AS
. O

the O
food B-AS
sounded O
good O
enough O
on O
paper O
, O
with O
lots O
of O
clever O
names O
and O
interesting O
choices B-AS
, O
but O
once O
we O
bit O
in O
, O
the O
dishes O
were O
all O
pretty O
bland O
. O

I O
could O
not O
believe O
how O
much O
food B-AS
they O
brought O
out O
to O
the O
table B-AS
! O

Even O
though O
the O
place B-AS
was O
more O
than O
half O
empty O
he O
refused O
to O
do O
so O
because O
we O
had O
already O
given O
our O
order O
to O
the O
waiter B-AS
and O
a O
change B-AS
of O
tables B-AS
would O
cause O
too O
much O
confusion O
. O

The O
Scene B-AS
Flanked O
by O
a O
diner O
- O
style O
bar B-AS
on O
one O
side O
and O
glass O
cases O
of O
sweets O
on O
the O
other O
, O
General O
Store O
resembles O
a O
cozy O
mom O
- O
and O
- O
pop O
rest O
stop O
on O
the O
way O
through O
Pennsylvania O
Dutch O
country O
- O
- O
minus O
the O
cheesy O
gift O
shop O
. O

The O
bartender B-AS
ignored O
us O
for O
10 O
minutes O
before O
asking O
what O
we O
' O
d O
like O
to O
drink B-AS
although O
we O
were O
the O
only O
people O
waiting B-AS
for O
a O
table O
when O
we O
walked O
in O
. O

The O
lunch B-AS
specials I-AS
are O
reasonably O
priced B-AS
, O
but O
I O
avoid O
this O
place O
when O
I O
can O
only O
order O
off O
the O
regular O
menu B-AS
. O

There O
were O
about O
4 O
tables O
filled O
in O
the O
entire O
restaurant O
yet O
the O
hostess B-AS
made O
us O
sit O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
for O
20 O
mins O
- O
- O
she O
never O
would O
have O
come O
for O
us O
had O
we O
not O
approached O
her O
asked O
to O
be O
seated O
. O

( O
having O
asked O
for O
bread B-AS
at O
this O
point O
3 O
times O
and O
still O
with O
out O
) O
He O
dashed O
off O
before O
we O
even O
finished O
the O
drink B-AS
order O
! O

the O
kimchi O
and O
other O
sides O
were O
off O
, O
the O
rice B-AS
had O
red O
bean O
mixed O
in O
, O
and O
the O
waitress B-AS
gave O
us O
a O
double O
order O
of O
the O
bulgogi O
instead O
of O
two O
single O
orders O
of O
different O
meats B-AS
. O

There O
is O
a O
nice O
bar B-AS
( O
weve O
had O
a O
drink O
there O
a O
couple O
of O
times O
as O
a O
break O
from O
SoHo O
shopping O
and O
the O
cheese B-AS
sticks I-AS
are O
an O
additional O
attraction O
) O
and O
the O
dining B-AS
area I-AS
is O
light O
and O
airy O
with O
an O
open O
kitchen B-AS
. O

I O
' O
ve O
been O
here O
several O
times O
for O
Sunday O
brunch B-AS
now O
- O
( O
note O
: O
it O
helps O
if O
you O
' O
re O
a O
late O
riser O
as O
I O
find O
the O
wait B-AS
is O
always O
reasonable O
if O
you O
show O
up O
after O
3pm O
) O
. O

I O
recently O
went O
to O
this O
restaurant O
with O
some O
co O
- O
workers O
for O
lunch B-AS
and O
had O
an O
amazing O
time B-AS
. O

They O
didn O
' O
t O
have O
any O
salad B-AS
and O
the O
waiter B-AS
didn O
' O
t O
tell O
us O
this O
very O
smoothly O
. O

We O
waited O
over O
30 O
minutes O
to O
get O
our O
drinks B-AS
( O
which O
were O
brought O
over O
my O
the O
manager B-AS
) O
and O
we O
could O
not O
find O
anyhting O
that O
looked O
interesting O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
. O

It O
was O
more O
than O
enough O
food O
and O
drink O
for O
everyone O
, O
and O
at O
$ O
20 O
per O
person O
, O
including O
tax O
and O
tip B-AS
, O
the O
prices B-AS
cannot O
be O
beat O
! O

It O
was O
very O
loud O
, O
I O
felt O
too O
crowded O
, O
the O
man B-AS
chair I-AS
' O
s O
next O
to O
me O
made O
it O
impossible O
for O
the O
waiters B-AS
to O
pass O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
perfect O
, O
whether O
sitting O
down O
for O
dinner B-AS
or O
just O
having O
a O
drink O
at O
the O
bar O
and O
engaging O
the O
friendly O
bartenders B-AS
in O
converasation O
. O

A O
narrow O
corridor B-AS
leads O
to O
a O
tiny O
space O
where O
there O
are O
three O
tiny O
white O
tiled O
counters B-AS
, O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
mess O
( O
stacks O
of O
bottles O
, O
cans O
) O
and O
a O
small O
counter O
holding O
12 O
- O
14 O
entrees B-AS
. O

I O
discovered O
recent O
new O
management B-AS
has O
made O
major O
improvements O
at O
this O
location O
ie O
the O
bar B-AS
, O
dining B-AS
areas I-AS
, O
party O
room O
and O
bathrooms O
and O
keeping O
the O
kitchen B-AS
open O
after O
11PM O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
decent O
at O
best O
, O
and O
the O
ambience B-AS
, O
well O
, O
it O
' O
s O
a O
matter O
of O
opinion O
, O
some O
may O
consider O
it O
to O
be O
a O
sweet O
thing O
, O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
just O
annoying O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
I O
' O
ve O
always O
found O
the O
waiters B-AS
helpful O
with O
the O
wine B-AS
selection I-AS
, O
and O
there O
is O
always O
a O
good O
selection O
of O
wines B-AS
by O
the B-AS
glass I-AS
. O

Two O
Tom B-AS
' I-AS
s I-AS
food I-AS
is O
excellent O
, O
it O
more O
than O
makes O
up O
for O
the O
lack O
of O
decor B-AS
. O

To O
avoid O
the O
crowds O
, O
go O
during O
lunch O
, O
when O
the O
menu O
is O
augmented O
with O
warm O
sandwiches B-AS
, O
entree O
- O
sized O
salads B-AS
and O
country O
omelettes B-AS
. O

I O
don O
' O
t O
care O
for O
the O
entrees B-AS
, O
but O
the O
chicken B-AS
dumpling I-AS
soup I-AS
is O
delicious O
! O

The O
Bliss O
Bowl O
- O
- O
a O
large O
portion B-AS
of I-AS
brown I-AS
rice I-AS
, O
beans B-AS
, O
kale B-AS
, O
carrots B-AS
, O
broccoli O
, O
cauliflower O
, O
tofu O
, O
seaweed B-AS
and O
tahini B-AS
- O
- O
is O
the O
specialty O
of O
the O
house O
. O

While O
the O
food B-AS
isn O
' O
t O
out O
of O
this O
world O
, O
it O
offers O
a O
decent O
meal B-AS
at O
a O
decent O
price O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
decent O
, O
but O
WAY O
TOO O
SMALL O
of O
portions B-AS
for O
what O
you O
pay O
for O
. O

I O
went O
to O
the O
Hudson B-AS
bar I-AS
with O
my O
boyfriend O
and O
the O
guy B-AS
at O
the O
front O
door O
was O
extremely O
rude O
. O

The O
MooShu B-AS
spring I-AS
rolls I-AS
were O
tasty O
, O
steamed B-AS
dumplings I-AS
alright I-AS
. O

Those O
appetizers B-AS
only O
appeared O
after O
we O
complained O
to O
the O
manager B-AS
. O

The O
place B-AS
is O
not O
fancy O
, O
but O
their O
food B-AS
is O
wonderful O
. O

we O
told O
the O
waitress B-AS
and O
she O
told O
us O
that O
we O
ordered O
the O
dead B-AS
fish I-AS
as O
opposed O
to O
the O
swimming O
fish O
. O

We O
waited O
for O
thirty O
minutes O
for O
our O
table B-AS
, O
and O
after O
inquiring O
once O
about O
the O
status O
, O
we O
were O
rudely O
confronted O
by O
the O
hostess B-AS
. O

Without O
another O
word O
when O
we O
arrived O
, O
they O
added O
a O
chocolate B-AS
decoration I-AS
saying O
Happy O
Anniversary O
to O
our O
desserts B-AS
. O

The O
kitchen O
also O
offers O
just O
a O
few O
sushi O
- O
free O
entree B-AS
options I-AS
, O
such O
as O
a O
masterful O
tempura O
dinner O
and O
chicken B-AS
or O
salmon B-AS
teriyaki I-AS
. O

I O
had O
3 O
bottles O
of O
champagne B-AS
waiting O
on O
the O
table O
, O
the O
waitress B-AS
was O
very O
helpful O
, O
all O
15 O
guests O
were O
very O
pleased O
and O
we O
couldn O
' O
t O
have O
asked O
for O
a O
better O
night O
dining B-AS
outside O
in O
the O
lovely O
garden B-AS
. O

Great O
place B-AS
for O
a O
first O
date O
or O
dinner B-AS
with O
a O
picky O
group O
. O

All O
- O
night O
restaurant O
with O
excellent O
burgers B-AS
and O
stella O
on O
tap B-AS
. O

The O
overpriced O
ice O
cream O
is O
delicious O
but O
the O
service B-AS
is O
atrocious O
- O
not O
only O
do O
I O
have O
to O
wait O
to O
be O
admitted O
into O
this O
ice O
cream B-AS
joint I-AS
, O
but O
the O
waiter O
is O
a O
snide O
, O
gruff O
man O
more O
suited O
to O
be O
a O
trucker O
than O
an O
ice O
cream B-AS
shop I-AS
server I-AS
. O

Not O
only O
did O
it O
take O
them O
45 O
minutes O
to O
serve O
a O
salad B-AS
, O
when O
we O
complained O
, O
the O
manager B-AS
was O
abusive O
, O
told O
us O
to O
get O
out O
and O
literally O
started O
clearing O
the O
table O
while O
we O
were O
still O
eating O
. O

When O
my O
group O
complained O
to O
our O
waiter B-AS
about O
a O
cake B-AS
cutting O
fee O
that O
involved O
no O
cutting O
, O
the O
manager B-AS
came O
over O
to O
the O
table B-AS
and O
basically O
told O
us O
that O
it O
was O
our O
fault O
for O
not O
knowing O
that O
their O
policy O
was O
just O
to O
serve O
the O
plates O
, O
not O
to O
cut O
. O

The O
place B-AS
is O
hip O
and O
the O
decorations O
funky O
, O
but O
the O
food B-AS
is O
lacking O
. O

Recently O
I O
purchased O
a O
dish B-AS
to O
go O
, O
and O
found O
that O
all O
of O
my O
meal O
contained O
just O
one O
large O
piece O
of O
ginger B-AS
root I-AS
. O

When O
questioning O
our O
server B-AS
about O
a O
certain O
dish B-AS
, O
she O
kindly O
brought O
over O
the O
Union O
Sq O
. O

Food B-AS
and O
Service O
of O
the O
same O
high O
quality O
elsewhere O
in O
NY O
would O
have O
been O
twice O
the O
cost B-AS
. O

On O
my O
first O
visit O
, O
I O
asked O
the O
waiter B-AS
to O
please O
wrap O
my O
leftovers O
and O
was O
refused O
adamantly O
( O
he O
told O
he O
wasn O
' O
t O
allowed O
to O
package O
the O
low O
- O
priced O
food B-AS
) O
. O

They O
overfill O
the O
reservation B-AS
sheet O
so O
that O
the O
check O
is O
dropped O
off O
nearly O
with O
your O
food B-AS
and O
they O
are O
rushing O
you O
out O
of O
your O
booth B-AS
before O
you O
are O
finished O
. O

Although O
we O
arrived O
at O
the O
restaurant O
10 O
min O
late O
, O
the O
hostess B-AS
did O
not O
have O
a O
table B-AS
for O
us O
. O

Our O
waiter B-AS
took O
his O
time O
taking O
our O
drink B-AS
orders O
( O
' O
97 O
Italian O
red O
was O
good O
) O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
OK O
but O
I O
have O
to O
ask O
WHY O
they O
serve O
noodles B-AS
with I-AS
steak I-AS
? O
? O
? O

The O
inattentive O
waiters B-AS
never O
refilled O
our O
water O
glasses O
, O
never O
offered O
more O
drinks B-AS
, O
our O
silverware O
was O
never O
replaced O
, O
and O
it O
took O
almost O
half O
an O
hour O
at O
times O
for O
them O
to O
clear O
our O
table O
after O
we O
finished O
a O
course O
. O

Aside O
from O
the O
Sea O
Urchin O
, O
the O
chef B-AS
recommended O
an O
assortment O
of O
fish O
including O
Fatty O
Yellow O
Tail O
, O
Boton B-AS
Shrimp I-AS
, O
Blue O
Fin O
Torro O
( O
Fatty O
Tuna O
) O
, O
Sea B-AS
Eel I-AS
, O
etc O
. O

Be O
sure O
to O
taste O
the O
incredible O
assortment B-AS
of I-AS
vegetable I-AS
and O
seafood B-AS
spring I-AS
and O
summer O
rolls B-AS
. O

Waiters B-AS
were O
pretty O
slow O
, O
didnt O
refill O
my O
glass B-AS
of I-AS
water I-AS
until O
I O
was O
about O
to O
leave O
, O
and O
I O
had O
to O
ask O
several O
times O
to O
get O
the O
check B-AS
and O
the O
slices B-AS
of I-AS
lemon I-AS
. O

I O
though O
the O
service B-AS
could O
have O
been O
better O
, O
the O
staff O
are O
not O
experience O
enough O
to O
know O
how O
to O
make O
the O
drinks B-AS
without O
reading O
the O
instructions O
. O

It O
took O
about O
ten O
minutes O
to O
get O
out O
drink O
ordering O
after O
sitting O
down O
and O
once O
we O
recieved O
the O
bottle B-AS
our O
waitress B-AS
never O
once O
refilled O
our O
glasses B-AS
! O

Our O
meal B-AS
was O
capped O
of O
with O
the O
waiter B-AS
rudely O
saying O
he O
needed O
the O
table B-AS
for O
other O
customers O
. O

When O
the O
ice O
cream O
cake O
I O
ordered O
didnt O
hold O
up O
in O
their O
regular O
freezers O
temperature B-AS
, O
Giovanny O
immediately O
had O
a O
server B-AS
run O
out O
and O
got O
an O
identical O
cake O
in O
15 O
minutes O
. O

not O
fancy O
I O
think O
they O
keep O
their O
christmas B-AS
decorations O
up O
all O
year O
long O
, O
but O
good O
mexican B-AS
food I-AS
! O
! O

The O
food O
was O
definitely O
good O
, O
but O
when O
all O
was O
said O
and O
done O
, O
I O
just O
couldn O
' O
t O
justify O
it O
for O
the O
price B-AS
( O
including O
2 O
drinks B-AS
, O
$ O
100 O
/ O
person O
) O
. O

I O
love O
the O
complimentary O
hot B-AS
salsa I-AS
and O
fresh O
chips B-AS
that O
they O
put O
on O
the O
table B-AS
! O

With O
the O
exception O
of O
one O
late O
day O
when O
I O
came O
in O
for O
caffe O
and O
the O
waitress B-AS
nearly O
rushed O
us O
out O
since O
dinner B-AS
was O
coming O
around O
. O

Needless O
to O
say O
, O
we O
weren O
' O
t O
suprised O
when O
our O
server B-AS
told O
us O
he O
never O
put O
our O
appetizer B-AS
order O
in O
. O

I O
recommend O
using O
your O
bread B-AS
and O
sopping O
up O
the O
sauce B-AS
. O

Noise B-AS
level O
is O
high O
, O
and O
if O
you O
are O
a O
non O
smoker O
ask O
to O
be O
seated O
away O
from O
the O
bar B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
nice O
, O
but O
then O
its O
pretty O
hard O
to O
screw O
up O
Myers O
sausages O
, O
mashed O
potatoes O
and O
tinned B-AS
beans I-AS
isn O
' O
t O
it O
? O

The O
point B-AS
of O
dining B-AS
here O
is O
to O
get O
several O
Tasting O
plates B-AS
( O
two O
of O
us O
shared O
5 O
@ O
$ O
12 O
/ O
each O
and O
were O
quite O
full O
) O
, O
and O
try O
as O
many O
of O
the O
dishes O
on O
the O
menu O
as O
possible O
. O

After O
making O
our O
party O
wait O
for O
about O
an O
hour O
past O
our O
reservation B-AS
time I-AS
( O
which O
we O
chalked O
up O
to O
it O
being O
a O
busy O
Friday O
night O
) O
, O
they O
gave O
us O
a O
wobbly O
makeshift O
table O
that O
was O
set O
up O
in O
the O
path O
of O
the O
staff B-AS
rushing O
out O
of O
the O
kitchen O
. O

the O
staff B-AS
knows O
the O
regulars O
by O
name O
and O
the O
sushi O
chef O
even O
yells O
goodbye O
from O
behind O
the O
bar B-AS
. O

Usually O
you O
lose O
food B-AS
quality I-AS
the O
trendier B-AS
you O
go O
, O
but O
not O
at O
this O
place O
. O

small O
price B-AS
to O
pay O
to O
have O
dinner B-AS
on O
a O
Saturday O
night O
in O
downtown O
Manhattan O
. O

Their O
main B-AS
chef I-AS
Louie O
, O
makes O
the O
oddest O
specials O
you O
will O
ever O
see O
and O
the O
portions B-AS
are O
quite O
large O
. O

The O
space B-AS
is O
cool O
, O
but O
the O
food B-AS
and O
service B-AS
were O
awful O
. O

the O
water B-AS
guy I-AS
was O
extremely O
attentive O
, O
thank O
god O
he O
was O
because O
we O
had O
to O
ask O
him O
for O
our O
waitress B-AS
many O
times O
: O
for O
ordering O
our O
food B-AS
, O
more O
drinks O
, O
dessert B-AS
and O
check O
. O

They O
charge O
$ O
24 O
for O
entrees B-AS
and O
ask O
additional O
price B-AS
of O
$ O
3 O
for O
rice O
or O
$ O
6 O
for O
vegetables B-AS
as O
side O
dish O
! O

We O
had O
hot O
buffalo B-AS
tenders O
for O
an O
appetizer B-AS
, O
and O
the O
waitress B-AS
didn O
' O
t O
bother O
to O
come O
back O
to O
check O
on O
how O
we O
were O
doing O
on O
drinks B-AS
. O

My O
one O
complaint O
: O
Even O
though O
we O
arrived O
at O
our O
reservation B-AS
time O
, O
the O
host B-AS
asked O
us O
to O
wait O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
- O
- O
then O
forgot O
to O
seat O
us O
( O
I O
had O
to O
ask O
) O
. O

After O
fifteen O
minutes O
, O
when O
nobody O
even O
took O
our O
drink B-AS
order O
, O
I O
looked O
around O
to O
try O
to O
get O
our O
waitresses B-AS
attention O
only O
to O
see O
she O
and O
about O
five O
others O
of O
the O
waitstaff B-AS
were O
having O
an O
endless O
gabfest O
by O
the O
register O
. O

They O
seem O
to O
put O
the O
sauce B-AS
over I-AS
the I-AS
mozzarella I-AS
which O
allows O
the O
sauce O
to O
be O
the O
primary O
taste B-AS
. O

The O
staff B-AS
was O
knowledgeable O
about O
the O
cuisine B-AS
and O
answered O
my O
dining O
questions O
with O
professionalism O
and O
style O
. O

Seconds O
after O
we O
permitted O
our O
half O
- O
eaten O
fattened O
goose O
livers O
to O
be O
whisked O
away O
, O
our O
waitress B-AS
materialized O
, O
bearing O
two O
cold O
drinks B-AS
and O
the O
chef O
' O
s O
profound O
apologies O
for O
the O
dish O
- O
a O
completely O
unneccessary O
but O
vastly O
appreciated O
gesture B-AS
. O

Waiter B-AS
brought O
white O
instead O
of O
red B-AS
wine I-AS
. O

The O
Scene B-AS
This O
storefront O
eatery O
is O
decked O
with O
colorful O
Mexican B-AS
art I-AS
and O
party O
kitsch O
, O
but O
it O
gets O
dim B-AS
and O
moody O
enough O
in O
the O
evenings O
to O
suit O
a O
date O
. O

out O
of O
the O
handrolls O
, O
the O
yuka B-AS
( O
salmon O
, O
salmon B-AS
roe I-AS
, I-AS
and I-AS
cucumber I-AS
) O
the O
crispy B-AS
salmon I-AS
skin I-AS
were O
especially O
good O
. O

The O
food B-AS
at O
Forest O
Hills O
was O
great O
, O
the O
service O
more O
than O
perfect O
, O
but O
but O
the O
ambience B-AS
was O
too O
hot O
they O
do O
not O
have O
AC O
and O
the O
employes B-AS
was O
sweating O
a O
lot O
, O
it O
was O
a O
nasty O
esxperience O
because O
I O
eat O
in O
front O
of O
the O
service O
that O
was O
sweating O
like O
animals O
. O

They O
were O
playing O
top O
40 O
music O
the O
day O
I O
went O
which O
just O
didn O
' O
t O
work O
with O
the O
whole O
theme O
, O
but O
they O
had O
the O
trippy O
sci B-AS
- I-AS
fi I-AS
music I-AS
playing O
in O
the O
bathroom B-AS
, O
so O
it O
was O
almost O
right O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
pretty O
good O
, O
and O
so O
is O
the O
service O
, O
though O
on O
my O
first O
visit O
I O
told O
the O
waitress B-AS
I O
wanted O
my O
tuna O
black O
- O
and O
- O
blue O
and O
she O
had O
no O
idea O
what O
that O
was O
. O

However O
, O
after O
speaking O
with O
the O
manager B-AS
on O
the O
phone O
for O
about O
15 O
minutes O
, O
the O
waitress B-AS
said O
they O
couldn O
' O
t O
give O
us O
any O
discount O
but O
would O
gladly O
give O
us O
a O
free O
pitcher O
of O
sangria B-AS
. O

The O
deserts B-AS
are O
horrid O
, O
but O
the O
drinks B-AS
are O
always O
good O
. O

Evening O
service B-AS
- O
- O
featuring O
waiters B-AS
all O
in O
black O
- O
- O
is O
a O
little O
slow O
; O
plan O
on O
a O
leisurely B-AS
dinner I-AS
unless O
you O
' O
re O
headed O
for O
the O
theater O
. O

Took O
the O
waiter B-AS
10 O
minutes O
to O
get O
to O
our O
table B-AS
, O
and O
another O
15 O
minutes O
until O
the O
coffee B-AS
I O
ordered O
arrived O
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
made O
no O
effort O
to O
remember O
who O
had O
orderd O
what O
( O
just O
threw O
it O
on O
the O
table O
and O
bailed O
) O
, O
or O
even O
who O
ordered O
( O
I O
had O
to O
flag O
him O
so O
my O
wife O
could O
order O
her O
main O
dish B-AS
15 O
min O
after O
he O
had O
taken O
orders O
from O
others O
) O
. O

Plus O
, O
the O
food B-AS
was O
way O
over O
priced O
( O
even O
for O
Manhattan O
) O
and O
while O
it O
was O
decent O
in O
taste B-AS
, O
nothing O
made O
up O
for O
the O
outlandish O
prices B-AS
. O

a O
friend O
was O
taking O
me O
to O
dinner B-AS
for O
my O
birthday O
and O
said O
he O
recalled O
this O
place O
around O
96th O
bway O
that O
had O
great O
chicken B-AS
. O

At O
one O
point O
my O
friend O
knocked O
over O
a O
glass B-AS
and O
broke O
it O
to O
pieces O
, O
and O
the O
waitstaff B-AS
was O
so O
forgiving O
of O
it O
. O

Delicious O
food B-AS
, O
just O
stay O
away O
from O
the O
specials B-AS
of O
the O
day O
! O

And O
I O
pretty O
much O
had O
to O
tell O
the O
waiter B-AS
that O
when O
dinner B-AS
is O
late O
, O
you O
usually O
comp O
your O
guests O
something O
. O

The O
spaghetti B-AS
with I-AS
ricotta I-AS
cheese I-AS
is O
hands O
down O
my O
favorite O
thing O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
and O
I O
am O
big O
fan O
of O
the O
house O
wine O
. O

I O
followed O
my O
handsome O
waiter B-AS
' O
s O
suggestions O
for O
everything O
from O
my O
cranapple O
martini B-AS
, O
BBQ O
duck O
tostada O
appetizer O
and O
rum O
- O
glazed O
pork O
tenerloin O
entree O
to O
the O
scandalously O
good O
brownie O
sundae O
. O

Chicken O
with O
Mixed B-AS
vegetables I-AS
is O
an O
explosion O
of O
flavor B-AS
, O
many O
great O
spicy O
dishes B-AS
too O
. O

It O
was O
also O
very O
reasonably O
priced B-AS
, O
we O
had O
4 O
bottles O
of O
wine O
, O
appetizers O
, O
dinner B-AS
, O
and O
coffee O
and O
our O
bill O
was O
just O
over O
50 O
per O
person O
. O

Went O
for O
dinner B-AS
last O
Friday O
night O
with O
2 O
friends O
, O
and O
the O
staff B-AS
was O
incredibly O
nice O
. O

The O
owner B-AS
and O
his O
sister O
make O
you O
feel O
like O
you O
' O
ve O
been O
invited O
over O
to O
their O
house O
for O
dinner B-AS
. O

Waiting B-AS
for O
a O
table B-AS
is O
par O
for O
the O
course O
. O

If O
you O
can O
' O
t O
tolerate O
slow O
service B-AS
at O
a O
pizza B-AS
place O
, O
then O
spend O
more O
money O
elsewhere O
. O

I O
finally O
cancelled O
our O
order O
, O
the O
waiter B-AS
came O
back O
in O
5 O
min O
with O
our O
plates B-AS
. O

i O
won O
' O
t O
be O
going O
back O
, O
and O
i O
' O
ll O
tell O
all O
my O
friends O
not O
to O

that O

must O
be O
keeping O
a O

away O

I O
' O
ve O
never O
been O
able O
to O
find O
a O
lunch B-AS

in O
the O
midtown O
with O
the O
same O
quality B-AS
and O
service B-AS
, O
until O
now O
. O

They O
serve O
mostly O
paninis B-AS
( O
fancy O
Italian B-AS
sandwiches I-AS
) O
. O

There O
was O
live O
music B-AS
at O
the O
bar B-AS
, O
which O
made O
our O
wait O
for O
a O
table O
wonderful O
( O
we O
didn O
' O
t O
have O
reservations O
) O
. O

i O
went O
on O
a O
thurs O
night O
and O
it O
was O
a O
bit O
loud O
due O
to O
the O
many O
businessmen O
eating O
their O
dinner B-AS
, O
but O
the O
food O
and O
service B-AS
more O
than O
outdid O
the O
lack O
of O
peaceful O
dining O
. O

The O
mussels B-AS
and O
fries B-AS
at O
this O
place B-AS
were O
amazing O
! O

Ate O
at O
the O
bar B-AS

started O
with O
an O
amazing O
bowl B-AS
of I-AS
french I-AS
onion I-AS
soup I-AS
with I-AS
3 I-AS
cheeses I-AS
( O

Charming O
atmosphere B-AS
that O
seats B-AS
probably O
no O
moroe O
than O
35 O

Once O
we O
eventaully O
got O
seated O
( O
all O
tables B-AS
are O
practically O
on O
top O
of O
each O
other O
) O
, O
we O
were O
hustled O
through O
our O
meal B-AS
by O
a O
waitstaff B-AS
that O
clearly O
knows O
how O
quickly O
they O
need O
to O
turn O
the O
table O
over O
. O

The O
plum B-AS
wine I-AS
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
meal B-AS
was O
a O
nice O
touch O
. O

Once O
seated O
the O
waiter B-AS
took O
our O
drink B-AS
orders I-AS
only O
to O
return O
10 O
minutes O
later O
with O
the O
wrong O
drinks B-AS
. O

The O
chips B-AS
and I-AS
salsa I-AS
were O
good O
, O
the O
service O
was O
good O
, O
but O
the O
sangria O
and O
margaritas O
were O
very O
weak O
, O
the O
food B-AS
terrible O
, O
and O
the O
portions O
small O
. O

I O
just O
got O
back O
from O

this O

Gari O
was O
there O
when O
we O
visited O

himself O
prepared O
the O

us O

The O

was O
very O

usually O
it O
is O
a O
good O
indication O
that O
the O

would O
be O
worth O
the O

Althought O

not O

The O

never O
came O
by O
to O
check O
on O
us O
after O
the O
bus O
boy O
brought O
us O
our O
food B-AS

The O
pizzas B-AS
are O
a O
MUST O
TRY O

hence O
the O
name B-AS

Our O
experience O

reflected O
a O
lazy O
attitude B-AS
by O
the O

and O

After O
hearing O
all O
of O

you O
would O
think O
they O
were O
twice O
as O
much O
as O
the O

The O

the O
quality B-AS

This O
set O
off O
our O
critical O
eye O
: O
ceramic O

having O
edges O
higher O
than O
the O

votives O
hid O
the O
fact O

people O
who O
ordered O
them O

they O
already O

in O
which O
then O
we O
had O
to O
remind O
the O
staff B-AS

) O
. O

i O
just O
wish O
they O
wld O
drop O
some O
staff B-AS

sometimes O
you O

the O

we O
didn O

even O
let O
us O
bring O
our O
own O
cake B-AS
for O
the O
event B-AS
, O
which O
many O
restaurants O
may O
not O
allow O
you O
too O

They O
food B-AS
was O
good O
as O
I O
only O
sampled O
so O
I O
can O
' O
t O
really O
comment O
. O

Sam O
and O
the O
staff B-AS
at O
Rialto O
were O
so O
accomodating O
and O
gave O
us O
a O
dinner B-AS
event O
we O
will O
always O
remember O
. O

The O
prices B-AS
were O
outrageous O
, O
but O
we O
assumed O
the O
quality B-AS
would O
be O
commensurate O
, O
so O
we O
ordered O
. O

This O
was O
after O
we O
told O
the O
clueless O
hostess B-AS
we O
only O
wanted O
to O
have O
drinks B-AS
, O
and O
she O
seated O
us O
at O
a O
table O
. O

Both O
of O
our O
entrees B-AS
were O
cold O
, O
and O
my O
Lobster O
and O
Scallop O
Ravioli O
left O
me O
wondering O
where O
the O
seafood B-AS
was O
. O

it O
' O
s O
one O
of O
the O
cheapest O
eats O
in O
the O
city O
and O
the O
food O
is O
not O
bad O
if O
you O
sit O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
only O
- O
they O
have O
a O
decent O
chicken O
and O
/ O
or O
beef B-AS
tender I-AS
tips I-AS
but O
they O
cook O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
garlic O
so O
beware O
. O

The O
menu O
had O
more O
selections O
, O
price O
points O
that O
fit O
all O
our O
budgets O
and O
a O
new B-AS
Sushi I-AS
menu I-AS
that O
went O
over O
huge O
with O
the O
table B-AS
. O

When O
I O
was O
there O
with O
a O
friend O
the O
waiter B-AS
who O
served B-AS
us O
was O
pretty O
friendly O
. O

Well O
, O
its O
bar B-AS
is O
beginning O
to O
attract O
the O
high O
- O
heeled O
Forever O
21 O
ladies O
and O
hair O
- O
gelled O
men O
- O
who O
- O
love O
- O
them O
crowd O
( O
alas O
) O
and O
yet O
I O
must O
admit O
- O
- O
the O
food B-AS
is O
damn O
good O
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
did O
not O
know O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
and O
was O
very O
unaccomidating O
about O
substutions O
. O

The O
food B-AS
here O
does O
a O
great O
service B-AS
to O
the O
name O
( O
Cantonese O
that O
is O
. O

We O
would O
have O
left O
and O
gone O
to O
another O
restaurant O
but O
the O
host B-AS
kept O
saying O
that O
a O
table O
was O
opening O
up O
in O
5 O
minutes O
, O
people O
had O
just O
paid O
, O
etc O
- O
except O
when O
I O
went O
to O
check O
the O
table O
, O
they O
were O
ordering O
dessert B-AS
. O

My O
date O
knew O
the O
waiters B-AS
from O
years O
of O
dining B-AS
here O
, O
so O
we O
were O
treated O
like O
royalty B-AS
. O

We O
didn O
' O
t O
see O
the O
solitary O
waitress B-AS
after O
seating B-AS
ourself O
for O
over O
10 O
minutes O
. O

I O
' O
d O
recommend O
going O
across O
the O
street O
to O
Recharge O
for O
some O
healthy O
burgers B-AS
and O
fries B-AS
before O
hitting O
the O
bar B-AS
. O

People O
waiting B-AS
for O
tables O
stand O
at O
a O
drink B-AS
rail O
next O
to O
large O
windows B-AS
which O
open O
out O
over O
a O
leafy O
garden O
in O
the O
summertime O
. O

The O
service B-AS
on O
our O
visit O
was O
absolutely O
awful O
- O
a O
waiter B-AS
and O
two O
helpers O
couldn O
' O
t O
get O
our O
orders O
right O
and O
ignored O
several O
pleas O
for O
basics O
such O
as O
water B-AS
and O
beverage O
refills O
and O
utensils O
to O
eat O
desserts O
with O
. O

When O
we O
arrived O
, O
our O
table B-AS
wasn O
' O
t O
ready O
and O
we O
waited O
30 O
minutes O
in O
the O
bar B-AS
. O

We O
had O
an O
hour O
for O
lunch B-AS
, O
and O
service B-AS
was O
impeccable O
each O
time O
. O

the O
place B-AS
was O
empty O
and O
the O
waiters B-AS
just O
hung O
out O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
. O

After O
dinner B-AS
and O
even O
a O
few O
times O
during O
the O
owner B-AS
came O
upto O
us O
and O
asked O
us O
how O
we O
felt O
about O
the O
place O
and O
the O
food O
which O
doesn O
' O
t O
happen O
often O

empty O
the O
server B-AS
got O
our O
drinks B-AS
wrong O
3 O
times O
! O

The O
waitress B-AS
told O
us O
the O
portions B-AS
were O
not O
big O
, O
so O
we O
each O
got O
an O
entree B-AS
and O
shared O
a O
side O
. O

Once O
just O
for O
late O
night O
drinks O
( O
they O
have O
a O
great O
drink B-AS
menu I-AS
) O
and O
then O
again O
for O
dinner B-AS
. O

The O
Fettucine B-AS
Alfredo I-AS
was O
appropriately O
cheesy O
and O
dense O
but O
the O
show O
stopper O
was O
the O
Linguine O
with O
white B-AS
clam I-AS
sauce I-AS
. O

finally O
, O
onto O
dessert B-AS
, O
wherebv O
the O
waiter B-AS
told O
us O
he O
would O
have O
to O
scrape O
the O
bottom O
to O
give O
us O
any O
ice O
cream B-AS
. O

After O
a O
short O
30 O
minutes O
of O
chatting O
and O
enjoying O
our O
drinks O
we O
were O
approached O
by O
the O
very O
pretentious O
Maitre B-AS
D O
' O
who O
RUDELY O
demanded O
we O
order O
as O
our O
table B-AS
was O
needed O
. O

My O
husband O
' O
s O
steak B-AS
was O
prepared O
incorrectly O
, O
and O
the O
rest O
of O
us O
were O
almost O
done O
eating O
by O
the O
time O
they O
got O
his O
meal B-AS
back O
out O
. O

The O
servers B-AS
are O
constantly O
in O
your O
face O
asking O
if O
you O
want O
another O
drink B-AS
( O
mine O
was O
half O
full O
) O
. O

The O
final O
blow O
came O
when O
the O
waitress B-AS
scorned O
our O
16 O
% O
tip O
for O
the O
meal B-AS
. O

Seemed O
like O
they O
got O
something O
wrong O
with O
every O
drink B-AS
order O
Bartenders B-AS
were O
def O
. O

I O
had O
the O
salmon O
dish O
and O
while O
it O
was O
fine O
, O
for O
the O
price B-AS
paid O
, O
I O
expected O
it O
to O
have O
some O
type O
of O
flavor B-AS
. O

The O
cheese O
muffins O
served O
before O
the O
meal B-AS
and O
the O
butter B-AS
cookies I-AS
given O
to O
us O
after O
dinner B-AS
, O
were O
the O
highlight O
of O
our O
dining O
experience O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
also O
been O
amazed O
at O
all O
the O
new O
additions O
in O
the O
past O
few O
years O
: O
A O
new B-AS
Jazz I-AS
Bar I-AS
, O
the O
most O
fantastic O
Dining B-AS
Garden I-AS
, O
the O
Best O
Thin B-AS
Crust I-AS
Pizzas I-AS
, O
and O
now O
a O
Lasagna B-AS
Menu I-AS
which O
is O
to O
die O
for O
( O
these O
are O
not O
your O
average O
lasagnas O
) O
! O

Those O
less O
interested O
in O
people O
- O
watching O
dine O
inside O
the O
whimsical O
, O
wood O
- O
trimmed O
room B-AS
under O
a O
canopy O
of O
Italian O
inscriptions O

or O
at O
the O
long O
, O

lined O
bar B-AS
, O
which O
hosts O
a O
hopping O
after O
- O
work O
crowd B-AS
. O

I O
' O
ve O
heard O
that O
if O
you O
sit O
at O
the O
sushi B-AS
bar I-AS
, O
you O
can O
request O
rolls O
, O
but O
if O
you O
' O
re O
at O
a O
table B-AS
, O
the O
rolls O
are O
just O
the O
fish B-AS
wrapped O
in O
seaweed O
with O
rice O
( O
which O
is O
still O
good O
, O
but O
I O
really O
love O
creative O
rolls O
) O
. O

I O
haven O
' O
t O
had O
much O
Argentinian B-AS
cuisine I-AS
, O
but O
the O
food B-AS
there O
is O
really O
good O
. O

Crowded O
waiting B-AS
area I-AS
in O
entrance O
forced O
you O
to O
sweat O
out O
the O
wait O
for O
a O
table B-AS
while O
standing O
over O
other O
diners O
. O

Both O
appetizers B-AS
arrived O
cold O
/ O
luke O
- O
warm O
, O
which O
we O
had O
to O
send O
back O
, O
only O
to O
have O
the O
waiter B-AS
tell O
us O
that O
one O
was O
supposed O
to O
be O
cold O
. O

I O
must O
admit O
the O
times O
my O
family O
( O
6 O
or O
more O
) O
have O
had O
dinner B-AS
there O
the O
service B-AS
seemed O
to O
forget O
us O
after O
serving B-AS
the O
main O
course O
. O

The O
appetizers B-AS
are O
ok O
, O
but O
the O
service B-AS
is O
slow O
. O

The O
ambience B-AS
was O
nice O
, O
but O
service B-AS
wasn O
' O
t O
so O
great O
. O

Having O
just O
returned O
from O
Bourbon O
Street O
, O
I O
thought O
I O
had O
experienced O
the O
steepest B-AS
drink I-AS
prices I-AS
in O
the O
US O
, O
but O
this O
is O
worse O
than O
N O
' O
awlins O
, O
where O
at O
least O
the O
expensive O
drinks O
cover O
wonderful O
live O
music B-AS
. O

Don O
' O
t O
go O
if O
you O
want O
a O
serene O
environment B-AS
to O
go O
with O
your O
sushi B-AS
. O

I O
had O
the O
Steamed B-AS
Mussels I-AS
and I-AS
Clams I-AS
and I-AS
the O
sauce B-AS
was O
to O
die O
for O
. O

If O
you O
' O
re O
looking O
a O
spicy O
vindaloo B-AS
or O
a O
tikka B-AS
masala I-AS
head O
to O
a O
curry B-AS
house O
instead O
. O

servings B-AS
are O
plentiful O
and O
evey O
dish B-AS
is O
delicious O
( O
except O
for O
the O
lemon B-AS
potatoes I-AS
) O
. O

Plenty O
of O
tables B-AS
avail O
for O
no O
reservation O
in O
bar O
areain O
case O
you O
want O
to O
go O
on O
an O
expensive O
date O
for O
not O
so O
great O
food B-AS
. O

They O
also O
have O
Korean B-AS
BBQ I-AS
and O
very O
beer O
- O
friendly O
Korean B-AS
appetizer I-AS
( O
like O
KimChee O
) O
. O

The O
Scene B-AS
Every O
time O
another O
loud O
, O
bouncy O
Mexican O
tune O
kicks O
in O
on O
the O
corner O
jukebox B-AS
, O
you O
' O
d O
swear O
this O
small O
diner B-AS
is O
on O
the O
brink O
of O
a O
full O
- O
on O
fiesta O
. O

When O
we O
got O
there O
, O
they O
refused O
to O
seat B-AS
us O
because O
our O
4th O
wasn O
' O
t O
there O
yet O
- O
even O
thought O
there O
were O
only O
two O
other O
people O
there O
and O
we O
assured O
them O
we O
would O
order O
some O
starters O
and O
drinks B-AS
. O

drink B-AS
, O
share O
your O
delicious O
entree B-AS
' O
s O
and O
then O
head O
to O
the O
bar O
to O
mingle O
. O

There O
are O
few O
tables B-AS
; O
most O
likely O
, O
you O
' O
ll O
be O
seated O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
or O
on O
a O
stool O
facing O
the O
wall O
. O

During O
the O
day O
, O
the O
sushi B-AS
bar I-AS
can O
be O
backed O
up O
a O
bit O
( O
thanks O
to O
their O
unbeatable O
lunch B-AS
specials I-AS
) O
so O
order O
early O
. O

If O
you O
mind O
waiting B-AS
for O
your O
pie O
to O
be O
made O
( O
the O
wait O
canbe O
over O
an O
hour O
, O
especially O
for O
a O
square B-AS
pie O
) O
, O
I O
recommend O
calling O
ahead O
and O
placing O
your O
order O
for O
pick O
- O
up O
. O

Perhaps O
I O
chose O
the O
wrong O
place B-AS
, O
not O
fully O
appreciating O
that O
another O
reviewer O
' O
s O
remark O
that O
diners B-AS
here O
won O
' O
t O
be O
rushed O
could O
translate O
to O
my O
timely O
- O
arrived O
party O
having O
to O
wait O
' O
til O
9 O
: O
50PM O
to O
be O
seated O
for O
a O
9PM O
Saturday O
reservation O
. O

this O
has O
become O
one O
of O
my O
favorite O
spots O
to O
hang O
out O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
and O
drink B-AS
martinis I-AS
, O
not O
only O
because O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
energetic O
and O
lively O
, O
but O
also O
becasue O
the O
staff B-AS
are O
so O
friendly O
. O

Just O
don O
' O
t O
take O
the O
seat B-AS
between O
the O
bar B-AS
and O
the O
back O
half O
of O
the O
restaurant O
, O
i O
saw O
a O
woman O
get O
nudged O
40times O
sitting O
there O
. O

It O
was O
more O
than O
enough O
food B-AS
even O
though O
the O
portions B-AS
are O
tiny O
. O

Today O
I O
placed O
a O
lunch B-AS
order O
and O
the O
guy B-AS
hung O
up O
on O
me O
while O
I O
was O
saying O
thank O
you O
! O

The O
menu B-AS
was O
nothing O
special O
( O
I O
had O
to O
switch O
my O
entree O
choices O
several O
times O
because O
the O
server B-AS
told O
me O
that O
the O
portion O
is O
really O
REALLY O
small O
! O
) O

you O
need O
to O
steer O
clear O
of O
- O
- O
our O
fish B-AS
was O
burned O
on O
the O
outside O
, O
raw O
on O
the O
inside O
and O
we O
won O
' O
t O
even O
discuss O
the O
fried B-AS
oysters I-AS
and I-AS
clams I-AS
( O
we O
had O
ONE O
clam O
! O
) O

We O
had O
a O
9 O
: O
30pm O
reservation B-AS
for O
two O
which O
stretched O
out O
to O
an O
hour O
wait B-AS
. O

The O
liquid O
brunch B-AS
consisting O
of O
3 O
drinks B-AS
( O
bloody O
marys O
, O
mimosas B-AS
or O
screwdrivers O
) O
and O
coffee O
and O
an O
entree B-AS
is O
quite O
a O
bargain O
. O

The O
menu B-AS
could O
be O
a O
little O
bigger O
but O
my O
food B-AS
as O
well O
as O
my O
boyfriend O
' O
s O
was O
outstanding O
( O
and O
a O
lot O
less O
expensive O
than O
I O
expected O
) O
. O

The O
smell O
near O
the O
bar B-AS
is O
unbearable O
, O
the O
food B-AS
is O
so O
so O
, O
nothing O
out O
of O
the O
norm O
, O
just O
very O
plan O
. O

After O
I O
inquired O
why O
the O
food B-AS
was O
taking O
so O
long O
, O
the O
waitress B-AS
told O
us O
that O
the O
2 O
dishes O
we O
ordered O
take O
a O
long O
time B-AS
. O

For O
the O
most O
part O
I O
enjoyed O
my O
dining B-AS
experience I-AS
at O
Revival O
( O
not O
to O
be O
confused O
with O
the O
bar B-AS
on O
15th O
) O
. O

But O
the O
service B-AS
, O
though O
invariably O
genial O
and O
helpful O
, O
can O
be O
weirdly O
haphazard O
- O
- O
waiters B-AS
disappear O
mysteriously O
, O
only O
to O
reemerge O
just O
when O
you O
' O
ve O
decided O
their O
shift O
must O
have O
ended O
- O
- O
possibly O
an O
understaffing O
issue O
? O

The O
salads B-AS
were O
amazing O
in O
themselves O
- O
mixed B-AS
greens I-AS
andtomato O
wedges O
in O
a O
delicious O
balsamic B-AS
vinagrette I-AS
with O
slices B-AS
of O
Italian B-AS
bread I-AS
with O
warm O
goat B-AS
cheese I-AS
. O

The O
rude O
and O
unaccomodating O
hostess B-AS
( O
who O
we O
later O
learned O
was O
the O
manager B-AS
) O
repeatedly O
promised O
us O
the O
next O
table O
but O
never O
offered O
to O
buy O
us O
a O
drink B-AS
while O
we O
waited O
. O

Though O
if O
the O
restaurant O
got O
bigger O
, O
the O
service B-AS
and O
quality B-AS
of O
the O
food B-AS
would O
probably O
suffer O
. O

I O
specifically O
recommend O
the O
eggs B-AS
with I-AS
potato I-AS
pancakes I-AS
for O
breakfast B-AS
and O
the O
orange O
beef O
for O
dinner O
. O

Fun O
atmosphere B-AS
, O
good O
beer O
selection O
, O
but O
meals O
were O
skimpy O
portions B-AS
on O
big O
plates O
and O
the O
service B-AS
was O
weak O
- O
never O
had O
the O
same O
server O
/ O
waitperson O
come O
back O
twice O
. O

I O
walk O
in O
ask O
to O
take O
a O
look O
a O
the O
menu B-AS
and O
was O
greeted O
by O
the O
a O
nasty O
not O
so O
passive O
aggressive O
hostess B-AS
. O

Although O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
a O
few O
minutes O
for O
our O
table B-AS
, O
the O
manager B-AS
bought O
us O
a O
round B-AS
of I-AS
drinks I-AS
and O
proceeded O
to O
take O
care O
of O
throughout O
the O
entire O
meal B-AS
. O

straining O
to O
read O
the O
menu B-AS
under O
the O
low O
- O
lighting O
- O
tag O
- O
sale O
- O
chandelier O
motif O
, O
we O
were O
able O
to O
order O
a O
salad B-AS
, O
tapas O
, O
and O
entrees B-AS
from O
the O
first O
of O
several O
waiters B-AS
, O
none O
of O
whom O
were O
able O
to O
introduce O
themselves O
, O
recommend O
dishes B-AS
, O
present O
silverware O
, O
remove O
plates B-AS
, O
or O
deliver O
water O
when O
asked O
. O

As O
we O
were O
wrapping O
up O
a O
very O
rushed O
meal B-AS
- O
- O
appetizers B-AS
were O
barely O
started O
when O
the O
entrees B-AS
arrived O
crowding O
a O
table B-AS
for O
two O
at O
which O
three O
were O
crammed O
- O
- O
the O
hostess B-AS
charged O
over O
and O
grabbed O
a O
half B-AS
- I-AS
full I-AS
wine I-AS
glass I-AS
declaring I-AS
thanks O
ladies O
, O
I O
' O
ll O

That O
bastion O
of O
authentic O
Mexican B-AS
food I-AS
in O
Spanish O
Harlem O
that O
earned O
raves O
by O
white O
reviewers B-AS
, O
leading O
other O
gringos O
to O
nervously O
venture O
to O
Spanish O
Harlem O
and O
pretend O
they O
' O
re O
trendy O
to O
pay O
too O
much O
for O
food O
that O
is O
only O
marginally O
better O
than O
the O
place O
around O
the O
corner O
. O

Waited O
30 O
min O
for O
a O
brick O
they O
call O
bread B-AS
and O
water B-AS
, O
another O
hour O
for O
food B-AS
( O
tiiiiiiiny O
portions B-AS
) O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
still O
to O
die O
for O
, O
but O
the O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
has O
so O
clearly O
been O
pared O
down O
and O
marked O
up O
( O
as O
a O
result O
of O
higher O
foot O
traffic O
brought O
in O
by O
lots O
of O
rave O
reviews O
in O
local O
publications O
, O
perhaps O
? O

They O
have O
little O
booths O
if O
you O
want O
a O
little O
privacy B-AS
w O
/ O
your O
date O
~ O
and O
they O
have O
large O
tables B-AS
for O
families O
and O
groups O
. O

One O
hour O
into O
our O
dinner B-AS
, O
we O
were O
told O
by O
the O
hostess B-AS
that O
we O
needed O
to O
hurry O
up O
and O
finish O
so O
that O
they O
could O
accommodate O
the O
next O
party O
' O
s O
reservation B-AS
. O

So O
when O
i O
walked O
in O
i O
was O
just O
blown O
away O
by O
the O
lighting B-AS
, O
flowers O
, O
wood O
and O
iron O
work O
, O
a O
reservationist O
, O
and O
a O
full O
bar B-AS
. O

The O
portions B-AS
were O
very O
big O
for O
appetizers B-AS
( O
calimari B-AS
and I-AS
fried I-AS
zucchini I-AS
) O
but O
average O
for O
the O
entrees O
( O
chicken B-AS
marsala I-AS
, O
spaghetti B-AS
w I-AS
/ I-AS
meatballs I-AS
) O
and O
very O
expensive O
of O
course O
. O

The O
Service O
was O
en O
pointe O
and O
I O
felt O
like O
the O
servers B-AS
were O
always O
aware O
of O
our O
wants O
, O
whether O
it O
was O
punctual O
refill O
of O
water B-AS
, O
new O
napkins O
, O
etc O
. O

While O
the O
server B-AS
offered O
nothing O
, O
the O
host B-AS
apologized O
, O
and O
said O
that O
he O
hoped O
that O
I O
would O
return O
again O
, O
perhaps O
for O
brunch B-AS
. O

The O
food O
came O
out O
wrong O
, O
the O
waiter B-AS
was O
no O
where O
to O
be O
found O
and O
the O
wine O
showed O
up O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
meal B-AS
. O

Jackson O
Diner B-AS
was O
my O
first O
intro O
to O
true O
Indian B-AS
food I-AS
and O
its O
been O
10yrs O
since O
and O
I O
cannot O
go O
one O
month O
without O
some O
of O
this O
unbelievable O
food O
. O

Apparently O
, O
the O
waitress B-AS
informed O
us O
that O
they O
change O
the O
menu B-AS
at O
5 O
Ninth O
every O

kind O
of O
explains O
the O
hit O
or O
miss O
situation O
. O

They O
were O
more O
than O
happy O
to O
seat B-AS
us O
even O
though O
we O
were O
early O
for O
our O
reservation B-AS
. O

The O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
was O
attentive O
without O
being O
overbearing O
, O
and O
our O
waiter O
gave O
thoughtful O
advice O
on O
dishes B-AS
that O
would O
be O
suitable O
for O
the O
children O
. O

I O
would O
only O
recommend O
this O
restaurant O
to O
a O
friend O
if O
waiting O
at O
least O
40 O
minutes O
for O
your O
RESERVATION B-AS
is O
acceptable O
, O
and O
you O
don O
' O
t O
mind O
paying O
for O
relatively O
standard O
fare B-AS
. O

He O
did O
do O
the O
service B-AS
part O
well O
enough O
- O
- O
brought O
the O
food B-AS
, O
etc O
. O

Needing O
a O
sugar B-AS
fix O
, O
my O
husband O
and O
I O
walked O
in O
here O
to O
find O
a O
wall O
to O
wall O
adornment O
of O
delightful O
confections B-AS
. O

me O
, O
i O
hated O
it O
, O
the O
center O
of O
the O
pork B-AS
one O
was O
frozen O
, O
salad B-AS
was O
ok O
, O
wine B-AS
was O
a O
little O
corcked O
. O

The O
bar B-AS
was O
a O
disaster O
because O
there O
were O
no O
tables B-AS
for O
anyone O
, O
and O
drinks B-AS
took O
20 O
minutes O
to O
receive O
. O

since O
it O
looks O
like O
everyone O
' O
s O
already O
familiar O
with O
the O
rude O
hostess B-AS
and O
long O
wait B-AS
for O
a O
table O
( O
even O
with O
a O
reservation B-AS
) O
, O
i O
' O
ll O
skip O
that O
part O
. O

I O
usually O
run O
the O
other O
way O
when O
I O
hear O
of O
an O
Italian O
restaurant O
with O
huge O
portions B-AS
, O
because O
it O
' O
s O
usually O
a O
lot O
of O
mediocre O
food B-AS
. O

I O
' O
ve O
only O
been O
here O
once O
for O
dinner B-AS
but O
I O
think O
the O
lunch B-AS
specials I-AS
are O
definitely O
a O
better O
deal O
. O

Although O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
a O
long O
while O
and O
the O
hostess B-AS
was O
very O
busy O
behind O
the O
bar B-AS
, O
she O
was O
very O
apologetic O
and O
sincere O
which O
made O
it O
feel O
ok O
to O
have O
to O
wait O
. O

It O
' O
s O
just O
a O
diner B-AS
, O
but O
three O
decent O
hearty B-AS
lunches I-AS
for O
12 O
bucks O
? O

Although O
we O
were O
seated O
35 O
minutes O
after O
our O
reservation B-AS
the O
service B-AS
from O
then O
on O
was O
outstanding O
. O

Since O
the O
service B-AS
was O
so O
poor O
, O
we O
asked O
if O
they O
could O
offer O
any O
concessions O
- O
complimentary O
drinks B-AS
? O

Our O
waitress B-AS
asked O
us O
if O
we O
wanted O
anything O
else O
, O
we O
said O
only O
the O
check O
- O
she O
quickly O
scooped O
up O
our O
not O
- O
yet O
finished O
food B-AS
. O

Waiter B-AS
dropped O
check B-AS
on O
table O
while O
I O
was O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
handing O
my O
wife O
her O
anniversary O
present O
. O

I O
' O
d O
like O
to O
try O
their O
brunch B-AS
- O
the O
menu B-AS
looks O
good O
. O

The O
sangria B-AS
was O
served B-AS
quickly O
and O
often O
. O

Bountiful O
sushi B-AS
platters I-AS
, O
which O
focus O
on O
familiar O
basics O
like O
salmon B-AS
and I-AS
tuna I-AS
, O
are O
best O
followed O
by O
green O
- O
tea O
ice O
cream B-AS
for O
dessert B-AS
. O

Each O
dish B-AS
had O
its O
own O
distinct O
character O
and O
pleasant O
flavor B-AS
surprises I-AS
. O

Nonetheless O
, O
we O
are O
looking O
forward O
to O
the O
next O
time O
for O
more O
pizza B-AS
and O
the O
great O
service B-AS
. O

When O
his O
to O
sons O
joined O
the O
mix B-AS
they O
took O
Dads O
quest O
for O
the O
best O
food B-AS
another O
step O
adding O
slowly O
to O
the O
menu B-AS
a O
host O
of O
items O
that O
reflect O
the O
demigraphic O
of O
this O
still O
growing O
nabe O
. O

Once O
we O
had O
our O
menus B-AS
we O
were O
nearly O
assaulted O
by O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
asking O
if O
we O
were O
ready O
to O
order O
. O

On O
each O
of O
my O
several O
visits O
, O
the O
crowd B-AS
is O
local O
, O
professional O
, O
family O
and O
those O
who O
are O
not O
familiar O
with O
the O
cuisines B-AS
of O
India O
are O
deftly O
walked O
through O
the O
menu B-AS
by O
management B-AS
. O

The O
place B-AS
was O
small O
and O
simple O
, O
but O
I O
never O
cared O
about O
service O
or O
decor B-AS
. O

There O
are O
a O
few O
things O
I O
can O
forgive O
at O
any O
popular O
place O
: O
somewhat O
long O
waits O
even O
with O
reservations B-AS
, O
service B-AS
staff I-AS
that O
mistakenly O
believes O
they O
' O
re O
there O
to O
act O
haughty O
rather O
than O
serve O
, O
and O
a O
way O
over O
- O
the O
- O
top O
interior B-AS
. O

We O
got O
there O
early O
so O
there O
wasn O
' O
t O
much O
of O
a O
wait B-AS
- O
- O
otherwise O
, O
I O
usually O
sit O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
and O
have O
a O
cocktail B-AS
. O

While O
the O
decor O
is O
a O
bit O
bland O
- O
- O
a O
white B-AS
room I-AS
with O
a O
few O
fake O
palm O
trees O
and O
thatched O
roof O
- O
- O
the O
service B-AS
is O
fast O
and O
friendly O
. O

The O
Raz B-AS
Mojito I-AS
is O
excellent O
( O
stay O
away O
from O
the O
champagne B-AS
) O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
horrible O
, O
we O
had O
the O
Peking B-AS
duck I-AS
salad I-AS
, O
tuna B-AS
, I-AS
vegetable I-AS
fried I-AS
rice I-AS
, O
and O
the O
spinach B-AS
. O

I O
' O
ll O
give O
it O
to O
Sea O
; O
the O
decor O
is O
pretty O
cool O
and O
the O
food B-AS
was O
good O
, O
but O
the O
service B-AS
was O
beyond O
terrible O
! O

I O
went O
here O
all O
4 O
years O
that O
I O
lived O
in O
the O
area B-AS
, O
and O
being O
a O
not O
- O
so O
- O
loaded O
student O
, O
it O
was O
a O
great O
place O
to O
go O
for O
some O
good O
sushi B-AS
and O
a O
very O
pleasant O
comforting O
atmosphere B-AS
. O

We O
started O
with O
the O
guacamole B-AS
and O
this O
is O
by O
far O
the O
best O
I O
' O
ve O
ever O
had O
bar B-AS
none O
. O

and O
to O
get O
an O
extra O
side O
vegtable B-AS
was O
close O
to O
$ O
20 O
for O
overdone O
asparagus B-AS
that O
had O
no O
taste O
. O

Eggs B-AS
benedict I-AS
with I-AS
smoked I-AS
salmon I-AS
was O
equally O
fine O
and O
the O
portion B-AS
was O
adequate O
for O
lunch B-AS
. O

the O
wait B-AS
for O
our O
drinks B-AS
, O
appetizers B-AS
and O
food B-AS
was O
very O
long O
, O
the O
food O
was O
mediocre O
, O
and O
it O
was O
a O
bit O
pricey O
. O

Hillarious O
lighting O
and O
ecclectic O
side O
dishes O
make O
you O
want O
to O
love O
the O
place B-AS
, O
but O
the O
meal B-AS
on O
the O
whole O
was O
abyssmal O
. O

The O
mariachi O
band O
that O
walked O
around O
during O
dinner B-AS
was O
fun O
and O
like O
I O
stated O
before O
the O
food B-AS
is O
delish O
! O

Went O
to O
Gallaghers O
for O
the O
first O
time O
on O
a O
Saturday O
night O
, O
had O
no O
problem O
getting O
reservations B-AS
, O
great O
staff O
- O
great O
service B-AS
. O

The O
chef B-AS
even O
came O
out O
with O
a O
sample O
some O
new B-AS
appetizers I-AS
he O
' O
s O
working O
on O
( O
the O
tuna B-AS
tartare I-AS
is O
a O
keeper O
! O

Even O
better O
was O
the O
food O
, O
had O
shrimp B-AS
wrapped I-AS
in I-AS
prosciutto I-AS
, O
followed O
by O
lamb B-AS
chops I-AS
, O
and O
of O
course B-AS
a O
double O
macchiato O
to O
finish O
it O
all O
off O
. O

I O
love O
the O
food B-AS
and O
as O
a O
person O
that O
does O
not O
drink B-AS
often O
or O
regularly O
, O
I O
am O
practically O
addicted O
to O
their O
sangria B-AS
. O

The O
amble B-AS
sweetbreads I-AS
and O
goat B-AS
cheese I-AS
/ I-AS
caviar I-AS
ravioli I-AS
appetizers I-AS
were O
memorable O
, O
but O
the O
highlight O
of O
our O
dinner B-AS
was O
the O
scallops B-AS
in I-AS
a I-AS
cream I-AS
reduction I-AS
entree I-AS
- O
truly O
heavenly O
. O

The O
whole O
time O
we O
were O
waiting O
the O
hostess B-AS
kept O
talking O
to O
us O
, O
telling O
us O
we O
wouldn O
' O
t O
lose O
our O
reservation B-AS
, O
and O
even O
gave O
us O
free O
blue B-AS
margarita I-AS
shots O
! O

Also O
the O
waiter B-AS
anever O
asked O
if O
the O
steaks B-AS
were O
cooked O
to O
out O
liking O
or O
if O
we O
wanted O
anything O
else O
. O

Don O
' O
t O
know O
if O
the O
bar B-AS
is O
really O
that O
bad O
, O
BUT O
the O
food B-AS
would O
more O
than O
compensate O
! O

The O
managers B-AS
aren O
' O
t O
snobby O
for O
wanting O
reservations B-AS
- O
- O
it O
' O
s O
a O
new O
restaurant O
and O
they O
' O
re O
trying O
to O
manage O
the O
flow O
of O
diners O
. O

I O
went O
there O
recently O
with O
my O
boyfriend O
and O
not O
only O
did O
it O
take O
the O
waitress B-AS
20 O
minutes O
to O
acknowledge O
we O
were O
even O
there O
, O
20 O
minutes O
to O
get O
us O
water B-AS
and O
coffee B-AS
and O
even O
MORE O
time O
to O
place O
our O
order O
and O
get O
food O
! O

A O
good O
restaurant O
would O
have O
at O
least O
comped O
desert O
or O
sent O
over O
a O
round B-AS
of I-AS
drinks I-AS
for O
such O
a O
long O
wait O
- O
- O
we O
didn O
' O
t O
even O
get O
an O
apology O
from O
a O
manager B-AS
. O

The O
sweetness O
of O
succulent B-AS
barbecued I-AS
pork I-AS
and O
thick B-AS
salsa I-AS
cruda I-AS
counterpoint O
a O
salty O
and O
garlicky O
fresh O
guacamole B-AS
. O

We O
complained O
to O
our O
waiter B-AS
serveral O
times O
about O
this O
and O
the O
stares O
continued O
and O
to O
top O
it O
all O
off O
as O
the O
manager O
walked O
around O
to O
each O
table B-AS
asking O
if O
they O
enjoyed O
their O
dinner B-AS
, O
he O
conveniently O
did O
not O
ask O
us O
! O

The O
Food B-AS
In O
a O
health O
- O
conscious O
century O
, O
it O
' O
s O
as O
likely O
to O
be O
the O
pub B-AS
grub O
as O
it O
is O
the O
booze O
that O
does O
you O
in O
. O

Although O
we O
were O
seated O
right O
away O
and O
the O
waiter B-AS
brought O
menus B-AS
promptly O
as O
well O
as O
drink B-AS
, O
he O
was O
almost O
never O
at O
our O
table O
despite O
being O
at O
the O
other O
tables O
right O
next O
to O
ours O
. O

Went O
there O
a O
few O
months O
ago O
, O
and O
while O
the O
food B-AS
was O
really O
good O
, O
and O
I O
was O
ready O
for O
it O
to O
be O
pricey O
, O
the O
one O
thing O
that O
bothered O
me O
was O
the O
waiter B-AS
was O
standing O
in O
a O
corner O
watching O
us O
eat O
. O

The O
average O
price B-AS
of O
a O
meal B-AS
( O
app B-AS
, O
entree B-AS
, O
1 O
drink B-AS
and O
tip B-AS
) O
is O
probably O
around O
$ O
28 O
. O

Although O
the O
food B-AS
what O
adequate O
, O
the O
service B-AS
was O
preposterous O
. O

We O
were O
also O
seated O
promptly O
at O
the O
time O
of O
our O
reservation B-AS
and O
the O
service B-AS
was O
very O
quick O
and O
professional O
. O

) O
I O
also O
noticed O
the O
table B-AS
next O
to O
ours O
didn O
' O
t O
enjoy O
her O
dish B-AS
and O
they O
went O
above O
and O
beyond O
to O
try O
to O
make O
up O
for O
it O
. O

Our O
waitress B-AS
was O
merely O
inattentive O
at O
first O
but O
became O
just O
plain O
hostile O
after O
we O
had O
the O
nerve O
to O
ask O
about O
the O
wine O
we O
had O
ordered O
to O
go O
with O
dinner B-AS
( O
we O
were O
halfway O
through O
our O
entrees B-AS
and O
still O
no O
wine O
) O
. O

We O
did O
enjoy O
the O
recommended O
, O
yet O
simple O
$ O
40 O
sangiovese O
, O
atmosphere B-AS
and O
loosey O
- O
goosey O
service B-AS
, O
but O
we O
were O
disappointed O
overall O
. O

I O
went O
to O
Mocca O
with O
my O
boyfriend O
for O
a O
few O
drinks B-AS
and O
food O
, O
and O
I O
was O
really O
impressed O
by O
the O
service B-AS
. O

oh O
, O
and O
if O
you O
' O
re O
there O
for O
drinks B-AS
at O
3 O
: O
30 O
on O
a O
weekday O
afternoon O
, O
when O
the O
place B-AS
is O
empty O
- O
and O
ask O
for O
a O
bread O
basket O
- O
they O
' O
ll O
charge O
you O
$ O
6 O
. O

I O
have O
been O
back O
for O
several O
dinners B-AS
and O
lunchs O
and O
especially O
like O
the O
terrace B-AS
when O
weather O
permits O
. O

The O
Food B-AS
Chef I-AS
Nao O
Sugiyama O
serves O
in O
the O
traditional O
kaiseki O
style O
- O
- O
a O
kind O
of O
tasting O
menu B-AS
consisting O
of O
between O
six O
and O
12 O
small O
courses O
. O

4 O
of O
had O
dinner B-AS
here O
last O
Saturday O
and O
we O
were O
all O
very O
disappointed O
with O
the O
food B-AS
and O
the O
service O
. O

Go O
in O
, O
take O
a O
deep O
breath O
and O
expect O
great O
food B-AS
, O
fairly O
priced O
with O
just O
about O
the O
worst O
service B-AS
in O
North O
Jersey O
! O

The O
crust B-AS
was O
a O
crispy O
tan O
dream O
come O
true O
with O
those O
little O
blackened B-AS
air I-AS
bubbles O
and O
chewy O
center O
. O

We O
told O
the O
waitress B-AS
a O
few O
more O
were O
coming O
and O
ordered O
drinks B-AS
. O

The O
menu B-AS
alternates O
between O
typical O
American B-AS
fare I-AS
( O
salads B-AS
, O
potato B-AS
skins I-AS
, O
Angus O
burgers B-AS
and I-AS
grilled I-AS
chicken I-AS
) O
and O
modestly O
international B-AS
cuisine I-AS
like O
fajitas O
, O
wraps B-AS
and O
pot B-AS
stickers I-AS
. O

It O
' O
s O
unfortunate O
because O
the O
food B-AS
is O
generally O
pretty O
good O
, O
although O
the O
waitstaff B-AS
did O
try O
to O
convince O
us O
once O
that O
the O
flan O
they O
gave O
us O
was O
really O
creme O
brulee O
. O

Our O
salads O
and O
appetizers B-AS
were O
brought O
at O
the O
same O
time O
and O
we O
barely O
had O
time O
to O
enjoy O
them O
before O
a O
team O
of O
waiters B-AS
whisked O
them O
( O
and O
our O
bread O
! O
) O

Her O
attitude O
put O
a O
damper O
on O
the O
evening O
, O
as O
did O
the O
stares O
from O
some O
servers B-AS
when O
we O
took O
a O
peek O
into O
the O
cheese B-AS
cellar I-AS
. O

When O
I O
went O
back O
to O
the O
hostess B-AS
( O
yes O
it O
was O
past O
the O
time O
we O
had O
for O
our O
original O
reservation B-AS
) O
- O
she O
said O
that O
it O
was O
fine O
to O
get O
seated O
but O
we O
needed O
to O
leave O
in O
an O
hour O
. O

Generous O
portions B-AS
of I-AS
rice I-AS
porridge I-AS
and O
noodles B-AS
really O
hit O
the O
spot O
after O
fighting O
the O
crowds B-AS
on O
a O
busy O
weekend O
in O
Chinatown O
. O

I O
loved O
the O
food B-AS
and O
service B-AS
here O
, O
the O
only O
downside O
was O
the O
decor B-AS
was O
dissappointing O
and O
the O
prices B-AS
are O
a O
bit O
high O
( O
about O
$ O
30 O
for O
an O
entree O
. O

one O
waiter B-AS
couldn O
' O
t O
remember O
what O
we O
had O
to O
drink B-AS
and O
we O
were O
the O
only O
people O
in O
the O
place O
. O

The O
wait B-AS
here O
is O
long O
for O
dim O
sum O
, O
but O
if O
you O
don O
' O
t O
like O
sharing O
tables O
or O
if O
the O
typical O
raucous O
dim B-AS
sum I-AS
atmosphere I-AS
is O
not O
your O
gig O
, O
this O
is O
a O
sleek O
( O
for O
Chinatown O
) O
alternative O
. O

I O
went O
with O
a O
party O
of O
7 O
, O
we O
all O
had O
drinks B-AS
, O
tomato B-AS
and I-AS
onion I-AS
salad I-AS
, O
slabs B-AS
of I-AS
bacon I-AS
, O
all O
the O
extras O
and O
magnificent O
steaks B-AS
. O

The O
waitstaff B-AS
can O
be O
hard O
to O
track O
down O
and O
uninformed O
about O
the O
menu B-AS
. O

Decent O
value B-AS
for O
decent O
chinese B-AS
food I-AS
for O
the O
area B-AS
- O
obviously O
you O
can O
get O
cheaper O
down O
in O
chinatown O
. O

The O
oysters B-AS
were O
warm O
as O
was O
the O
sushi O
that O
was O
served O
over O
dry O
rice B-AS
. O

Try O
the O
salmon B-AS
- O
I O
was O
a O
bit O
concerned O
about O
the O
fennel O
- O
but O
this O
dish B-AS
' O
s O
combination O
of O
textures O
and O
flavors B-AS
left O
me O
wanting O
more O
. O

I O
think O
I O
' O
m O
going O
to O
start O
taking O
the O
food B-AS
and O
coffee B-AS
to O
go O
b O
/ O
c O
everytime O
I O
go O
there O
( O
which O
is O
quite O
often O
) O
I O
get O
more O
frustrated O
with O
the O
service B-AS
. O

PDiddy O
need O
a O
new B-AS
staff I-AS
you O
would O
have O
thought O
it O
was O
a O
bunch O
of O
old O
people O
cooking O
the O
food B-AS
and O
waiting O
on O
us O
. O

We O
waited O
to O
be O
seated O
for O
about O
15 O
- O
20 O
minutes O
for O
brunch B-AS
, O
while O
it O
was O
quite O
obvious O
that O
there O
were O
plenty O
of O
empty O
tables B-AS
right O
in O
front O
of O
us O
. O

From O
the O
enormous O
menu B-AS
, O
we O
opted O
for O
the O
3 O
- O
course O
dinner O
specials O
- O
chicken O
soup O
or O
clam O
chowder O
, O
although O
small O
portions B-AS
, O
came O
with O
loads O
of O
rolls O
, O
crackers O
etc O
. O

I O
don O
' O
t O
drink O
coffee B-AS
so O
I O
can O
' O
t O
judge O
that O
but O
if O
you O
want O
a O
friendly O
place O
to O
take O
a O
time O
out O
- O
read O
- O
people O
watch O
and O
enjoy O
a O
bagle B-AS
, O
pastry B-AS
or O
sandwitch O
this O
is O
a O
great O
place O
with O
liberal O
politics O
and O
nop O
pretensions O
. O

Whatever O
the O
twist O
they O
supposedly O
have O
added O
is O
nothing O
new O
in O
Chinese B-AS
cuisine I-AS
( O
maybe O
except O
foie B-AS
gras I-AS
) O
. O

Dinner B-AS
was O
recently O
a O
lamb O
special O
- O
large O
gristly O
hunks O
of O
lamb O
slopped O
on O
plate O
, O
swimming O
in O
a O
pool O
of O
watery O
sauce B-AS
with I-AS
chopped I-AS
asparagus I-AS
thrown O
all O
over O
plate O
. O

A O
great O
place B-AS
to O
eat O
or O
just O
hang O
out O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
. O

I O
have O
dined O
at O
JG O
many O
times O
for O
dinner O
and O
lunch B-AS
over O
the O
past O
two O
years O
and O
both O
the O
food O
and O
the O
service B-AS
is O
by O
far O
the O
best O
compared O
to O
others O
in O
NYC O
or O
else O
where O
. O

Waitress B-AS
was O
nice O
but O
didnt O
know O
some O
specials B-AS
and O
was O
alittle O
off O
, O
think O
she O
was O
new O
. O

The O
top O
layer O
of O
my O
adobo B-AS
salad I-AS
was O
nice O
enough O
, O
but O
just O
below O
the O
surface O
it O
began O
to O
swim O
in O
a O
cloyingly O
sweet O
dressing O
, O
so O
that O
it O
became O
like O
some O
weird O
melted O
jello O
concoction B-AS
. O

Increedible O
value B-AS
, O
3 O
courses O
$ O
20 O
price O
fixe O
( O
menu B-AS
changes O
everyday O
) O
, O
organic O
seldom O
seen O
wines O
all O
around O
$ O
20 O
. O

Perfect O
place B-AS
to O
bring O
a O
date O
before O
the O
theater O
, O
a O
mother O
/ O
grandmother O
/ O
or O
aunt O
for O
their O
birthday O
, O
or O
friend O
for O
lunch B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
quality I-AS
is O
good O
, O
but O
the O
prices B-AS
are O
not O
worth O
it O
! O

My O
friend O
and O
I O
had O
brunch B-AS
the O
coffee O
was O
cold O
, O
too O
much O
worcestershire O
sauce B-AS
in O
the O
bloody O
mary O
. O

The O
Scene B-AS
Superfine O
is O
an O
easygoing O
, O
instantly O
appreciable O
neighborhood O
hangout O
that O
boasts O
a O
kitchen B-AS
staff I-AS
armed O
with O
serious O
cooking B-AS
chops I-AS
. O

The O
burger B-AS
was O
just O
a O
big O
klump O
of O
dry O
meat B-AS
with O
1 O
slice O
of O
cheese O
. O

The O
menu O
consists O
of O
a O
tasting O
selection B-AS
, O
Austrian B-AS
, O
traditional O
American B-AS
, O
and O
the O
chef B-AS
' O
s O
recommended O
menu O
. O

Check O
out O
the O
little O
room O
with O
the O
red B-AS
seats I-AS
and O
candles B-AS
and O
get O
a O
green O
dragon O
saketini O
- O
it O
' O
s O
worth O
the O
NYC O
cocktail B-AS
price I-AS
( O
$ O
14 O
) O
. O

The O
food O
was O
awful O
and O
took O
forever O
to O
arrive O
- O
which O
considering O
the O
limited O
menu B-AS
, O
few O
diners B-AS
and O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
ordered O
chili B-AS
, O
mac B-AS
cheese I-AS
and O
a O
grill O
cheese O
was O
annoying O
. O

50 O
, O
I O
got O
the O
Paella O
Marinera O
which O
was O
beyond O
filling O
in O
itself O
, O
but O
before O
it O
even O
came O
, O
the O
waitstaff B-AS
provided O
more O
than O
ample B-AS
appetizers I-AS
for O
my O
group O
that O
by O
the O
time O
that O
the O
meal O
came O
to O
us O
, O
we O
were O
so O
stuffed O
, O
we O
could O
barely O
finish O
up O
the O
meal O
. O

Keep O
in O
mind O
, O
no O
one O
else O
was O
even O
in O
the O
restaurant O
and O
we O
were O
asking O
the O
waitress B-AS
questions O
about O
entree B-AS
options I-AS
. O

The O
waitress B-AS
was O
unbelievably O
rude O
to O
my O
friend O
and O
myself O
when O
she O
realized O
that O
we O
were O
ordering O
appetizers B-AS
as O
our O
entrees B-AS
. O

Our O
waiter B-AS
was O
pushing O
us O
all O
night O
to O
take O
our O
plates B-AS
, O
and O
swiped O
my O
dessert B-AS
before O
I O
was O
finised O
with O
it O
. O

The O
word B-AS
chicken I-AS
was O
barely O
out O
of O
my O
mouth O
when O
the O
waiter B-AS
rushed O
away O
from O
my O
table O
without O
asking O
me O
about O
side O
orders O
or O
a O
drink B-AS
. O

Unlike O
some O
of O
the O
other O
reviews O
here O
, O
the O
reservation B-AS
was O
upheld O
, O
the O
waiter B-AS
took O
the O
time O
to O
explain O
each O
dish B-AS
and O
frequently O
asked O
if O
we O
wanted O
more O
of O
anything O
( O
which O
we O
did O
, O
several O
times O
) O
. O

Main O
dishes O
encompass O
the O
usuals O
- O
- O
like O
chocolatey O
chicken O
mole O
and O
grilled B-AS
flank I-AS
steak I-AS
- O
- O
well O
as O
seasonal O
specials B-AS
, O
like O
soft O
- O
shell O
crabs O
with O
orange O
tequila O
sauce O
. O

their O
filet B-AS
mignon I-AS
was O
prepared O
very O
well O
but O
lacked O
the O
flavor O
and O
savvy O
I O
generally O
require O
food B-AS
at O
that O
price O
to O
have O
. O

Upon O
entering O
, O
I O
was O
impressed O
by O
the O
room O
while O
the O
food B-AS
on O
other O
peoples O
' O
tables B-AS
seemed O
enticing O
. O

The O
place B-AS
was O
extremely O
busy O
, O
and O
with O
food B-AS
like O
this O
why O
not O
. O

Some O
other O
appetizers B-AS
fell O
short O
of O
expectations O
though O
( O
ie O
, O
good O
, O
but O
not O
worth O
the O
price O
) O
, O
like O
the O
tempura O
and O
veggies B-AS
. O

The O
highlight O
of O
the O
night O
was O
the O
mayonaisse B-AS
for O
my O
side O
of O
fries B-AS
I O
received O
from O
one O
of O
the O
food B-AS
runners I-AS
, O
which O
is O
not O
good O
considering O
the O
bill B-AS
was O
nearly O
$ O
100 O
. O

After O
taking O
unusually O
long O
to O
bring O
the O
wine O
, O
the O
waiter B-AS
could O
not O
open O
the O
bottle B-AS
and O
had O
to O
get O
a O
different O
one O
. O

UNREAL O
LUNCH B-AS
can O
' O
t O
go O
wrong O
with O
pastas B-AS
or O
sandwiches B-AS
, O
thin O
crust B-AS
pizza I-AS
is O
good O
, O
would O
steer O
away O
from O
the O
deep O
dish B-AS
. O

Waiters B-AS
and O
busboys O
were O
taking O
our O
water B-AS
glasses I-AS
and O
the O
tip O
tray O
off O
the O
table O
before O
we O
had O
counted O
the O
change O
. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
the O
meal B-AS
the O
manager B-AS
stopped O
by O
and O
said O
dessert B-AS
was O
on O
her O
. O

Went O
to O
Public O
last O
Saturday O
, O
couldn O
' O
t O
get O
a O
table B-AS
so O
the O
lovely O
host B-AS
suggested O
that O
my O
partner O
and O
I O
dine O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
. O

A O
basic O
sandwich O
/ O
burger O
menu B-AS
is O
also O
served O
for O
pre B-AS
- I-AS
ice I-AS
cream I-AS
nourishment I-AS
- O
- O
just O
always O
remember O
to O
leave O
room O
for O
dessert B-AS
! O
! O

The O
food B-AS
at O
Parish O
was O
tasy O
and O
well O
- O
prepared O
, O
but O
the O
portions B-AS
were O
absurdly O
miniscule O
, O
especially O
in O
proportion O
to O
the O
prices B-AS
. O

Diners O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
watch O
busy O
chefs O
scoop O
lobster B-AS
salad I-AS
onto O
warm O
brioche B-AS
rolls I-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
below O
average O
, O
I O
' O
m O
not O
a O
great O
cook O
and O
I O
could O
have O
cooked O
a O
better O
meal B-AS
. O

I O
dined O
at O
Belleville O
and O
my O
meal B-AS
was O
distrupted O
by O
the O
manager B-AS
yelling O
at O
the O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
dining O
room B-AS
. O

Even O
if O
you O
have O
to O
wait O
a O
bit O
for O
a O
reservation B-AS
, O
the O
hostess B-AS
will O
come O
over O
to O
apologize O
, O
update O
you O
on O
the O
wait O
and O
make O
sure O
you O
are O
comfortable O
. O

i O
ordered O
non B-AS
- I-AS
sushi I-AS
rolls I-AS
and O
enjoyed O
my O
meal B-AS
. O

There O
are O
no O
vegetarian O
items O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
but O
when O
I O
requested O
that O
the O
chef B-AS
make O
something O
meat O
- O
free O
for O
me O
, O
he O
came O
through O
with O
a O
dish B-AS
just O
as O
delicious O
and O
pretty O
as O
those O
my O
friends O
were O
eating O
. O

My O
friend O
and O
I O
were O
the O
ONLY O
2 O
people O
in O
the O
entire O
place O
seated B-AS
for O
dinner B-AS
and O
after O
sitting O
there O
for O
15 O
minutes O
, O
I O
had O
to O
walk O
over O
to O
our O
surly O
waiter B-AS
and O
ask O
for O
menus O
. O

The O
veal B-AS
was O
nice O
and O
tender O
, O
but O
the O
flavors B-AS
weren O
' O
t O
exciting O
. O

The O
handwritten B-AS
menu I-AS
makes O
me O
think O
the O
choices O
change O
frequently O
- O
- O
we O
started O
with O
pumpkin O
fritters O
and O
then O
had O
bunny O
rabbit B-AS
and O
sea B-AS
bass I-AS
cakes I-AS
. O

it O
is O
too O
bad O
because O
the O
food B-AS
, O
ambiance B-AS
, O
and O
drinks B-AS
were O
great O
but O
they O
need O
serious O
help O
on O
the O
service B-AS
. O

After O
sitting O
without O
any O
beverages B-AS
for O
about O
fifteen O
minutes O
, O
the O
manager B-AS
got O
up O
and O
poured O
a O
glass B-AS
of I-AS
water I-AS
for O
his O
smacking O
companion O
. O

It O
was O
super O
busy O
, O
but O
our O
waiter B-AS
still O
had O
time O
to O
chat O
, O
and O
knew O
the O
menu B-AS
very O
well O
. O

When O
I O
asked O
for O
a O
particular O
drink B-AS
, O
the O
waitress B-AS
gave O
me O
dirty O
look O
and O
annoyed O
b O
/ O
c O
they O
didn O
' O
t O
know O
what O
it O
was O
. O

huuge O
portions B-AS
, O
which O
made O
it O
much O
easier O
paying O
the O
$ O
350 O
bill B-AS
. O

BTW O
, O
the O
prices B-AS
are O
very O
affordable O
, O
which O
make O
the O
mediocer O
service B-AS
tolerable O
. O

and O
don O
' O
t O
be O
ashamed O
to O
ask O
for O
more O
during O
the O
hour O
long O
wait B-AS
for O
your O
entrees B-AS
. O

What O
we O
were O
treated O
to O
, O
instead O
, O
was O
snooty O
attitude O
by O
the O
waiter O
and O
the O
maitre B-AS
d O
' O
and O
a O
dinner B-AS
I O
couldn O
' O
t O
eat O
. O

Still O
my O
favorite O
part O
of O
the O
restaurant O
and O
bar B-AS
adjacent O
are O
the O
drinks B-AS
. O

A O
cold O
reception O
got O
even O
colder O
when O
we O
didn O
' O
t O
have O
a O
reservation B-AS
for O
a O
Tuesday O
night O
( O
the O
place B-AS
was O
half O
empty O
) O
. O

I O
don O
' O
t O
know O
why O
the O
place B-AS
was O
almost O
empty O
until O
8PM O
, O
but O
the O
food B-AS
and O
service O
were O
perfect O
for O
the O
price B-AS
. O

Ignoring O
the O
merits O
of O
the O
cuisine O
( O
which O
was O
par O
at O
best O
) O
, O
I O
see O
no O
reason O
why O
one O
would O
pay O
Da O
Umberto O
prices B-AS
for O
an O
okay O
meal B-AS
and O
below O
average O
ambience O
. O

We O
tried O
their O
new O
menu B-AS
that O
just O
started O
last O
Wednesday O
a O
combination O
of O
4 O
different O
kind O
of O
ceviches O
and O
4 O
kinds O
of O
Tiradito O
, O
of O
course O
you O
can O
' O
t O
go O
wrong O
with O
spicy O
Tuna B-AS
Rolls I-AS
and O
The O
Peruvian B-AS
Corn I-AS
mmmm O
! O

Even O
with O
reservations B-AS
, O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
20 O
minutes O
until O
our O
server B-AS
came O
to O
take O
our O
order O
, O
then O
waited O
an O
HOUR O
10 O
minutes O
for O
our O
food B-AS
! O

It O
takes O
forever O
for O
them O
to O
serve O
you O
just O
drinks B-AS
, O
and O
some O
of O
the O
waiters B-AS
seem O
to O
not O
comprehend O
what O
you O
order O
. O

The O
next O
thing O
we O
know O
, O
the O
bartender B-AS
comes O
over O
and O
says O
( O
and O
I O
quote O
verbatim O
) O
, O
I O
already O
gave O
you O
two O
beers B-AS
( O
which O
he O
hadn O
' O
t O
) O
. O

I O
did O
not O
try O
the O
caviar B-AS
but O
I O
tried O
their O
salmon B-AS
and I-AS
crab I-AS
salad I-AS
( O
they O
are O
all O
good O
) O
It O
is O
definitely O
a O
good O
spot O
for O
snacks O
and O
chat O
. O

i O
would O
not O
go O
after O
the O
early O
bird O

The O
noise B-AS

entered O

without O

they O
lowered O
the O
lights O

To O
complain O
about O

a O
table B-AS

We O
got O
there O
a O
bit O
early O
and O
the O
staff B-AS
wasn O
' O
t O
ready O
for O
us O
but O
we O
didn O
' O
t O
mind O
b O
/ O
c O
we O
got O
to O
wait O
by O
the O
beautiful O
bar B-AS

Seemed O
to O
be O
many O
problems O
just O
getting O
our O
appetizers B-AS
out O
( O
guacamole B-AS
, O
which O
was O
delicious O
when O
it O
finally O
came O
) O
and O
we O
were O
there O
an O
hour O
before O
entrees O
arrived O
. O

We O
figured O
we O
never O
had O
Argentinian B-AS
Pizza I-AS
before O
so O
we O
grabbed O
our O
lunch B-AS
there O
, O
sharing O
a O
large O
Pelligrino B-AS
, O
a O
pizza O
of O
two O
of O
their O
specials O
, O
one O
was O
goat B-AS
cheese I-AS
the O
other O
blue B-AS
cheese I-AS
, O
and O
both O
were O
excellent O
. O

There O
are O
several O
specials B-AS
that O
change O
daily O
, O
which O
the O
servers B-AS
recite O
from O
memory O
. O

Bringing O
a O
large O
group O
on O
a O
busy O
Saturday O
night O
, O
I O
was O
afraid O
quality B-AS
of I-AS
food I-AS
and O
service O
might O
not O
be O
up O
to O
par O
, O
but O
we O
were O
seated B-AS
promptly O
and O
the O
service O
by O
our O
waitress B-AS
was O
fantastic O
considering O
how O
busy O
it O
was O
. O

While O
the O
place B-AS
looks O
rather O
small O
and O
undecorated O
, O
I O
will O
definitely O
go O
back O
just O
for O
the O
food B-AS
. O

I O
used O
to O
live O
in O
Japan O
, O
and O
have O
had O
some O
pretty O
good O
raw O
fish B-AS
, O
but O
I O
was O
blown O
away O
by O
the O
Chef B-AS
' O
s O
tasting O
plate B-AS
, O
which O
includes O
6 O
appetizers B-AS
including O
a O
stunning B-AS
octopus I-AS
portion I-AS
and O
some O
incredible O
sashimi B-AS
. O

All O
this O
Asian O
fusion O
craze O
leaves O
one O
feeling O
like O
they O
should O
' O
ve O
went O
to O
an O
authentic O
Thai B-AS
or O
Indian O
restaurant O
for O
probably O
1 O
/ O
3 O
of O
the O
price B-AS
of O
Spice B-AS
Market O
. O

Park O
your O
trench O
coat O
at O
the O
coat B-AS
check I-AS
and O
be O
prepared O
for O
fine O
dining B-AS
, O
expert O
/ O
attentive O
table B-AS
service I-AS
and O
a O
delectable O
cuisine B-AS
. O

The O
fruit B-AS
that O
came O
with O
the O
fondu B-AS
was O
perfectly O
ripe O
, O
no O
bruises O
at O
all O
. O

Instead O
of O
doing O
so O
, O
the O
manager B-AS
came O
to O
our O
table B-AS
and O
told O
us O
he O
' O
d O
be O
happy O
to O
take O
our O
orders O
off O
if O
we O
didn O
' O
t O
like O
the O
way O
he O
ran O
his O
restaurant O
. O

My O
friends O
and O
I O
had O
a O
great O
time O
- O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
was O
exciting O
but O
didn O
' O
t O
encroach O
on O
us O
while O
we O
had O
our O
meal B-AS
and O
drinks O
( O
which O
is O
better O
, O
the O
kiwitini O
or O
the O
watermelon O
martini O
? O
) O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
was O
nice O
( O
tables B-AS
were O
a O
bit O
too O
close O
together O
) O
and O
trendy O
, O
but O
waiters O
seemed O
rushed O
. O

Recommend O
eating O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
for O
an O
intimate O
, O
relaxed O
dinner B-AS
. O

Went O
with O
a O
large O
group O
of O
7 O
ladies O
before O
a O
show O
, O
and O
the O
staff B-AS
was O
extremely O
obliging O
, O
even O
when O
one O
person O
was O
late O
and O
we O
had O
to O
wrap O
up O
her O
dinner B-AS
to O
take O
to O
her O
. O

Jalepeno B-AS
slices I-AS
and O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
cheese B-AS
, O
yes O
again O
them O
hamburgers B-AS
make O
me O
weak O
in O
my O
knees O
. O

I O
love O
the O
food B-AS
, O
and O
have O
gone O
back O
several O
times O
, O
but O
each O
time O
the O
waitress B-AS
is O
a O
little O
nastier O
. O

Desserts B-AS
were O
visually O
inventive O
but O
lacking O
in O
flavor B-AS
. O

And O
price B-AS
is O
over O
value O
for O
two O
persons O
dinner B-AS
$ O
90 O
. O

We O
also O
had O
an O
extra O
appetizer O
- O
some O
sort B-AS
of I-AS
fish I-AS
roll I-AS
, O
which O
was O
dipped O
in O
spicy O
sauce B-AS
. O

went O
here O
w O
/ O
great O
expectations O
and O
was O
greatly O
disappointed O
; O
the O
food B-AS
was O
good O
, O
not O
great O
and O
vastly O
overpriced O
- O
one O
salad O
, O
two O
pasta O
dishes O
, O
two O
demi O
- O
carafes O
of O
red O
wine O
- O
$ O
100 O
( O
tax O
and O
tip O
) O
; O
rediculous O
; O
orechiette O
came O
w O
/ O
so O
little O
brocoli O
rape O
that O
it O
did O
not O
have O
its O
characteristic O
flavor B-AS
; O
and O
it O
is O
very O
very O
loud O
. O

We O
went O
there O
just O
for O
dinner B-AS
, O
and O
the O
place B-AS
was O
so O
good O
we O
didn O
' O
t O
leave O
. O

The O
ambience B-AS
is O
cool O
, O
and O
the O
cocktails O
might O
be O
worth O
coming O
by O
, O
but O
head O
somewhere O
else O
for O
dinner B-AS
. O

When O
her O
boyfriend O
told O
the O
host B-AS
that O
she O
would O
like O
to O
keep O
her O
seat B-AS
as O
it O
was O
, O
he O
grabbed O
a O
chair O
and O
slammed O
it O
down O
very O
hard O
on O
the O
floor O
. O

my O
boyfriend O
' O
s O
fish B-AS
was O
overwhelmed O
by O
the O
sauce B-AS
. O

The O
Bollos B-AS
appetizer I-AS
, O
this O
deliciouss O
black O
bean O
, O
roasted B-AS
corn I-AS
fritter I-AS
w I-AS
/ I-AS
a I-AS
tsty I-AS
dipping I-AS
sauce I-AS
and O
the O
Mahi B-AS
Mahi I-AS
was O
grilled O
just O
right O
. O

Our O
waitress B-AS
seemed O
less O
than O
happy O
about O
the O
prix O
fixe O
dinner O
choices O
and O
at O
one O
point O
said O
, O
Do O
you O
really O
need O
to O
hear O
the O
specials B-AS
? O

Setting O
aside O
the O
interminable O
wait B-AS
for O
food B-AS
, O
the O
cheese B-AS
omelet I-AS
opened O
up O
on O
the O
way O
from O
the O
kitchen O
to O
the O
table B-AS
so O
that O
when O
it O
arrived O
, O
it O
looked O
like O
a O
large O
yellow B-AS
pancake I-AS
with O
a O
slab O
of O
uncooked O
cheese O
sitting O
in O
the O
middle O
. O

The O
staff B-AS
is O
nice O
, O
but O
they O
have O
the O
awful O
job O
of O
having O
to O
sell O
bland O
food B-AS
as O
amazing O
treats O
. O

This O
is O
the O
perfect O
place O
to O
come O
with O
a O
group O
from O
work O
, O
people O
from O
out O
of O
town O
, O
or O
just O
to O
have O
a O
drink B-AS
at O
the O
bar B-AS
and O
enjoy O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
. O

There O
is O
a O
litte O
bit O
of O
a O
wait B-AS
on O
the O
food B-AS
, O
but O
it O
is O
well O
worth O
it O
! O

but O
above O
all O
, O
they O
do O
have O
fresh O
fish B-AS
, O
especially O
salmon B-AS
and O
yellowtail B-AS
. O

The O
calamari B-AS
, O
the O
penne B-AS
and I-AS
vodka I-AS
sauce I-AS
, O
the O
friendly O
service B-AS
the O
parking O
and O
the O
open B-AS
area I-AS
kitchen I-AS
to O
see O
all O
the O
action O
in O
the O
making O
! O

One O
server B-AS
came O
and O
gave O
us O
food B-AS
that O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
someone O
else O
' O
s O
. O

Perhaps O
it O
' O
s O
early O
and O
they O
will O
improve O
but O
service B-AS
is O
VERY O
slow O
- O
took O
a O
good O
25min O
for O
waiter B-AS
to O
take O
our O
order O
on O
both O
visits O
and O
the O
second O
time O
I O
was O
one O
of O
three O
tables B-AS
at O
a O
5 O
: O
30pm O
reservation B-AS
so O
not O
like O
it O
was O
busy O
. O

Even O
with O
our O
large O
appetites O
we O
could O
not O
finish O
all O
the O
food B-AS
or O
wine B-AS
, O
which O
has O
never O
happened O
with O
a O
tasting O
menu B-AS
before O
. O

The O
chef B-AS
/ I-AS
owner I-AS
is O
always O
walking O
around O
making O
sure O
everyone O
is O
having O
a O
good O
time B-AS
. O

A O
shrimp B-AS
dish I-AS
that O
was O
boiled O
and O
in O
a O
sauce B-AS
that O
tasted O
like O
unflavored O
jello B-AS
. O

After O
losing O
our O
reservation B-AS
the O
staff B-AS
at O
March O
called O
24 O
hours O
later O
to O
apologize O
and O
ask O
if O
we O
would O
still O
like O
to O
dine O
there O
. O

Enough O
space B-AS
between O
tables B-AS
that O
you O
don O
' O
t O
feel O
crowded O
or O
that O
it O
' O
s O
too O
loud O
. O

This O
is O
a O
wonderful O
mix B-AS
of O
food B-AS
from O
Turkey B-AS
and O
the O
Caucasus B-AS
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
messed O
up O
my O
order O
and O
we O
had O
to O
hunt O
down O
the O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
to O
get O
a O
second O
drink B-AS
. O

Unfortunately O
for O
them O
, O
we O
would O
have O
ordered O
twice O
as O
many O
drinks B-AS
if O
we O
didn O
' O
t O
have O
to O
wait O
half O
an O
hour O
for O
the O
waitress B-AS
between O
every O
drink O
. O

For O
such O
an O
expensive O
place B-AS
, O
you O
can O
find O
much O
, O
much O
better O
in O
Manhattan O
; O
heck O
, O
you O
can O
find O
much O
better O
food B-AS
for O
a O
lot O
cheaper O
! O

Appetizers B-AS
: O
those O
that O
we O
tried O
were O
good O
, O
though O
skip O
the O
soup B-AS
, O
cuz O
you O
can O
eat O
that O
at O
home O
since O
it O
tasted O
like O
Campbells O
. O

Asking O
for O
the O
menu B-AS
is O
out O
of O
line O
and O
unusual O
where O
the O
staff B-AS
is O
actually O
insulted O
if O
you O
choose O
not O
to O
rely O
on O
their O
expertise O
on O
average O
Chinese O
food O
selections O
. O

For O
lunch B-AS
, O
walk O
in O
slightly O
after O
1pm O
to O
avoid O
long O
lines B-AS
. O

Like O
the O
previous O
reviewer O
said O
, O
the O
appetizers B-AS
were O
by O
far O
the O
best O
part O
( O
chipotle O
chicken B-AS
wings O
) O
. O

The O
complimentary O
salmon B-AS
with I-AS
horseradish I-AS
sauce I-AS
was O
delicious O
and O
I O
don O
' O
t O
even O
like O
eating O
fish B-AS
. O

The O
plain B-AS
slice I-AS
is O
a O
bit O
pricey O
for O
what O
you O
get O
sometimes O
, O
but O
the O
pre B-AS
- I-AS
made I-AS
multi I-AS
- I-AS
topping I-AS
slices I-AS
are O
a O
bargain O
at O
$ O
3 O
a O
pop O
. O

I O
tried O
both O
and O
definitley O
thought O
the O
duck B-AS
was O
amazing O
, O
I O
' O
m O
not O
generally O
not O
a O
big O
fan O
of O
lamb B-AS
shank O
but O
thought O
they O
did O
a O
good O
job O
here O
. O

I O
don O
' O
t O
expect O
an O
enormous O
, O
heaping O
plate B-AS
of O
food B-AS
, O
but O
c O
' O
mon O
. O

The O
ubiquitous O
nasty O
plastic B-AS
cheese I-AS
bread I-AS
that O
passes O
for O
pizza B-AS
in O
too O
many O
NYC O
establishments O
these O
days O
. O

Once O
we O
had O
ordered O
etc O
, O
the O
wait B-AS
for O
our O
meal B-AS
was O
not O
long O
and O
the O
food B-AS
was O
fabulous O
. O

Much O
to O
my O
satisfaction O
, O
I O
was O
seated O
promptly O
without O
a O
reservation B-AS
and O
soon O
after O
being O
seated O
was O
greeted O
by O
my O
server B-AS
. O

Out O
waitress B-AS
never O
came O
back O
to O
our O
table O
after O
taking O
our O
food B-AS
orders O
. O

Diners B-AS
choose O
between O
deep O
banquettes O
or O
seats B-AS
at O
the O
bar B-AS
, O
which O
offer O
a O
front O
- O
row O
view O
of O
the O
small O
preparation O
area B-AS
and O
a O
chance O
to O
watch O
the O
two O
chefs B-AS
as O
they O
whip O
together O
the O
elegantly O
constructed O
desserts O
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
kept O
pestering O
us O
for O
our O
order O
even O
though O
we O
were O
among O
the O
last O
diners B-AS
. O

The O
waitress B-AS
lost O
some O
points O
for O
not O
refilling O
our O
champagne B-AS
glasses I-AS
. O

Tried O
again O
for O
Brunch B-AS
and O
really O
bad O
server B-AS
with O
HUGE O
attitude O
. O

Also O
, O
try O
to O
get O
a O
seat B-AS
at O
the O
main B-AS
bar I-AS
, O
because O
I O
sat O
at O
the O
smaller O
bar O
by O
the O
entrance O
and O
it O
was O
getting O
so O
crowded O
with O
people O
waiting B-AS
that O
it O
became O
a O
bit O
unpleasant O
towards O
to O
end O
of O
the O
meal B-AS
. O

The O
waitress B-AS
was O
slow O
and O
forgot O
drinks B-AS
and O
food O
we O
ordered O
. O

Fajitas O
, O
a O
house O
specialty O
, O
are O
available O
with O
nearly O
a O
dozen O
different O
fillings B-AS
, O
from O
mesquite O
- O
grilled O
chicken B-AS
to I-AS
portobello I-AS
mushrooms I-AS
and O
asparagus B-AS
. O

We O
had O
to O
remind O
the O
waiter B-AS
to O
pour O
our O
wine B-AS
( O
white B-AS
) O
and O
then O
he O
didn O
' O
t O
show O
us O
the O
label O
. O

Those O
of O
you O
who O
are O
sick O
of O
the O
standard O
Italian B-AS
fare I-AS
will O
be O
blown O
away O
by O
the O
food B-AS
at O
Arezzo O
. O

The O
value B-AS
for O
this O
place O
was O
great O
- O
- O
we O
had O
2 O
drinks B-AS
, O
2 O
appetizers B-AS
, O
2 O
entrees B-AS
, O
and O
1 O
chocolate B-AS
cake I-AS
( O
yummy O
! O
! O
) O

Perhaps O
it O
was O
because O
the O
20 O
% O
tip B-AS
was O
already O
added O
to O
the O
bill B-AS
, O
but O
the O
waiter B-AS
brought O
us O
plain O
gazpacho O
without O
any O
of O
the O
other O
ingredients O
described O
on O
the O
menu O
; O
later O
, O
when O
we O
complained O
, O
he O
brought O
us O
saucers O
of O
garnish O
instead O
of O
new O
bowls O
of O
the O
soup B-AS
properly O
prepared B-AS
. O

Even O
when O
the O
place O
has O
been O
packed O
with O

the O
waiters B-AS

bartenders O
are O
still O
nice O
. O

the O
fillet B-AS
minion I-AS
was O
a O
little O
too O
salty O
and O
the O
chicken B-AS
was O
average O
but O
the O
side O
dishes O
with O
each O
meat O
was O
amazing O
. O

When O
the O
other O
half O
of O
my O
party O
arrived O
, O
the O
waited O
helped O
us O
with O
the O
menu B-AS

got O
the O

and O
i O
could O
not O
believe O
how O
great O
the O
pork B-AS
sandwich I-AS
was O
, O
I O
also O
enjoyed O
the O
asian B-AS
salad I-AS
and O
brownie O
tremendously O
. O

Those O
who O
choose O
an O
omakase B-AS

be O
happily O
surprised O
with O
accents O
of O
jalapeno O
or O
swaths O
of O
homemade O
sauce O
cleverly O
accenting O
rolls O
and O

alike I-AS

. O

If O
only O
they O
' O
d O
get O
a O
better O
wine O
list O
- O
the O
reds B-AS
are O
all O
so O
mediocre O
- O
this O
would O
be O
the O
perfect O
meal B-AS
. O

Despite O
a O
slightly O
snotty O
server B-AS
( O
our O
waitress B-AS
was O
great O
) O
I O
cant O
wait O
to O
hop O
back O
on O
the O
L O
train O
and O
cruz O
on O
over O
. O

$ O
45 O
a O
head O
with O
tip O
for O
bad O
gnocchi O
, O
mediocre O
wine B-AS
( O
as O
recommended O
by O
a O
condescending O
waiter O
, O
who O
thought O
himself O
oh O
- O
so O
- O
nice O
) O
and O
the O
feeling O
that O
our O
companions O
( O
at O
our O
shared B-AS
table I-AS
) O
were O
listening O
in O
on O
all O
our O
chatter O
. O

The O
decor B-AS
maybe O
great O
for O
young O
kids O
but O
as O
an O
adult O
this O
place B-AS
was O
an O
horrible O
experiance O
, O
it O
didn O
' O
t O
bring O
the O
kid O
in O
me O
. O

Large O
portions B-AS
of O
food B-AS
to O
share O
. O

The O
steak B-AS
is O
brought O
to O
the O
table B-AS
soaked O
in O
grease O
. O

Best O
value B-AS
is O
the O
sushi B-AS
/ I-AS
sashimi I-AS
lunch I-AS
combo I-AS
- O
get O
the O
large O
for O
double O
pieces O
on O
sushi O
! O

My O
grandmother O
- O
in O
- O
law O
had O
a O
problem O
with O
her O
meal B-AS
, O
and O
the O
manager B-AS
AND O
chef B-AS
came O
over O
and O
offered O
to O
replace O
it O
and O
/ O
or O
take O
it O
off O
the O
check O
. O

Although O
the O
sushi B-AS
was O
fresh O
, O
I O
was O
disappointed O
with O
the O
size O
of O
the O
portions B-AS
for O
the O
price B-AS
. O

AVOID O
- O
there O
are O
WAY O
better O
pre O
- O
theater O
places B-AS
, O
like O
Orso O
, O
Hell O
' O
s O
Kitchen B-AS
, O
etc O
for O
the O
same O
price O
. O

You O
can O
' O
t O
fault O
them O
for O
serving B-AS
up O
some O
pretty O
good O
food B-AS
, O
even O
if O
it O
' O
s O
a O
bit O
overpriced O
. O

This O
place B-AS
is O
cheap O
and O
so O
much O
better O
for O
spending O
your O
football O
Sunday O
than O
the O
nightmarishly O
crowded O
Times O
Square O
ESPN O
Zone O
or O
a O
more O
trendy O
sports O
bar B-AS
. O

My O
favorites O
: O
warm O
veal B-AS
with I-AS
goat I-AS
cheese I-AS
( O
just O
melts O
in O
your O
mouth O
) O
, O
the O
gnocchi B-AS
with I-AS
crab I-AS
meat I-AS
, O
and O
for O
dessert B-AS
- O
the O
beignets O
are O
unbelievable O
. O

Two O
of O
us O
could O
eat O
a O
full O
meal B-AS
with O
two O
desserts B-AS
and O
a O
salad B-AS
for O
$ O
40 O
. O

Spend O
your O
time O
sitting O
on O
one O
of O
their O
couches O
enjoying O
a O
cocktail B-AS
from O
the O
bar B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
delicious O
, O
and O
the O
menu B-AS
provided O
ample O
choices B-AS
which O
suited O
all O
of O
the O
eaters O
in O
our O
party O
from O
the O
most O
daring O
to O
the O
most O
conservative O
. O

nicely O
decorated O
with O
cool O
rock B-AS
and O
roll O
photos O
and O
after O
dinner B-AS
the O
nightlife O
tends O
to O
pick O
up O
. O

My O
husband O
had O
the O
mesclun B-AS
, O
salmon B-AS
, O
and O
ice B-AS
cream I-AS
and O
he O
enjoyed O
all O
3 O
courses B-AS
. O

Brunch B-AS
is O
what O
Friend O
of O
a O
Farmer O
is O
known O
for O
, O
however O
dinner B-AS
is O
equally O
impressive O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
Italian O
staples O
like O
pasta O
, O
chicken O
and O
veal B-AS
parmigiana I-AS
, O
house O
specials O
like O
chicken O
Giovanni O
( O

wine I-AS
) O
and O
linguini B-AS
Giovanni I-AS
( O
shrimp O
and O
clams O
in O
red O
sauce O
) O
keep O
the O
menu B-AS
interesting I-AS
. O

Even O
more O
impressive O
, O
when O
my O
vegetarian O
girlfriend O
started O
asking O
whether O
certain O
dishes B-AS
were O
made O
with O
meat O
, O
the O
waiter B-AS
offered O
to O
have O
a O
vegetable B-AS
plate I-AS
created O
for O
her O
- O
- O
and O
it O
was O
quite O
well O
done O
too O
. O

Not O
ony O
did O
our O
waiter B-AS
impose O
on O
the O
dessert B-AS
we O
were O
trying O
to O
enjoy O
to O
take O
the O
money B-AS
- O
- O
he O
didn O
' O
t O
even O
ask O
us O
if O
we O
wanted O
change O
- O
- O
nor O
did O
he O
bring O
us O
back O
any O
! O
! O
! O

After O
my O
friend O
and O
I O
were O
seated O
, O
we O
were O
greeted O
by O
a O
gorgeous O
waitress B-AS
, O
who O
helped O
us O
make O
our O
way O
through O
the O
large O
selection O
of O
choices O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
. O

We O
were O
not O
rushed O
at O
all O
, O
and O
the O
manager B-AS
comped O
drinks B-AS
at O
the O
bar B-AS
so O
that O
we O
would O
vacate O
our O
table O
for O
a O
birthday O
girl O
who O
had O
to O
wait O
. O

I O
expected O
there O
to O
be O
more O
options O
for O
tapas B-AS
the O
food O
was O
mediocre O
but O
the O
service B-AS
was O
pretty O
good O
. O

We O
were O
able O
to O
get O
a O
table O
right O
away O
on O
Friday O
night O
, O
but O
we O
only O
saw O
our O
server B-AS
twice O
and O
he O
failed O
to O
give O
us O
the O
specials B-AS
, O
we O
overheard O
him O
tell O
the O
table O
right O
next O
to O
us O
after O
we O
had O
ordered O
and O
were O
already O
into O
our O
salads B-AS
. O

The O
oil B-AS
is O
changed O
frequently O
, O
and O
the O
food B-AS
never O
tastes O
TOO O
HEAVY O
. O

We O
were O
hassled O
about O
seating O
by O
our O
waiter B-AS
who O
seemed O
at O
the O
end O
of O
his O
pony O
- O
tail O
, O
so O
we O
opted O
for O
the O
bar B-AS
, O
quaintly O
decorated O
with O
giant O
fly O
strips O
. O

Pizza O
is O
supposed O
to O
have O
an O
extremely O
thin O
crust B-AS
, O
and O
a O
sauce O
which O
is O
actually O
made O
of O
crushed O
tomatoes O
instead O
of O
tomato B-AS
paste I-AS
. O

One O
thing O
that O
is O
great O
is O
there O
is O
a O
pitcher O
of O
water B-AS
at O
each O
table O
, O
great O
for O
people O
who O
can O
' O
t O
handle O
the O
spices B-AS
. O

The O
filet O
was O
NOT O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
but O
my O
friend O
had O
the O
bouillabaisse B-AS
, O
which O
he O
found O
delicious O
. O

I O
agree O
that O
the O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
wasn O
' O
t O
very O
friendly O
, O
but O
the O
service B-AS
was O
adequate O
and O
our O
food B-AS
arrived O
without O
too O
much O
of O
a O
wait O
. O

I O
highly O
suggest O
you O
make O
reservations B-AS
, O
as O
wait B-AS
times O
can O
be O
extremely O
long O
. O

Our O
server B-AS
was O
just O
fantastic O
, O
she O
recommended O
that O
we O
order O
a O
lot O
of O
different O
dishes B-AS
, O
so O
we O
did O
, O
we O
tried O
almost O
everything O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
we O
were O
a O
party O
of O
six O
and O
the O
whole O
group O
enjoyed O
everything O
. O

Management B-AS
had O
always O
been O
rude O
, O
but O
without O
the O
great O
staff O
as O
a O
buffer O
, O
Jesse O
' O
s O
is O
just O
another O
pubby O
place O
with O
poor O
decor B-AS
and O
average O
food B-AS
. O

Theme O
and O
actors B-AS
are O
kinda O
cool O
but O
you O
are O
charged O
some O
entertainment O
fee O
on O
top O
of O
the O
expensive O
food B-AS
and O
drinks B-AS
. O

the O
specials B-AS
were O
excellent O
, O
everything O
was O
delicious O
down O
to O
the O
olive B-AS
oil I-AS
they O
serve O
when O
you O
sit O
down O
. O

The O
white O
tablecloths O

After O
leaving O
the O
traditional O

% O
tip B-AS
, O
the O
waiter B-AS
ran O
after O
us O
for O
half O
a O
block O
to O
confront O
. O

Dominic O
will O
give O
you O
the O
ambience B-AS
of O
the O
old O
times O
when O
they O
were O
all O
immigrants O
and O
good O
food B-AS
was O
equivalent O
of O
good O
friends O
and O
unforgettable O
times O
. O

The O
waiters B-AS
, O
all O
wearing O
black O
suits B-AS
, O
are O
serious O
, O
courteous O
, O
and O
knowledgeable O
; O
the O

are O
ornate O
and O
convivial O
, O
with O
large O
parties B-AS
celebrating O
various O
things O
interspersed O
with O
dressed O

up O
couples O
on O
dates O
. O

true O
I O
had O
to O
wait O
longer O
for O
my O
table B-AS
, O
but O
the O
ambience B-AS
and O
the O
food B-AS
definitely O
made O
up O
for O
it O
. O

from O
the O
legendary B-AS
Big I-AS
Mac I-AS
to O
new O
and O
exciting O
menu B-AS
items I-AS
like O
Chicken B-AS
Parm I-AS
and O
the O
Big O
Extra O
Mickey O
D O
' O
s O
is O
always O
expanding O
their O
menu O
! O

Their O
version O
of O
chicken B-AS
tikka I-AS
masala I-AS
tastes O
nothing O
like O
what O
it O
should O
- O
it O
' O
s O
basically O
chunks O
of O
chicken B-AS
with I-AS
stewed I-AS
tomatoes I-AS
, O
and O
of O
course O
, O
half O
of O
the O
dish B-AS
is O
cilantro O
. O

Well O
I O
can O
' O
t O
tell O
you O
how O
the O
food B-AS
was O
because O
the O
moment O
we O
walked O
in O
, O
the O
single B-AS
waiter I-AS
was O
extremely O
rude O
and O
told O
us O
to O
wait O
outside O
while O
he O
cleared O
a O
table B-AS
( O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
winter O
) O
because O
he O
was O
busy O
. O

( O
And O
the O
mixed B-AS
steamed I-AS
seafood I-AS
appetizer I-AS
took O
* O
forever O
* O
to O
arrive O
- O
- O
apparently O
the O
oysters B-AS
here O
are O
shucked O
by O
machine O
, O
and O
they O
only O
have O
one O
shucker O
, O
so O
if O
more O
than O
one O
table O
orders O
anything O
off O
of O
that O
section O
of O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
you O
' O
ll O
be O
waiting O
a O
while O
. O

We O
got O
the O
tasting O

( O
$ O
100 O
for O
two O
) O
, O
which O
was O
a O
selection O
of O
the O
signature O

. O

I O
went O
there O
for O

, O
flat O

After O
being O
sat O
for O

, O
we O
enjoyed O
the O
fresh O
bread B-AS
and O
butter B-AS
before O
the O
salad B-AS
and O
main O
course O
. O

But O
the O
waiter B-AS
was O
very O
accomodating O
; O
he O
brought O
extra O
garlic B-AS
bread I-AS
at O
no O
charge O
, O
was O
attentive O
, O

The O
staff B-AS
knows O
all O
about O
the O
food B-AS
and O
the O
Chef B-AS
is O
very O
visible O
visiting O
tables O
and O
overseeing O
the O

when O
the O
wine B-AS
is O
the O
best O
thing O
at O
dinner B-AS
, O
its O
not O
a O
good O
thing O
. O

My O
friend O
was O
looking O
forward O
to O
her O
favorite O
dish B-AS
on O
the O
menu B-AS
had O
made O
reservations O
for O
the O
14 O
of O
us O
a O
few O
weeks O
beforehand O
. O

I O
organized O
a O
dinner B-AS
for O
20 O
and O
was O
extremely O
satisfied O
with O
the O
results B-AS
. O

A O
friend O
and O
I O
went O
for O
dinner B-AS
, O
the O
host O
was O
rude O
to O
us O
as O
we O
walked O
in O
, O
we O
stayed O
because O
the O
decor B-AS
is O
charming O
and O
we O
wanted O
french O
food O
. O

Whole O
roasted B-AS

for O
a O
meal B-AS
. O

The O
place B-AS
was O
busy O
and O
had O
a O
bohemian O
feel B-AS
. O

The O
high O
prices B-AS
and O
small O
portions O
reflect O
the O
hype O
of O
a O
new O
Battali O
restaurant O
as O
well O
as O
the O
cache O
that O
comes O
with O
having O

Their O
Billy B-AS
- I-AS
Cheese I-AS
steak I-AS
sandwich I-AS
is O
very O
good O
, O
too O
, O
but O
last O
I O
was O
there O
it O
wasn O
' O
t O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
at O
least O
not O
for O
dinner B-AS
anyway O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
certainly O
unlike O
any O
other O
restaurant O
in O
all O
of O
Manhattan O
, O
but O
it O
is O
a O
pity O
that O
the O
food B-AS
does O
not O
live O
up O
to O
the O
decor B-AS
. O

The O
place B-AS
is O
small O
, O
but O
loaded O
with O
plenty O
of O
goodies O
that O
range O
from O
Italian O
inspired O
treats O
to O
Greek B-AS
pastries I-AS
all O
well O
prepared O
. O

I O
went O
with O
a O
friend O
from O
out O
the O
town O
- O
the O
best O
thing O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
was O
the O
Veal B-AS
. O

I O
had O
lunch B-AS
with O
3 O
friends O
of O
mine O
, O
all O
ordered O
different O
pasta B-AS
dishes I-AS
and O
we O
all O
loved O
each O
of O
ours O
! O

the O
COOKED O
STUFF O
were O
OVERCOOKED O
, O
the O
lobster B-AS
tail I-AS
was O
DRY O
, O
and O
CRAB B-AS
melted O
in O
your O
mouth O
like O
mashed B-AS
potatoes I-AS
, O
the O
salads B-AS
and O
dessert O
looked O
like O
they O
were O
lunchtime O
leftovers O
. O

Portions B-AS
are O
small O
, O
they O
try O
to O
pass O
themselves O
off O
as O
family O
style O
by O
encouraging O
sharing O
and O
putting O
dishes O
in O
the O
center O
of O
the O
table B-AS
, O
but O
it O
is O
glorified O
a O
la O
carte B-AS
. O

Our O
wine B-AS
was O
not O
brought O
out O
until O
AFTER O
our O
entree B-AS
was O
served O
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
was O
conspicuously O
eyeing O
our O
table B-AS
the O
entire O
meal B-AS
and O
there O
was O
a O
lot O
of O
scurrying O
by O
the O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
in O
general O
. O

I O
sometimes O
go O
here O
when O
in O
the O
area O
and O
though O
the O
food B-AS
is O
always O
great O
, O
the O
Basil B-AS
Chicken I-AS
and I-AS
Shrimp I-AS
Tempura I-AS
roll I-AS
in O
particular O
, O
the O
service B-AS
has O
much O
to O
be O
desired O
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
' O
s O
recommendation O
for O
the O
entree O
( O
seabass O
in O
a O
lime B-AS
and I-AS
mango I-AS
chutney I-AS
) O
exceeded O
our O
expectations O
and O
we O
ate O
the O
chutney O
to O
the O
last O
drop O
. O

The O
fondue B-AS
was O
good O
, O
but O
not O
worth O
the O
very O
expensive O
price B-AS
tag I-AS
. O

Not O
5 O
minutes O
passed O
before O
the O
server B-AS
actually O
tapped O
us O
on O
the O
shoulder O
and O
, O
I O
swear O
to O
god O
, O
ASKED O
US O
TO O
LEAVE O
because O
they O
had O
a O
reservation B-AS
. O

For O
appetizer B-AS
I O
order O
the O
Pasteis B-AS
filled I-AS
with I-AS
Goat I-AS
cheese I-AS
Toasted I-AS
Pinenuts I-AS
. O

Everything O
I O
have O
had O
just O
tasted O
like O
salt B-AS
- I-AS
not I-AS
garlic I-AS
, O
not O
cheese B-AS
, O
salt O
- O
only O
thing O
i O
can O
figure O
is O
that O
since O
they O
churn O
it O
out O
in O
such O
quantity O
the O
quality B-AS
' O
s O
gotta O
suffer O
, O
wouldnt O
go O
back O
unless O
dragged O
or O
for O
a O
drink B-AS
. O

A O
few O
times O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
I O
felt O
as O
though O
the O
Sushi O
chef O
an O
older O
gentleman B-AS
was O
laughing O
at O
me O
and O
my O
girlfriend O
. O

The O
decor B-AS
was O
pleasant O
, O
but O
the O
tables B-AS
were O
way O
too O
much O
crowded O
for O
a O
restaurant O
of O
this O
presumptive O
caliber O
. O

Everything O
that O
could O
go O
wrong O
did O
starting O
with O
the O
set O
menu B-AS
that O
I O
was O
not O
informed O
of O
at O
the O
time O
of O
the O
reservation B-AS
, O
to O
trying O
to O
seat O
us O
45 O
minutes O
late O
at O
a O
table B-AS
that O
was O
not O
made O
up O
. O

I O
like O
pad B-AS
thai I-AS
shrimp I-AS
and I-AS
shrimp I-AS
tempura I-AS
roll I-AS
, O
for O
dessert B-AS
just O
try O
banana O
rum B-AS
. O

However O
, O
the O
drinks B-AS
are O
very O
good O
and O
this O
place O
is O
alright O
for O
brunch B-AS
, O
if O
you O
don O
' O
t O
mind O
sitting O
in O
a O
very O
cramped O
spot B-AS
and O
/ O
or O
waiting B-AS
on O
line O
. O

Our O
appetizers B-AS
came O
out O
the O
same O
time O
as O
our O
entree B-AS
and O
our O
waitress B-AS
disappeared O
quite O
frequently O
. O

this O
place B-AS
was O
ok O
I O
guess O
since O
they O
have O
karaoke O
goin B-AS
' O
on O
with O
a O
free O
shot O
if O
you O
sing O
. O

Desserts B-AS
include O
a O
sweet B-AS
masala I-AS
chai I-AS
and O
keer O
, O
and O
cardamom O
- O
and O
saffron O
- O
flavored O
rice B-AS
pudding I-AS
. O

the O
steak O
and O
chicken B-AS
fajitahs I-AS
were O
good O
, O
a O
bit O
too O
much O
sauce B-AS
on O
the O
meat B-AS
for O
my O
taste O
. O

Evidently O
, O
our O
waiter B-AS
went O
to O
the O
Mediterrean O
for O
our O
humus B-AS
pita I-AS
because O
it O
took O
about O
25 O
minutes O
. O

I O
took O
my O
boyfriend O
there O
for O
his O
birthday O
, O
he O
got O
the O
biggest O
single B-AS
serve I-AS
steak I-AS
available O
, O
we O
each O
had O
an O
appetizer B-AS
, O
i O
had O
a O
glass O
of O
wine O
and O
the O
meal O
cost O
about O
$ O
110 O
, O
which O
is O
good O
for O
a O
great O
NYC O
resturant O
. O

Let O
me O
count O
the O
problems O
: O
music B-AS
so O
loud O
it O
hurt O
, O
sticky O
unclean O
tables B-AS
, O
the O
waitress B-AS
took O
a O
long O
time O
to O
take O
our O
order O
, O
and O
then O
didn O
' O
t O
bring O
a O
glass B-AS
for O
the O
beer B-AS
. O

We O
ended O
our O
great O
experience O
by O
having O
Gulab B-AS
Jamun I-AS
( I-AS
dessert I-AS
) I-AS
recommended O
by O
the O
waiter B-AS
. O

My O
mother O
and O
I O
had O
our O
chairs B-AS
bumped O
over O
a O
dozen O
times O
by O
hasty O
waiters B-AS
. O

The O
appetizers B-AS
are O
really O
pricey O
particularly O
once O
you O
see O
the O
size B-AS
( O
or O
lack O
thereof O
) O
. O

Clever O
decor O
with O
lower O
false O
ceiling B-AS
to O
distinguish O
the O
bar B-AS
area I-AS
. O

My O
group O
and O
I O
cancelled O
whatever O
drinks B-AS
we O
ordered O
( O
no O
food O
order O
since O
there O
was O
NO O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
) O
and O
left O
. O

Guacamole B-AS
+ I-AS
shrimp I-AS
appetizer I-AS
was O
really O
great O
, O
we O
both O
had O
the O
filet O
, O
very O
good O
, O
didn O
' O
t O
much O
like O
the O
frites B-AS
that O
came O
with O
, O
but O
the O
filet O
was O
so O
good O
, O
neither O
of O
us O
cared O
. O

Finally O
, O
the O
manager B-AS
had O
the O
audacity O
to O
lock O
the O
doors B-AS
, O
presumably O
to O
prevent O
us O
from O
skipping O
out O
on O
the O
bill O
, O
while O
one O
of O
our O
friends O
went O
to O
an O
ATM O
to O
get O
cash O
. O

THe O
ribs B-AS
are O
good O
and O
I O
havent O
had O
anything O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
that O
did O
taste O
great O
. O

My O
tuna B-AS
tatare I-AS
was O
laden O
with O
salt B-AS
and O
soy O
sauce O
- O
tasted O
like O
cheap O
chinese O
instead O
of O
great O
fish O
. O

The O
pad B-AS
thai I-AS
has O
a O
nutty O
, O
mild O
flavor O
and O
can O
be O
ordered O
with O
chicken B-AS
, O
shrimp O
, O
crab O
, O
lobster B-AS
or I-AS
tofu I-AS
, O
or O
combinations O
thereof O
. O

We O
were O
on O
a O
table O
of O
6 O
, O
and O
loved O
the O
food B-AS
, O
the O
Portugues B-AS
salmon I-AS
and O
the O
sirloin O
steak O
with O
cream O
sauce O
were O
loved O
by O
everyone O
, O
the O
apetizers B-AS
were O
a O
bit O
too O
small O
for O
he O
price O
they O
charge O
. O

When O
we O
confronted O
the O
hostess B-AS
, O
she O
told O
us O
that O
there O
were O
3 O
of O
them O
and O
only O
2 O
of O
us O
, O
and O
that O
the O
3 O
women O
had O
a O
reservation B-AS
at O
8 O
: O
30pm O
. O

I O
love O
to O
go O
there O
on O
weekends O
and O
have O
the O
delicious O
french B-AS
toast I-AS
( O
made O
from O
baguette O
slices B-AS
) O
or O
the O
granola B-AS
with O
fresh O
fruit B-AS
, O
sometimes O
I O
am O
so O
torn O
that O
I O
end O
up O
getting O
both O
! O

At O
one O
point O
, O
the O
waiter B-AS
told O
us O
that O
he O
couldn O
' O
t O
find O
our O
wine B-AS
! O

( O
We O
did O
make O
reservations B-AS
, O
since O
we O
had O
a O
group O
of O
8 O
, O
but O
had O
a O
short O
wait B-AS
when O
arriving O
a O
little O
early O
. O

The O
menu B-AS
was O
small O
, O
but O
the O
food B-AS
delicious O
. O

For O
appetizers B-AS
try O
vegetable B-AS
samosas I-AS
and O
chicken B-AS
wings I-AS
. O

We O
tried O
to O
get O
the O
manager B-AS
who O
flatly O
refused O
to O
come O
to O
our O
table B-AS
and O
discuss O
the O
problem O
with O
us O
. O

The O
owner O
has O
taken O
over O
three O
dining B-AS
tables I-AS
for O
her O
computer O
, O
adding O
machine O
, O
phone O
and O
assorted O
and O
untidy O
papers B-AS
. O

Though O
the O
wait B-AS
may O
be O
long O
because O
they O
only O
have O
16 O
tables B-AS
it O
is O
worth O
it O
, O
and O
it O
seems O
to O
go O
by O
fast O
after O
a O
drink B-AS
or O
two O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
. O

The O
drinks B-AS
are O
just O
as O
expensive O
as O
the O
chain O
coffee B-AS
houses I-AS
. O

A O
waiter B-AS
looked O
me O
in O
the O
eye O
and O
said O
we O
did O
not O
order O
wine B-AS
, O
as O
if O
to O
infer O
we O
were O
making O
this O
up O
. O

We O
were O
charged O
for O
the O
missing B-AS
appetizer I-AS
and O
when O
I O
complained O
to O
the O
manager B-AS
, O
who O
never O
thought O
to O
apologize O
, O
he O
blamed O
the O
kitchen B-AS
. O

However O
, O
the O
service B-AS
has O
SIGNIFICANTLY O
declined O
since O
they O
expanded O
into O
the O
back O
room B-AS
. O

The O
pancakes B-AS
I O
ordered O
were O
nothing O
like O
the O
menu B-AS
' O
s O
description B-AS
. O

The O
place B-AS
was O
a O
bit O
busy O
when O
I O
got O
there O
so O
we O
ate O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
. O

The O
best O
dish B-AS
out O
of O
our O
3 O
mains O
: O
quail O
with O
figs O
( O
also O
had O
the O
rabbit B-AS
chicken I-AS
) O
, O
I O
suggest O
ordering O
a O
few O
plates O
to O
share O
as O
one O
would O
normally O
do O
with O
tapas B-AS
. O

Both O
times O
I O
sat O
in O
the O
lounge B-AS
area I-AS
which O
is O
very O
appealing O
, O
but O
right O
in O
front O
of O
the O
bar B-AS
, O
which O
explains O
my O
frustration O
for O
being O
ignored O
while O
dropping O
a O
lot O
of O
money O
for O
decent O
food B-AS
and O
wine O
. O

After O
ordering O
drinks O
, O
we O
both O
decided O
on O
the O
Paella B-AS
Vallenciana I-AS
, O
brought O
out O
on O
hot O
plates B-AS
. O

Very O
pleasant O
looking O
bar B-AS
area I-AS
and O
a O
lounge B-AS
area I-AS
with O
free O
pool O
. O

The O
bar B-AS
gets O
out O
of O
control O
busy O
due O
to O
it O
' O
s O
proximity O
to O
Fordham O
University O
- O
- O
but O
the O
Fordham B-AS
kids I-AS
are O
cool O
, O
so O
it O
' O
s O
alright O
! O

After O
reading O
all O
the O
reviews O
here O
and O
many O
glowing O
recommendations O
on O
food B-AS
blogs O
, O
I O
thought O
I O
MUST O
try O
this O
pizza B-AS
! O

Among O
us O
, O
we O
ordered O
a O
large O
sampling O
of O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
and O
everyone O
thoroughly O
enjoyed O
their O
meal B-AS
. O

My O
group O
got O
charged O
an O
outrageuos O
$ O
63 O
/ O
person O
for O
a O
family B-AS
- I-AS
style I-AS
dinner I-AS
, O
including O
a O
23 O
% O
tip O
added O
for O
the O
horrible O
service B-AS
. O

We O
were O
told O
by O
the O
front B-AS
door I-AS
hostess I-AS
since O
we O
didn O
' O
t O
have O
a O
reservation B-AS
, O
it O
would O
be O
about O
45mins O
for O
a O
table O
, O
but O
we O
could O
wait O
at O
the O
lounge B-AS
and O
they O
would O
get O
us O
when O
our O
table O
was O
ready O
. O

Apart O
from O
the O
rare O
to O
medium O
rare O
mistake O
on O
my O
steak B-AS
, O
the O
food B-AS
was O
ok O
and O
and O
not O
worth O
the O
money O
. O

The O
prixe O
fix O
menu B-AS
was O
a O
deal O
to O
boost O
downtown O
restaurants O
, O
atleast O
we O
didn O
' O
t O
pay O
the O
full O
price B-AS
. O

And O
the O
service B-AS
is O
unbearable O
- O
I O
waited O
for O
ages O
to O
get O
my O
drink B-AS
, O
got O
the O
wrong O
sushi O
order O
, O
and O
had O
my O
appetizer B-AS
whisked O
away O
prematurely O
. O

There O
is O
a O
huge O
line O
, O
usually O
a O
45 O
minute O
wait B-AS
; O
they O
take O
no O
reservations B-AS
and O
no O
tables B-AS
of O
more O
than O
five O
people O
. O

The O
waiters B-AS
do O
not O
pay O
any O
attention O
to O
the O
customers O
, O
instead O
sit O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
and O
watch O
TV O
. O

the O
pre B-AS
dinner I-AS
drink I-AS
at O
the O
bar B-AS
was O
very O
pleasant O
, O
good O
start O
, O
although O
we O
waited O
up O
to O
about O
an O
hour O
before O
our O
table O
was O
ready O
. O

The O
menu B-AS
is O
pricey O
and O
the O
food O
was O
not O
tasty O
- O
except O
for O
the O
tostones B-AS
with O
garlic B-AS
and O
oil B-AS
. O

My O
boyfriend O
took O
me O
to O
dinner O
for O
an O
early O
Valentine O
' O
s O
Day O
, O
we O
showed O
up O
early O
for O
our O
reservation B-AS
to O
meet O
an O
incredibly O
rude O
host O
who O
told O
us O
the O
bar B-AS
was O
full O
, O
to O
just O
wait O
behind O
a O
rope O
. O

for O
dessert B-AS
, O
you O
can O
' O
t O
go O
wrong O
with O
the O
buttermilk O
panacotta O
with O
rhubarb O
compote O
, O
or O
the O
righteous O
cheesecake B-AS
. O

Ok O
, O
it O
' O
s O
not O
greasy O
steak O
and O
juicy O
burger O
good O
, O
but O
it O
' O
s O
a O
light O
healthy O
fare B-AS
, O
if O
you O
are O
into O
that O
kind O
of O
stuff B-AS
. O

When O
there O
are O
ten O
open O
tables O
in O
a O
room O
, O
the O
hostess B-AS
insisted O
on O
seating B-AS
peopl O
on O
top O
of O
each O
other O
. O

For O
the O
prices B-AS
, O
the O
food B-AS
is O
decidedly O
lackluster O
, O
and O
the O
service B-AS
, O
unless O
you O
are O
a O
regular O
, O
can O
be O
quite O
rude O
. O

We O
happen O
to O
walk O
by O
, O
read O
the O
menu B-AS
posted O
outside O
they O
offered O
a O
nice O
selection B-AS
ranging O
from O
citrus O
salmon B-AS
, O
pan B-AS
seared O
trout O

out O
of O
this O

ingredient O

The O

has O
a O
great O
atmosphere B-AS
amd O
amazing O
staff B-AS
who O
are O
always O
there O
to O
help O
if O
its O
a O
cup B-AS
of I-AS
coffee I-AS
or O
a O
nice O
chat O
. O

They O
did O
a O
great O
job O
on O
the O
decor B-AS
but O
it O
seems O
that O
the O
food B-AS
has O
gotten O
a O
bit O
less O
in O
the O
quality O
department O
, O
as O
well O
as O
in O
the O
portion B-AS
size I-AS
! O

I O
had O
dinner B-AS
with O
my O
friend O
, O
and O
regardless O
of O
our O
$ O
100 O
check O
, O
I O
overheard O
the O
waiter B-AS
say O
that O
we O
had O
been O
there O
too O
long O
. O

The O
prices O
have O
gone O
up O
and O
some O
of O
good O
old O
standby O
entrees B-AS
have O
disappeared O
from O
the O
menu B-AS
. O

The O
Food B-AS
Crispy O

and O
excellent O
olive B-AS

start O
the O

, O
but O

Sacramone O
' O
s O
abbondanza O
means O
you O
' O
ll O
be O
going O
home O
with O
doggie O
bags O
. O

We O
asked O
the O
waitress B-AS
very O
nicely O
to O
please O
change O
the O
playlist O
to O
something O
more O
appropriate O
for O
dinner B-AS
, O
she O
chuckled O
to O
herself O
and O
said O
sure O
but O
never O
changed O
it O
. O

We O
went O
for O
lunch B-AS
on O
Saturday O
, O
wait B-AS
wasn O
' O
t O
bad O
considering O
that O
it O
had O
only O
opened O
recently O
. O

The O
complimentary O
desssert B-AS
with O
the O
Greek B-AS
coffee I-AS
knocked O
my O
socks O
off O
! O

I O
stopped O
in O
here O
for O
a O
pre B-AS
- I-AS
theater I-AS
dinner I-AS
, O
and O
I O
must O
say O
I O
was O
very O
happy O
with O
my O
meal B-AS
. O

People O
were O
leaving O
because O
they O
had O
been O
waiting B-AS
for O
hours O
, O
however O
we O
decided O
to O
stay O
and O
have O
a O
complimentary O
drink O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
which O
was O
absoloutely O
beautiful O
along O
with O
the O
view O
, O
the O
only O
plus O
. O

As O
the O
waitress B-AS
cleaned O
the O
table B-AS
in O
a O
rush O
she O
knocked O
over O
a O
party O
bag O
containing O
a O
glass B-AS
bottle I-AS
with O
bath O
oil O
. O

Between O
the O
6 O
of O
us O
we O
tried O
almost O
everything O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
and O
we O
were O
all O
very O
pleased O
with O
our O
meals B-AS
. O

Since O
the O
menu B-AS
is O
not O
organized O
in O
the O
way O
to O
describe O
the O
size O
of O
each O
dish O
, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
omakase O
nor O
a O
course O
, O
waiter B-AS
' O
s O
recommendation O
may O
be O
crucial O
to O
decide O
what O
to O
order O
, O
but O
he O
just O
recommended O
what O
he O
likes O
without O
considering O
appropriate O
amount O
for O
one O
person O
, O
and O
even O
served O
shellfish O
to O
whom O
who O
had O
mentioned O
she O
is O
allergic O
to O
shellfish O
! O

Even O
though O
it O
wasn O
' O
t O
totally O
full O
, O
the O
waitress B-AS
had O
to O
RUN O
around O
the O
restaurant O
, O
and O
the O
drinks B-AS
and O
the O
food O
took O
a O
LONG O
time O
to O
arrive O
. O

Showed O
up O
last O
Sunday O
night O
with O
girlfriends O
and O
no O
reservation O
, O
host B-AS
was O
very O
helpful O
finding O
us O
a O
seats O
at O
bar B-AS
after O
short O
wait B-AS
. O

As O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
everyone O
else O
' O
s O
sushi B-AS
looked O
better O
: O
the O
waitresses B-AS
are O
not O
responsible O
for O
offering O
you O
what O
is O
CLEARLY O
written O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
as O
Omakase O
- O
Chef O
' O
s O
Choice O
. O

The O
only O
bad O
thing O
was O
that O
the O
third O
alien B-AS
was O
so O
friendly O
and O
took O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
at O
the O
other O
tables B-AS
, O
so O
she O
didn O
' O
t O
come O
see O
us O
. O

We O
received O
our O
food B-AS
and O
coffee B-AS
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
and O
couldn O
' O
t O
get O
the O
attention O
of O
any O
waiter B-AS
to O
refill O
our O
cups O
. O

i O
love O
this O
pizza B-AS
, O
its O
not O
greasy O
or O
filled O
with O
mounds B-AS
of O
cheese O
, O
its O
just O
fresh O
tomatoes B-AS
basil I-AS
and O
buffalo O
mozz O
. O

We O
tried O
explaining O
nicely O
to O
them O
that O
we O
were O
just O
finishing O
up O
a O
drink B-AS
, O
and O
after O
a O
brief O
, O
unprofessional O
discussion O
with O
the O
two O
waiters B-AS
, O
they O
told O
us O
never O
to O
come O
back O
again O
. O

my O
date O
' O
s O
non O
veg O
thali B-AS
was O
really O
expensive O
and O
had O
like O
one O
or O
two O
pieces O
of O
meat B-AS
in O
each O
sauce B-AS
. O

We O
fully O
relied O
on O
our O
very O
capable O
waiter B-AS
for O
choices O
of O
the O
menu B-AS
and O
we O
were O
not O
disappointed O
. O

There O
were O
many O
helpful O
people O
, O
not O
only O
one O
waiter B-AS
- O
kept O
refilling O
the O
water O
, O
the O
wine B-AS
, O
asking O
if O
everything O
was O
okay O
. O

Also O
lovely O
was O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
; O
the O
high O
ceilings O
and O
spacious O
room O
make O
it O
a O
nice O
contrast O
from O
the O
other O
brunch B-AS
mills O
on O
the O
upper O
west O
side O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
so O
- O
so O
and O
you O
would O
think O
it O
was O
a O
french O
resturant O
, O
the O
portions B-AS
were O
so O
tiny O
. O

For O
lunch B-AS
I O
had O
the O
Carnitas B-AS
de I-AS
Puercos I-AS
( I-AS
pork I-AS
tacos I-AS
) I-AS
, O
which O
was O
a O
bit O
bland O
and O
the O
portions B-AS
are O
kind O
of O
small O
dont O
expect O
to O
chow O
down O
. O

) O
, O
we O
were O
not O
given O
bread B-AS
though O
the O
couple O
next O
to O
us O
was O
, O
we O
asked O
twice O
for O
our O
check O
and O
when O
it O
came O
, O
they O
forced O
us O
to O
pay O
the O
tip B-AS
in O
cash O
so O
they O
could O
get O
out O
of O
paying O
taxes O
! O

At O
one O
point O
I O
noticed O
the O
grime O
on O
the O
mustard O
bottle B-AS
and O
asked O
the O
waitress B-AS
for O
a O
clean O
one O
. O

if O
you O
don O
' O
t O
mind O
slow O
service B-AS
and O
limited O
selections O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
occasionally O
, O
then O
you O
might O
consider O
dining O
there O
. O

the O
regular O
prices B-AS
looked O
pretty O
expensive O
( O
~ O
$ O
15 O
per O
appetizer B-AS
, O
~ O
$ O
35 O
per O
entre O
) O
so O
the O
restaurant O
week O
menu O
( O
at O
$ O
35pp O
) O
seemed O
like O
a O
sweet O
deal O
. O

Best O
Baked B-AS
Ziti I-AS
in O
the O
area B-AS
, O
great O
classic O
NY B-AS
pizza I-AS
. O

The O
service B-AS
may O
be O
a O
little O
slow O
( O
what O
can O
you O
expect O
in O
this O
laid O
back O
atmosphere O
) O
, O
but O
a O
Sunday O
brunch B-AS
is O
a O
rewarding O
experience O
. O

Husband O
and O
Wife O
owners B-AS
are O
always O
pleasent O
and O
accomidating O
, O
food B-AS
is O
top O
notch O
quality O
made O
with O
care O
, O
and O
now O
, O
recently O
renovated O
to O
accomidate O
more O
tables B-AS
and O
a O
young O
fresh O
feel O
. O

Even O
with O
reservations B-AS
, O
checking O
in O
, O
and O
a O
generally O
quiet O
night O
, O
the O
hostess B-AS
forgot O
that O
we O
were O
there O
and O
gave O
our O
table O
to O
her O
friends O
. O

After O
having O
the O
table B-AS
cleared O
and O
recieving O
fresh O
warm O
plates B-AS
, O
we O
shared O
the O
Chicken B-AS
Tikka I-AS
Masala I-AS
and O
the O
Chicken O
and O
Lentils B-AS
. O

The O
tasting O
menu B-AS
experience O
lasted O
close O
to O
three O
hours O
and O
included O
six O
or O
seven O
food B-AS
courses I-AS
and O
three O
desert O
courses O
. O

Stumbled O
unto O
this O
little O
gem O
early O
one O
saturday O
afternoon B-AS
and O
was O
thoroughly O
pleased O
with O
the O
wonderful O
little O
backyard B-AS
. O

South O
American O
additions O
to O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
like O
perfectly O
fried B-AS
green I-AS
plantains I-AS
and O
garlicky O
pork B-AS
, O
are O
uniformly O
successful O
. O

The O
Food B-AS
The O
fare B-AS
is O
mostly O
traditional O
, O
with O
a O
few O
contemporary O
specials B-AS
offered O
nightly O
. O

A O
typical O
old O
New O
York O
steak O
- O
house O
atmosphere B-AS
- O
no O
ambience B-AS
, O
comfort B-AS
or O
class O
, O
but O
some O
of O
the O
best O
steak O
you O
will O
ever O
have O
. O

Great O
romantic O
place B-AS
for O
a O
date O
( O
try O
to O
get O
the O
corner B-AS
booth I-AS
table I-AS
for O
a O
little O
privacy B-AS
and O
to O
sit O
close O
! O

We O
were O
served O
by O
two O
very O
rude O
waitresses B-AS
who O
slammed O
every O
glass O
and O
dish B-AS
they O
brought O
onto O
the O
table B-AS
, O
and O
then O
got O
so O
caught O
up O
by O
hanging O
out O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
that O
I O
eventually O
had O
to O
hunt O
them O
down O
to O
pay O
my O
bill O
. O

A O
freind O
invited O
me O
for O
lunch B-AS
at O
Home O
because O
he O
said O
they O
have O
the O
best O
hamburgers B-AS
. O

It O
is O
not O
a O
very O
stylish O
place B-AS
, O
but O
we O
had O
some O
of O
the O
best O
Chinese B-AS
food I-AS
we O
ever O
had O
. O

The O
ingredients B-AS
are O
fabulously O
fresh O
and O
the O
pizza B-AS
' O
s O
well O
- O
prepared O
- O
- O
but O
the O
crust B-AS
doesn O
' O
t O
match O
up O
to O
John O
' O
s O
. O

In O
the O
front O
bar B-AS
, O
boisterous O
neighbors O
and O
friends O
share O
bottles O
of O
wine B-AS
; O
the O
large O
dining O
room O
, O
with O
its O
lovely O
painted B-AS
ceiling I-AS
and O
oversized O
portrait O
of O
a O
portly O
chef B-AS
, O
is O
the O
destination O
for O
serious O
eating O
. O

After O
each O
of O
them O
had O
had O
one O
drink B-AS
, O
one O
of O
the O
managers B-AS
came O
up O
to O
our O
table O
and O
told O
us O
that O
he O
no O
longer O
felt O
comfortable O
serving O
us O
any O
more O
margaritas O
. O

The O
Food B-AS
There O
' O
s O
something O
for O
fish O
fans O
of O
every O
stripe O
on O
the O
lengthy O
menu B-AS
. O

Ask O
for O
the O
cocktail B-AS
menu I-AS
it O
has O
a O
plenty O
selection O
of O
drinks B-AS
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
very O
good O
, O
although O
the O
food B-AS
was O
mediocre O
. O

Had O
dinner B-AS
here O
this O
past O
Friday O
night O
with O
some O
friends O
and O
Salmon B-AS
River O
definitely O
did O
not O
disappointment O
. O

People O
at O
the O
next O
table B-AS
were O
complaining O
how O
horrible O
their O
house O
wine B-AS
was O
. O

Even O
though O
the O
food B-AS
was O
prepared O
nicely O
, O
it O
was O
definitely O
lacking O
flavor B-AS
. O

However O
, O
we O
were O
never O
served B-AS
bread I-AS
with O
our O
meals B-AS
and O
the O
restaurant O
is O
too O
crowded O
. O

Yes O
, O
hard O
not O
to O
look O
at O
the O
waitresses O
( O
and O
they O
' O
re O
really O
good O
servers B-AS
) O
, O
but O
as O
I O
' O
m O
reminded O
by O
everyone O
who O
knows O
Hooters O
, O
they O
don O
' O
t O
rank O
anywhere O
near O
the O
girls O
at O
the O
Hooters O
locations O
South O
of O
the O
ol O
' O
Mason B-AS
- I-AS
Dixon I-AS
. O

Cute O
decor B-AS
, O
but O
rather O
small O
so O
the O
dining B-AS
room I-AS
can O
get O
very O
smoky O
if O
the O
bar O
is O
crowded O
. O

Customers O
choose O
flavors O
like O
sweet B-AS
cream I-AS
, O
cake B-AS
batter I-AS
or O
banana B-AS
, O
add O
mix O

from O

bar B-AS
chunks O
and O
Gummi O
bears O
to O
hot O

and O

butter O
- O
- O
then O
servers B-AS
mash O
it O
all O
together O
on O
a O
frozen O
slab O
of O

Knock O
off O
15 O

20 O
% O
of O
the O
prices B-AS
and O
you O
have O
a O
decent O
night O
out B-AS

( O
must O
try O
the O
fois B-AS
gras I-AS
appetizer I-AS
and O
chocolate B-AS
milkshake I-AS
for O
dessert B-AS
. O

I O
am O
an O
extremely O
low O
maintenance O
diner B-AS
and O
the O
staff O
at O
this O
restaurant O
managed O
to O
insult O
my O
dinner B-AS
party O
and O
refuse O
kitchen O
service O
minutes O
after O
seating B-AS
us O
and O
informing O
us O
that O
the O
kitchen O
was O
open O
. O

Overall O
, O
I O
good O
place B-AS
to O
take O
a O
date O
or O
have O
a O
small O
group O
of O
friends O
for O
dinner B-AS

We O
were O
seated B-AS
promptly O
there O
were O
a O
few O
people O
waiting B-AS
in O
the O
bar B-AS
, O
but O
had O
ordered O
quickly O
been O
at O
the O
table O
less O
than O
45 O
mins O
. O

' O
When O
I O
reasoned O
with O
them O
that O
my O
dining B-AS
partner O
already O
received O
her O
hot O
entree B-AS
and O
was O
halfway O
done O
eating O
, O
and O
all O
I O
ordered O
was O
two O
rolls O
, O
the O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
finally O
got O
the O
idea O
that O
maybe O
they O
should O
be O
trying O
to O
get O
me O
my O
order O
. O

The O
salad B-AS
looked O
as O
though O
they O
have O
a O
premixed B-AS
trash O
bag O
full O
of O
it O
, O
and O
they O
just O
dump O
a O
heap O
of O
it O
on O
a O
plate O

The O

me O
on O

vacation O

and O
although O
there O
was O
a O
bit O
of O
a O
wait B-AS
for O
a O
table O
, O
the O
food B-AS
was O
well O
worth O
it O
. O

Don O

forget O
to O
get O
quacamole O
made O
at O
your O
table O
( O

I O
told O
the O
waitress B-AS
it O
was O
my O
cousin O

birthday O
and O
they O
brought O
out O
a O
cake O
and O
the O
mariachi O

played O
at O
our O
table O

The O
other O
dish B-AS
was O
arroz O

the O
chicken B-AS
was O
delicions O
and O
the O
rice B-AS
was O
a O
greasy O

good O
. O

I O
met O
five O
of O
my O
friends O
for O
dinner B-AS
at O

Get O
the O
pepperoni B-AS

YUM O

and O
a O
family B-AS
style I-AS
salad I-AS

We O
had O
a O
very O
nice O
and O
entertaining O
waitress B-AS
who O
was O
very O
much O
on O
top O
of O
our O
table B-AS
. O

Lousy O
, O
hard O
as O
a O
rock B-AS
home O
made O
potato O
chips O
that O
could O
slice O
a O
tomato O
as O
well O
as O
a O
soda B-AS
can I-AS
. O

) O
, O
the O
BBQ B-AS
salmon I-AS
was O
good O
if O
not O
a O
bit O
too O
salty O
from O
the O
heavy O
miso B-AS
. O

Along O
with O
the O
regular B-AS
items I-AS
on O
the O
menus O
, O
they O
also O
offer O
some O
wonderful O
specials B-AS
- O
- O
and O
if O
an O
item O
is O
not O
on O
a O
menu O
, O
they O
always O
do O
their O
best O
to O
accommodate O
. O

Two O
curiosities O
: O
on O
my O
last O
two O
visits O
, O
the O
salad B-AS
' I-AS
s I-AS
lettuce I-AS
had O
clearly O
seen O
better O
days O
, O
and O
on O
my O
last O
visit O
, O
I O
was O
told O
that O
I O
couldn O
' O
t O
have O
coffee B-AS
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
meal O
( O
we O
were O
asked O
to O
go O
next O
door O
! O
) O

They O
might O
be O
all O
business O
at O
the O
counter B-AS
when O
you O
give O
your O
order O
, O
but O
their O
food B-AS
says O
I O
love O
you O
. O

was O
yelling O
at O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
waitstaff B-AS
audibly O
enough O
that O
I O
was O
able O
to O
follow O
his O
entire O
tirade O
from O
where O
I O
sat O
in O
the O
secondary O
dining B-AS
room I-AS
. O

Went O
here O
for O
a O
casual O
Sunday B-AS
night O
dinner O
at O
7 O
: O
45pm O
; O
dinner O
was O
served B-AS
at O
10 O
: O
15pm O
! O

I O
ordered O
a O
thin B-AS
- I-AS
crust I-AS
individual I-AS
meat I-AS
pizza I-AS
which O
was O
big O
enough O
for O
two O
and O
my O
companion O
ordered O
pasta B-AS
with I-AS
pesto I-AS
. O

For O
fun O
on O
the O
run O
, O
sip O
a O
mojito B-AS
at O
the O
bar B-AS
while O
a O
portrait O
of O
the O
Virgin O
Mary O
bizarrely O
watches O
over O
you O
. O

The O
red B-AS
sauce I-AS
had O
no O
flavor B-AS
, O
the O
cheese O
lacked O
that O
fresh O
quality O
cheese O
taste O
you O
expect O
from O
a O
well O
- O
known O
pizzaria O
, O
and O
the O
slice O
overall O
was O
really O
dry O
. O

Although O
the O
food B-AS
was O
in O
small O
portions B-AS
, O
it O
was O
good O
. O

They O
need O
to O
change O
the O
overall O
decor B-AS
if O
they O
want O
to O
get O
a O
serious O
dinner B-AS
crowd O
though O
. O

On O
the O
menu B-AS
board O
posted O
outside O
- O
they O
got O
Passion O
Fruit B-AS
Creme I-AS
Brule I-AS
. O

If O
you O
live O
downtown O
, O
definitely O
grab O
one O
of O
their O
menus B-AS
, O
make O
a O
phone O
call O
and O
relax O
in O
front O
of O
the O
tv O
while O
they O
pound O
the O
pavement O
to O
get O
to O
you O
( O
although O
they O
do O
take O
about O
45 O
minutes O
on O
average O
to O
get O
to O
you O
) O
- O
- O
the O
in O
restaurant O
service B-AS
is O
likewise O
very O
very O
good O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
slow O
and O
spotty O
; O
had O
to O
flag O
the O
waiter B-AS
down O
many O
a O
time O
to O
get O
drink B-AS
and O
food O
orders O
in O
. O

If O
you O
want O
a O
quiet O
dinner B-AS
don O
' O
t O
show O
up O
late O
, O
cuz O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
gets O
louder O
and O
more O
loungy O
as O
the O
nite O
goes O
on O
. O

I O
had O
the O
lobster B-AS
ravioli I-AS
- O
- O
good O
size O
portion O
with O
a O
delicious O
vodka B-AS
cream I-AS
sauce I-AS
. O

the O
waitress B-AS
never O
asked O
us O
how O
the O
food B-AS
was O
or O
if O
we O
needed O
anything O
. O

The O
food B-AS
, O
however O
, O
is O
completely O
uninteresting O
- O
my O
special O
of O
the O
day B-AS
pasta I-AS
was O
decent O
, O
but O
definitely O
not O
worth O
the O
money O
, O
the O
wine B-AS
wasn O
' O
t O
particularly O
spectacular O
, O
and O
the O
bread B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
OK O
at O
best O
, O
and O
if O
you O
don O
' O
t O
LOVE O
cheese B-AS
don O
' O
t O
even O
consider O
going O
here O
. O

Sit O
at O
the O
bar O
( O
no O
reservations B-AS
necessary O
) O
, O
eat O
, O
talk O
to O
the O
bartender O
, O
and O
enjoy O
, O
b O
/ O
c O
come O
dinnertime O
you O
will O
pay O
quadruple O
the O
price B-AS
( O
but O
it O
' O
s O
still O
worth O
it O
) O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
had O
Gnocchi B-AS
from O
the O
Bronx O
to O
Coney O
Island O
and O
this O
place B-AS
is O
, O
hands O
down O
, O
the O
best O
. O

Did O
not O
get O
to O
dessert B-AS
as O
it O
took O
a O
while O
to O
get O
the O
server B-AS
' O
s O
attention O
and O
we O
had O
a O
show O
to O
get O
to O
. O

To O
the O
amusement O
of O
our O
server B-AS
, O
I O
wrote O
everything O
down O
, O
lest O
I O
forget O
a O
single O
morsel O
( O
about O
21 O
different O
dishes B-AS
) O
. O

Man O
, O
that O
chicken B-AS
( O
in O
some O
kind O
of O
spicy B-AS
soup I-AS
) O
was O
yummy O
! O

Besides O
ordering O
single B-AS
dishes I-AS
you O
can O
also O
order O
family O
style B-AS
. O

The O
owners B-AS
couldn O
' O
t O
have O
been O
more O
accomodating O
- O
- O
we O
had O
the O
entire O
restaurant O
to O
ourselves O
on O
a O
Saturday O
( O
before O
it O
opens O
to O
the O
public O
for O
dinner B-AS
) O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
autrocious O
in O
fact O
my O
order O
came O
out O
wrong O
and O
our O
wine B-AS
was O
never O
repoured O
throughout O
the O
entire O
dinner B-AS
, O
which O
lasted O
3 O
hours O
. O

Place B-AS
was O
okay O
, O
the O
food B-AS
was O
definitely O
not O
worth O
the O
money O
, O
however O
the O
appetizers B-AS
were O
good O
, O
we O
had O
the O
jumbo O
shrimp B-AS
and O
oysters B-AS
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
a O
bit O
inadequate O
- O
and O
be O
warned O
they O
bring O
your O
food B-AS
as O
it O
is O
ready O
- O
so O
be O
sure O
to O
order O
apps O
then O
after O
being O
served O
order O
entrees B-AS
. O

Ten O
minutes O
later O
: O
no O
burgers B-AS
and O
no O
sign O
of O
our O
waiter B-AS
. O

For O
the O
high O
price B-AS
you O
would O
pay O
( O
dinner B-AS
for O
the O
two O
could O
run O
$ O
80 O
) O
, O
you O
sure O
do O
get O
alot O
. O

While O
I O
liked O
the O
place B-AS
, O
I O
' O
d O
never O
come O
back O
in O
a O
weekend O
night O
again O
, O
and O
with O
reservations B-AS
. O

Then O
the O
food B-AS
came O
- O
TINY O
portions B-AS
and O
plates B-AS
came O
out O
in O
15 O
min O
intervals O
. O

We O
both O
had O
habtchi O
, O
a O
bottle B-AS
of I-AS
plum I-AS
wine I-AS
, O
and O
3 O
appetizer O
, O
the O
food B-AS
was O
great O
, O
and O
I O
really O
didnt O
find O
the O
wait O
to O
be O
that O
long O
like O
some O
the O
other O
review O
said O
. O

the O
pasta B-AS
I O
had O
for O
lunch B-AS
was O
$ O
12 O
, O
but O
my O
dessert O
, O
which O
was O
a O
small O
slice O
of O
apple B-AS
pie I-AS
, O
was O
$ O
10 O
! O

The O
jukebox B-AS
is O
always O
playing O
good O
tunes O
, O
and O
the O
patrons B-AS
are O
never O
shy O
about O
getting O
up O
and O
dancing O
in O
the O
aisles O
, O
or O
even O
on O
the O
bar B-AS
. O

( O
So O
long O
that O
it O
prevented O
me O
from O
increasing O
their O
sales B-AS
by O
getting O
more O
possible O
drinks B-AS
) O
If O
i O
just O
saw O
my O
one O
waiter B-AS
the O
whole O
night O
I O
would O
have O
known O
who O
to O
talk O
too O
. O

I O
liked O
the O
beer B-AS
selection I-AS
! O

Your O
drink B-AS
is O
at O
your O
fingertips O
and O
you O
don O
' O
t O
have O
to O
wait O
for O
the O
waitress B-AS
to O
come O
back O
with O
your O
cocktail B-AS
. O

We O
were O
seated O
promptly O
for O
a O
Saturday B-AS
lunch I-AS
, O
but O
service B-AS
was O
incredibly O
slow O
. O

They O
don O
' O
t O
load O
their O
pizza O
down O
with O
tons O
of O
cheese B-AS
nor O
is O
it O
dripping O
with O
sauce B-AS
. O

I O
had O
to O
stare O
out O
waitress B-AS
down O
to O
get O
our O
check B-AS
and O
also O
we O
were O
charge O
. O

The O
hostess B-AS
did O
offer O
free O
drinks B-AS
to O
my O
party O
due O
to O
the O
wait O
, O
but O
we O
were O
more O
interested O
in O
eating O
after O
said O
long O
wait O
. O

Sure O
, O
the O
hostess B-AS
can O
be O
rude O
, O
but O
when O
in O
the O
mood O
for O
authentic O
Mexican B-AS
food I-AS
, O
there O
is O
no O
better O
place O
in O
NYC O
, O
yet O
. O

Servers B-AS
are O
layed O
back O
, O
but O
food B-AS
arrives O
rapidly O
. O

We O
had O
a O
few O
toro O
and O
white O
tuna O
sashimi O
as O
well O
as O
a O
couple O
roll O
like O
the O
park O

( O
which O
was O
not O
listed O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
but O
recommended O
by O
the O

and O

The O
food B-AS
and O
the O

been O

on O
our O

and O
then O
after O
only O
a O
little O
more O
than O
an O
hour O
, O
the O
check O
was O
slipped O
onto O
the O
table B-AS
for O
our O
large O
party O
, O
and O
a O
few O
minutes O
later O
, O
waiters B-AS
began O
yelling O
at O
us O
to O
leave O
. O

No O
table B-AS
space I-AS
and O
one O
of O
the O
angry O
neighbors O
decided O
to O
take O
matters O
into O
his O

hands O
by O
throwing O
a O
bucket O
of O
water B-AS
out O
his O
window O
and O
onto O
the O
patrons B-AS
waiting I-AS
for O
their O
tables O

But O
other O
comfort O
foods B-AS
are O
also O
superb O
: O
Scallion B-AS
pancakes I-AS

delectably O

The O

HOT B-AS
DOGS I-AS
, O
that O
' O

Heartland O
is O
the O
best O
place O
in O
mid O
- O
town O
to O
grab O
a O
beer B-AS
after O
work O
and O
meet O
the O
cuties B-AS
that O
work O
in O
the O
building O
. O

My O
date O
and O
I O
had O
entrees B-AS

soup B-AS
, O
and B-AS
appetizers I-AS
( O
fresh B-AS
spinach I-AS
pierogies I-AS
) O
for O
$ O
33 O
- O
( O
$ O
40 O
with O
the O
tip O
) O
. O

The O
pizza B-AS
is O
baked O
in O
a O
wood O
burning O
oven O
and O
the O
flavor B-AS
is O
fantastic O
. O

Noodle O
bowls O
are O
mixed O
with O
tempura O
vegetables O
, O
mountain O
yam O
, O
mushrooms B-AS
, O
or O
spiced O
with O
curry O
or O
cold O
citrus B-AS
dipping I-AS
sauces I-AS
. O

Upon O
walking O
in O
and O
noticing O
the O
exposed O
red O
brick O
wall O
and O
the O
white B-AS
tableclothes I-AS
and O
and O
huge O
rack B-AS
of O
various O
wines B-AS
behind O
the O
bar O
, O
I O
felt O
like O
I O
was O
in O
a O
truly O
authentic O
Italian O
restaurant O
. O

They O
serve O
food B-AS
with O
an O
entire O
loaf O
of O
freshly O
- O
baked O
bread B-AS
, O
crusty O
on O
the O
outside O
and O
unbelievably O
warm O
and O
gooey O
in O
the O
center O
. O

I O
love O
the O
steak B-AS
and O
eggs B-AS
with O
a O
bloody O
mary O
that O
costs O
around O
$ O
7 O
bucks O
. O

I O
found O
my O
dinner B-AS
to O
be O
a O
bit O
on O
the O
heavy O
side O
and O
blamed O
the O
large O
portions B-AS
. O

The O
entree B-AS
- O
- O
a O
decent O
filet B-AS
mignon I-AS
, O
soupy O
mashed O
potatoes O
, O
and O
, O
believe O
it O
or O
not O
, O
frozen O
mixed B-AS
veggies I-AS
! O

i O
thought O
the O
food B-AS
was O
great O
but O
kind O
of O
expensive O
for O
that O
atmosphere B-AS
, O
the O
tables B-AS
were O
too O
close O
and O
it O
was O
too O
noisy O
. O

Two O
dogs B-AS
and O
an O
adequately O
sized O
drink B-AS
for O
two O
dollars O
. O

The O
snooty O
manager B-AS
asked O
us O
to O
leave O
and O
gave O
us O
our O
check O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
our O
meal B-AS
. O

The O
menu B-AS
options I-AS
were O
not O
appealing O
, O
we O
had O
to O
beg O
the O
waiter B-AS
to O
ask O
the O
chef B-AS
if O
we O
could O
have O
just O
a O
plain B-AS
dinner I-AS
salad I-AS
to O
start O
as O
their O
salad B-AS
choices I-AS
were O
not O
appetizing O
. O

The O
menu B-AS
was O
much O
too O
narrow O
- O
4 O
pastas O
and O
6 O
meat B-AS
dishes I-AS
or O
so O
. O

I O
still O
go O
often O
, O
but O
the O
prices B-AS
went O
up O
a O
little O
and O
the O
service O
is O
even O
slower O
now O
that O
they O
' O
re O
always O
full O
during O
dinner B-AS
hours O
. O

The O
music B-AS
is O
a O
mix O
of O
house O
radio O
as O
well O
as O
live O
band B-AS
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

Great O
when O
the O
band B-AS
is O
playing O
, O
not O
so O
great O
when O
there O
' O
s O
a O
large O
party O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
. O

We O
were O
seated O
promptly O
and O
brought O
rolls O
and O
water B-AS
but O
then O
were O
made O
to O
wait O
much O
too O
long O
before O
our O
beverage O
order O
was O
taken O
and O
then O
much O
much O
too O
long O
before O
our O
waiter B-AS
came O
back O
for O
a O
food B-AS
order O
. O

While O
service B-AS
is O
still O
ok O
, O
the O
food B-AS
has O
been O
not O
up O
to O
par O
on O
my O
last O
few O
visits O
. O

Suddenly O
the O
manager B-AS
, O
came O
to O
our O
table O
yelling O
absolutely O
no O
way O
we O
can O
have O
a O
drink B-AS
after I-AS
dinner I-AS
becuase O
he O
has O
tables O
waiting O
Just O
to O
be O
clear O
we O
spent O
over O
$ O
70 O
and O
had O
1 O
drink O
each O
, O
we O
used O
the O
table O
for O
about O
1hour O
and O
15 O
minutes O
. O

We O
ate O
at O
the O
bar O
to O
avoid O
waiting B-AS
for O
a O
table B-AS
. O

the O
food B-AS
at O
pongal O
is O
average O
, O
the O
rava B-AS
masala I-AS
dosa I-AS
is O
much O
better O
at O
madras O
mahal O
( O
a O
few O
doors O
down O
) O
and O
certainly O
the O
service B-AS
at O
pongal O
is O
the O
worst O
among O
the O
indian O
restaurants O
along O
that O
block O
. O

I O
am O
hoping O
the O
stale O
service B-AS
was O
a O
one O
shot O
deal O
because O
it O
was O
deplorable O
for O
what O
we O
paid O
for O
dinner B-AS
! O

The O
mussels B-AS
and O
frits O
were O
great O
, O
but O
the O
host B-AS
had O
an O
attitude O
and O
my O
friends O
and O
I O
waited O
about O
1 O
1 O
/ O
2 O
hours O
to O
be O
seated O
on O
a O
random O
Tues O
. O

My O
hubby O
' O
s O
a O
very O
picky O
eater O
, O
( O
plain O
, O
no O
condiments B-AS
, O
no O
cheese O
, O
just O
salt O
pepper O
, O
and O
onions B-AS
) O
and O
as O
busy O
as O
they O
were O
, O
they O
got O
it O
RIGHT O
THE O
FIRST O
TIME O
! O
! O

The O
waiter B-AS
nearly O
yelled O
at O
me O
when O
I O
asked O
for O
more O
water B-AS
. O

Room B-AS
is O
impressive O
, O
but O
service B-AS
is O
slow O
and O
taste O
was O
almost O
like O
fast O
food B-AS
. O

Appetizers B-AS
and O
drinks B-AS
came O
on O
time O
, O
but O
we O
waited O
40 O
/ O
45 O
minutes O
for O
entrees B-AS
. O

The O
sauce B-AS
has O
a O
lemony O
olivey O
taste O
and O
the O
crust B-AS
has O
the O
right O
mix B-AS
of O
chewey O
and O
crunchy O
textures B-AS
. O

They O
were O
out O
of O
cherry O
, O
so O
we O
got O
a O
few O
slices B-AS
of O
apple B-AS
and O
one O
key O
lime O
. O

The O
menu O
, O
which O
combines O
pan O
- O
Asian O
influences O
, O
offers O
a O
wide O
range B-AS
of O
stir B-AS
- I-AS
fries I-AS
and O
noodle B-AS
dishes I-AS
, O
with O
several O
varieties O
of O
momo O
( O
Tibetan B-AS
dumplings I-AS
) O
as O
highlights O
. O

The O
smell O
was O
heavenly O
, O
and O
the O
appearance B-AS
was O
great O
, O
but O
the O
cheese B-AS
was O
a O
little O
too O
salty O
and O
heavy O
. O

But O
the O
service B-AS
was O
absolutely O
terrible O
, O
and O
we O
watied O
45 O
minutes O
for O
food B-AS
. O

When O
we O
finally O
had O
to O
see O
the O
manager B-AS
because O
I O
had O
lemon O
juice O
spilled O
on O
me O
from O
the O
waiter O
- O
she O
even O
took O
over O
10 O
minutes O
to O
come O
to O
the O
table B-AS
. O

Our O
apetizers B-AS
took O
quite O
a O
while O
to O
be O
served O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
while O
all O
the O
other O
tables B-AS
that O
sat O
way O
after O
us O
were O
being O
served O
I O
asked O
the O
waiter B-AS
what O
happened O
to O
our O
appetizers B-AS
, O
the O
calamari B-AS
was O
tough O
; O
The O
entrees O
were O
tasteless O
and O
really O
! O
, O
one O
have O
to O
be O
really O
bad O
to O
mess O
a O
simple O
pasta B-AS
dish I-AS
. O

a O
drink B-AS
or O
two O
went O
by O
, O
but O
as O
we O
slowly O
realized O
our O
wait B-AS
had O
become O
an O
hour O
from O
the O
promised O
20 O
min O
, O
the O
server B-AS
noted O
upon O
our O
inquiry O
that O
they O
recognized O
and O
remembered O
us O
and O
would O
seat O
us O
soon O
- O
rolling O
eye O
look O
- O
matched O
by O
a O
tone O
protesting O
the O
uncouth O
annoyance O
. O

Seated O
by O
a O
moody O
hostess B-AS
and O
presented O
a O
menu B-AS
that O
included O
live O
food O
- O
samples O
. O

But O
the O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
' O
s O
attitude B-AS
will O
make O
me O
rethink O
about O
returning O
. O

We O
ordered O
1 O
/ O
2 O
bottle O
of O
Gruner O
, O
2 O
appetizers B-AS
- O
foie B-AS
gras I-AS
and I-AS
oysters I-AS
, O
2 O
entrees B-AS
- O
steak O
and O
diver O
scallops B-AS
, O
and O
1 O
dessert B-AS
, O
the O
pastry B-AS
chef I-AS
' O
s O
favorite O
a O
mixture O
of O
crushed O
avocado O
, O
salt O
glazed O
caramel O
and O
lime O
sorbet O
( O
which O
really O
tasted O
like O
margarita O
infused O
guacamole O
, O
to O
try O
only O
if O
you O
' O
re O
feeling O
wd O
- O
50 O
adventurous O
) O
for O
around O
$ O
100 O
. O

On O
our O
second O
trip O
, O
our O
waiter B-AS
had O
an O
attitude O
, O
was O
slow O
to O
bring O
/ O
refill O
drinks B-AS
, O
and O
we O
had O
to O
flag O
him O
down O
for O
EVERYTHING O
. O

We O
had O
to O
request O
water B-AS
and I-AS
chips I-AS
( I-AS
tostades I-AS
) I-AS
and O
salsa O
three O
times O
( O
the O
third O
time O
my O
date O
had O
to O
go O
and O
track O
down O
the O
waitress B-AS
) O
before O
finally O
being O
served B-AS
( O
by O
the O
busser O
) O
and O
the O
place B-AS
wasn O
' O
t O
even O
a O
quarter O
full O
. O

The O
service B-AS
is O
ok O
since O
it O
is O
new O
and O
the O
staff B-AS
didn O
' O
t O
know O
the O
food B-AS
items O
too O
well O
. O

sirloin O
was O
spectacular O
- O
- O
tender O
, O
succulent O
and O
savory O
- O
- O
and O
even O
the O
salad B-AS
and O
dessert B-AS
( O
items B-AS
where O
you O
might O
be O
willing O
to O
cut O
a O
steakhouse O
some O
slack O
) O
were O
superb O
. O

The O
ambience B-AS
is O
horrible O
but O
the O
food B-AS
is O
incredible O
. O

They O
have O
even O
just O
expanded O
to O
include O
lunch B-AS
hours O
at O
very O
reasonable O
prices B-AS
. O

Although O
the O
pricing B-AS
is O
on O
the O
more O
expensive O
side O
, O
this O
is O
a O
must O
try O
restaurant O
for O
its O
food B-AS
. O

! O
While O
you O
are O
there O
, O
try O
the O
stuffed B-AS
chicken I-AS
wings I-AS
, O
the O
salmon B-AS
and O
take O
a O
stroll O
into O
the O
restroom O
. O

Hot O
foods B-AS
selection O
every O
weekday O
for O
lunch B-AS
. O

Although O
the O
prices B-AS
is O
a O
bit O
on O
the O
high O
, O
you O
do O
get O
big O
portions B-AS
for O
it O
. O

Expect O
to O
stand O
around O
for O
a O
while O
before O
one O
of O
the O
waiters B-AS
desides O
that O
they O
can O
be O
bothered O
to O
actually O
get O
you O
to O
a O
seat B-AS
. O

and O
you O
have O
to O
order O
through O
a O
pane O
of O
bulletproof B-AS
glass I-AS
, O
but O
the O
fact O
of O
the O
matter O
is O
, O
after O
a O
night O
of O
hard O
drinkin O
' O
, O
college O
style B-AS
, O
nothing O
hits O
the O
spot O
like O
a O
big O
box O
of O
inexpensive O
chicken O
and O
fries B-AS
. O

If O
it O
' O
s O
just O
a O
quick O
martini B-AS
at O
the O
bar B-AS
( O
which O
I O
recommend O
Jeffery O
' O
s O
) O
or O
a O
mind O
blowing O
Roast B-AS
Chicken I-AS
, O
go O
to O
Village O
! O

40 O
minutes O
later O
, O
the O
waitress B-AS
finally O
looked O
at O
our O
table O
and O
we O
asked O
about O
our O
dishes B-AS
. O

Went O
for O
lunch B-AS
but O
wanted O
to O
order O
a O
la O
carte O
, O
which O
was O
so O
highly O
discouraged O
by O
the O
waiter B-AS
( O
pushing O
the O
10 O
. O

This O
restaurant O
was O
a O
great O
value B-AS
, O
even O
though O
I O
know O
nothing O
about O
the O
prix B-AS
fixe I-AS
menu I-AS
. O

Though O
the O
service B-AS
leaves O
a O
lot O
to O
be O
desired O
, O
and O
the O
waitstaff B-AS
runs O
around O
like O
chickens B-AS
without O
heads O
, O
the O
beer B-AS
is O
cold O
, O
the O
sake B-AS
is O
hot O
, O
and O
the O
sushi B-AS
is O
out O
of O
this O
world O
! O

I O
will O
have O
to O
say O
the O
food B-AS
was O
good O
and O
the O
chance O
to O
sample O
wines B-AS
not O
often O
found O
in O
other O
restaurants O
was O
a O
positive O
but O
the O
abyssmal O
service B-AS
left O
a O
bad O
taste O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
fun O
- O
- O
dark O
, O
pulsing O
, O
basement O
room B-AS
; O
a O
place O
where O
you O
feel O
like O
you O
can O
relax O
. O

i O
also O
like O
their O
cocktail B-AS
menu I-AS
and O
dessert B-AS
menu I-AS
( O
try O
the O
black B-AS
tea I-AS
rose I-AS
ice I-AS
cream I-AS
and O
the O
coconout O
waffles O
) O
. O

Order O
the O
jalapeno B-AS
cheddar I-AS
potatoes O
- O
My O
meal B-AS
tasted O
like O
mom O
' O
s O
homemade O
cooking B-AS
! O

Sadly O
, O
many O
people O
feel O
the O
need O
to O
berate O
their O
server B-AS
for O
a O
stronger O
drink B-AS
. O

Martinis B-AS
from O
the O
bar B-AS
are O
mixed O
at O
the O
size O
of O
1 O
1 O
/ O
2 O
drinks B-AS
, O
and O
the O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
leaves O
the O
whole O
glass O
there O
, O
returning O
to O
pour O
you O
your O
remaining O
drink O
as O
your O
glass B-AS
empties I-AS
. O

They O
moved O
us O
upstairs O
to O
an O
area O
where O
they O
were O
setting O
up O
for O
a O
private O
party O
- O
- O
we O
had O
no O
server B-AS
, O
and O
had O
to O
flag O
down O
people O
setting O
up O
for O
the O
party O
to O
get O
us O
drinks B-AS
, O
silverware O
, O
water B-AS
, O
etc O
. O

Shaved O
tuna B-AS
and O
small O
tapioca B-AS
balls I-AS
- O
- O
a O
playful O
substitute O
for O
roe B-AS
- O
- O
float O
in O
an O
addictive O
, O
tart O
- O
smooth O
pool O
of O
coconut B-AS
water I-AS
and O
kaffir B-AS
lime I-AS
juice I-AS
. O

We O
had O
over O
100 O
beers B-AS
to O
choose O
from O
and O
the O
food B-AS
and O
service B-AS
was O
excellent O
. O

For O
2 O
patrons O
paying O
over O
$ O
100 O
for O
dinner B-AS
, O
you O
' O
d O
think O
that O
the O
waiter B-AS
would O
check O
to O
see O
if O
everything O
was O
okay O
with O
the O
dining O
experience O
, O
and O
he O
certainly O
did O
not O
. O

Yes O
you O
have O
to O
wait O
to O
be O
seated O
and O
because O
its O
small O
there O
is O
no O
waiting B-AS
area I-AS
and O
the O
seat O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
was O
all O
taken O
. O

Appetizers B-AS
, O
entrees B-AS
and O
desserts B-AS
suffered O
from O
a O
lack O
of O
variety O
in O
taste B-AS
- O
- O
all O
were O
nicely O
presented O
but O
none O
rose O
much O
above O
the O
level O
of O
something O
the O
average O
person O
could O
either O
cook O
for O
onesself O
or O
get O
at O
a O
well O
- O
run O
diner O
. O

The O
food O
and O
cocktails B-AS
at O
SushiSamba O
were O
very O
good O
; O
however O
the O
seating B-AS
is O
so O
tight O
and O
uncomfortable O
and O
the O
service O
so O
rushed O
that O
I O
will O
probably O
never O
go O
back O
. O

The O
slices B-AS
are O
pricey O
for O
the O
neighborhood B-AS
( O
and O
always O
has O
been O
) O
, O
but O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
is O
always O
packed O
attests O
to O
the O
value O
. O

Came O
here O
for O
a O
b O
- O
day O
and O
ended O
up O
waiting B-AS
so O
long O
even O
for O
a O
reservation B-AS
. O

I O
saw O
a O
waitress B-AS
yell O
at O
2 O
customers O
for O
moving O
a O
table O
out O
a O
little O
bit O
in O
order O
to O
have O
more O
seating O
space B-AS
. O

I O
had O
to O
wait O
1hr O
since O
I O
got O
there O
around O
8pm O
but O
you O
could O
have O
a O
few O
drinks B-AS
by O
the O
bar B-AS
since O
the O
ambiance B-AS
is O
very O
loungy O
/ O
club O
like O
. O

The O
server B-AS
( O
blond O
guy B-AS
with O
blue O
eyes O
, O
we O
don O
' O
t O
even O
know O
his O
name O
because O
he O
came O
to O
the O
table O
only O
twice O
) O
is O
rude O
and O
incapable O
and O
he O
didn O
' O
t O
want O
to O
help O
for O
anything O
at O
all O
. O

After O
the O
appetizers B-AS
, O
which O
were O
the O
only O
saving O
grace O
( O
BBQ O
chips O
, O
spinach O
, O
fried O
bread O
) O
, O
the O
servers B-AS
descending O
and O
without O
asking O
started O
taking O
our O
plates O
away O
. O

I O
visited O
the O
Park O
Slope O
location O
on O
Fifth O
Avenue O
, O
and O
was O
impressed O
with O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
and O
that O
they O
offered O
chicken B-AS
fried I-AS
steak I-AS
. O

For O
dessert B-AS
, O
try O
this O
pudding B-AS
, O
translated O
Nipple O
of O
Venus O
. O

Sushi O
is O
consistently O
fresh O
, O
service B-AS
pleasant O
Sushi B-AS
rice I-AS
is O
a O
bit O
hard O
. O

We O
recently O
went O
for O
dinner B-AS
with O
two O
kids O
and O
the O
staff B-AS
were O
very O
accomodating O
even O
without O
reservations O
. O

Our O
dinner B-AS
party O
of O
four O
all O
found O
the O
food B-AS
better O
than O
average O
and O
of O
sizeable O
portions O
. O

I O
ordered O
a O
medium O
Cub O
burger O
and O
it O
came O
out O
well O
done O
, O
not O
that O
my O
server B-AS
would O
have O
noticed O
since O
we O
didn O
' O
t O
see O
her O
again O
until O
she O
brought O
the O
check B-AS
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
knew O
his O
menu B-AS
and O
what O
to O
recommend O
. O

We O
didn O
' O
t O
see O
him O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
night O
, O
the O
other O
courses O
come O
out O
sporadically O
, O
and O
no O
one O
ever O
asked O
if O
we O
wanted O
more O
wine B-AS
( O
which O
we O
did O
) O
or O
refilled O
our O
water B-AS
- O
- O
even O
after O
we O
flagged O
down O
another O
waiter B-AS
, O
nothing O
happened O
. O

We O
wouldn O
' O
t O
bother O
quibbling O
over O
the O
price B-AS
of O
a O
few O
drinks B-AS
anyway O
but O
I O
wonder O
why O
they O
would O
offer O
if O
they O
weren O
' O
t O
intending O
to O
back O
it O
up O
. O

The O
waitstaff B-AS
is O
charming O
and O
knowledgeable O
about O
the O
menu B-AS
. O

the O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
that O
of O
a O
diner B-AS
, O
but O
if O
you O
get O
a O
booth O
that O
is O
the O
best O
! O

We O
had O
2 O
servers B-AS
helping O
our O
party O
of O
12 O
, O
screwed O
up O
3 O
orders O
had O
to O
re O
- O
do O
( O
frightful O
you O
never O
know O
what O
chef B-AS
' O
s O
mood O
is O
when O
they O
make O
mistakes O
) O
. O

Although O
we O
didn O
' O
t O
have O
a O
reservation B-AS
, O
my O
husband O
and O
I O
enjoyed O
the O
food B-AS
and O
drinks O
at O
the O
kitchen O
side O
seating B-AS
. O

No O
dress B-AS
codes I-AS
, O
no O
attitudes B-AS
, O
plenty O
of O
comfort O
companionship O
, O
a O
great O
place B-AS
to O
relax O
in O
an O
always O
busy O
Midtown O
. O

It O
' O
s O
the O
nicest O
place B-AS
to O
nurse O
a O
cup B-AS
of I-AS
coffee I-AS
( O
and O
the O
coffee O
is O
good O
) O
, O
especially O
out O
in O
the O
little O
back O
garden B-AS
. O

My O
friend O
and O
I O
enjoyed O
choosing O
from O
a O
very O
diverse O
menu B-AS
of O
appetizers B-AS
and O
entrees B-AS
. O

For O
an O
appetizer B-AS
, O
I O
had O
soba O
in O
pho B-AS
- I-AS
like I-AS
broth I-AS
with I-AS
dumplings I-AS
, O
and O
I O
already O
liked O
the O
restaurant B-AS
. O

Across O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
and O
even O
within O
a O
single O
dish B-AS
, O
there O
is O
a O
stunning O
variety O
of O
scintillating O
, O
distinct O
flavors O
. O

* O
Rude O
waiter B-AS
- O
he O
kept O
pushing O
us O
to O
get O
appetizer B-AS
( O
after O
been O
told O
twice O
that O
we O
would O
like O
to O
start O
ordering O
entree B-AS
) O
and O
after O
dinner B-AS
, O
told O
us O
to O
check O
out O
the O
shelf O
ourselves O
on O
our O
way O
to O
the O
restroom O
for O
dessert O
menu O
. O

Our O
reservation B-AS
was O
for O
9 O
, O
didn O
' O
t O
get O
seated O
until O
9 O
: O
20 O
with O
no O
acknowledgment O
by O
the O
staff B-AS
of O
the O
delay O
. O

Everyting O
I O
ate O
there O
was O
incredible O
from O
the O
Tseukune B-AS
( I-AS
chicken I-AS
dumplings I-AS
) I-AS
to O
the O
black B-AS
bass I-AS
special I-AS
, O
right O
down O
to O
the O
velety O
chocolate B-AS
pudding I-AS
I O
had O
for O
dessert B-AS
. O

I O
would O
get O
the O
raisin B-AS
bagels I-AS
and O
occasionally O
a O
plain O
with O
lox B-AS
and I-AS
cream I-AS
cheese I-AS
, O
but O
now O
I O
go O
straight O
for O
the O
lox O
since O
I O
don O
' O
t O
get O
there O
often O
. O

At O
dinner B-AS
on O
a O
Saturday O
night O
, O
I O
was O
enthused O
by O
the O
bustling O
, O
unpretentious O
crowd O
and O
the O
lusciously O
warm O
lighting B-AS
. O

Our O
agreed O
favorite O
is O
the O
orrechiete B-AS
with I-AS
sausage I-AS
and I-AS
chicken I-AS
( O
usually O
the O
waiters O
are O
kind O
enough O
to O
split O
the O
dish B-AS
in O
half O
so O
you O
get O
to O
sample O
both O
meats O
) O
. O

Instead O
of O
being O
smart O
business B-AS
people O
and O
treating O
us O
as O
paying O
customers O
, O
we O
were O
told O
they O
do O
not O
serve O
drinks B-AS
, O
only O
food O
( O
only O
food O
? O

Instead O
of O
going O
to O
a O
fun O
lounge B-AS
after I-AS
dinner I-AS
, O
as O
planned O
, O
everyone O
had O
paid O
so O
much O
, O
that O
we O
went O
to O
a O
dive O
bar B-AS
for O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
night O
for O
cheap O
drinks B-AS
. O

One O
time O
the O
waitress B-AS
left O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
our O
dinner B-AS
. O

When O
I O
told O
the O
staff B-AS
that O
I O
was O
displeased O
and O
wanted O
to O
write O
a O
letter O
to O
the O
owner O
, O
I O
was O
told O
the O
owner O
had O
no O
name O
and O
that O
I O
should O
just O
give O
the O
letter O
with O
no O
formal O
greeting O
( O
Dear O
Pick O
a O
Bagel B-AS
Owner I-AS
) O
to O
the O
cashier O
and O
that O
she O
would O
pass O
it O
along O
. O

beside O
i O
have O
to O
wait O
long O
time O
with O
my O
food B-AS
, O
waiter B-AS
service I-AS
ok O
but O
unfriendly O
. O

only O
drawback O
is O
that O
space B-AS
is O
a O
bit O
tight O
at O
some O
tables O
, O
but O
all O
in O
all O
a O
great O
place B-AS
to O
eat O
that O
we O
will O
be O
back O
to O
many O
more O
times O
! O

Yet O
, O
the O
place O
was O
emptyIts O
too O
bad O
because O
the O
food B-AS
is O
authentic O
and O
price O
is O
very O
reasonable O
considering O
the O
location O
and O
the O
quality B-AS
( O
eg O
. O

Once O
we O
' O
d O
finished O
eating O
, O
it O
was O
another O
15 O
minutes O
before O
we O
saw O
someone O
who O
would O
bring O
us O
the O
check B-AS
- O
and O
after O
running O
my O
credit O
card O
, O
the O
waitress B-AS
had O
the O
audacity O
to O
write O
cash O
only O
in O
the O
tip O
portion O
of O
the O
receipt O
! O

Though O
it O
might O
be O
a O
wait B-AS
and O
the O
service B-AS
might O
leave O
a O
little O
to O
be O
desired O
, O
anyone O
that O
has O
ever O
eaten O
there O
agrees O
that O
the O
food B-AS
is O
worth O
it O
. O

We O
ask O
the O
waiter B-AS
where O
' O
s O
the O
chocolate B-AS
? O

I O
' O
d O
like O
to O
think O
that O
my O
brunch B-AS
was O
an O
isolated O
incident O
, O
but O
just O
in O
case O
it O
is O
not O
, O
DON O
' O
T O
GET O
THE O
STEAK B-AS
AND O
EGGS B-AS
. O

Again O
in O
a O
group O
6 O
months O
ago O
, O
the O
service B-AS
was O
even O
worse O
this O
time O
, O
practically O
begging O
for O
water O
and O
other O
drinks B-AS
while O
we O
waited O
an O
age O
just O
to O
get O
our O
orders O
taken O
. O

The O
waitress B-AS
took O
forever O
to O
take O
our O
order O
, O
we O
waited O
almost O
an O
hour O
for O
our O
appetizers B-AS
, O
and O
then O
she O
asked O
us O
whether O
she O
even O
put O
the O
order O
in O
- O
- O
as O
if O
we O
would O
even O
know O
. O

My O
french B-AS
toast I-AS
was O
two O
slices O
of O
bread B-AS
cut O
in O
half O
- O
the O
perfect O
breakfast B-AS
for O
a O
4 O
year O
old O
. O

the O
food B-AS
at O
this O
humble O
bastion O
of O
venezuelan O
home B-AS
cooking I-AS
is O
delicious O
- O
AND O
- O
authentic O
( O
how O
does O
this O
place O
rate O
only O
a O
19 O
in O
zagat O
' O
s O
? O

i O
went O
there O
for O
dinner B-AS
on O
friday O
night O
, O
the O
waiter B-AS
had O
a O
terrible O
attitude O
. O

Food B-AS
turned O
out O
to O
be O
descent O
, O
but O
the O
waitress B-AS
disappeared O
from O
the O
moment O
we O
placed O
the O
order O
untill O
she O
came O
back O
with O
the O
check O
. O

But O
my O
lunch B-AS
was O
very O
light O
with O
a O
wrap B-AS
, O
not O
tortilla O
, O
but O
something O
thinner O
, O
a O
rice O
paper O
sort O
of O
crepe O
, O
that O
had O
lettuce B-AS
and O
spicy O
cabbage O
and O
thin O
sliced B-AS
beef I-AS
. O

The O
all O
- O
you O
- O
can O
- O
eat O
buffet O
( O
available O
for O
lunch O
or O
dinner B-AS
from O
Tuesday O
through O
Sunday O
) O
features O
many O
of O
the O
takeout B-AS
choices I-AS
plus I-AS
dishes I-AS
like O
stewed B-AS
beef I-AS
, O
supremely O
tender O
barbecue O
ribs O
and O
a O
perfect O
potato B-AS
salad I-AS
. O

I O
think O
that O
argentine B-AS
cuisine I-AS
can O
be O
match O
more O
interesting O
better O
that O
the O
insipid O
expirience O
that O
I O
had O
in O
this O
overpriced O
place B-AS
. O

We O
had O
a O
plate B-AS
of I-AS
smoked I-AS
meats I-AS
, O
some O
stinky O
cheeses O
( O
that O
' O
s O
how O
they O
were O
described O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
) O
, O
delicious O
marinated O
anchovies O
, O
and O
crostini O
with O
various O
vegetable B-AS
toppings I-AS
. O

We O
also O
had O
the O
egg B-AS
platter I-AS
, O
vanilla O
- O
coconut O
pancakes O
, O
and O
the O
Good O
signature B-AS
breakfast I-AS
( O
little O
bit O
of O
everything O
) O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
two O
rounds O
of O
drinks B-AS
, O
the O
bartender O
and O
owner B-AS
were O
a O
hoot O
. O

i O
always O
scour O
citysearch O
for O
recommended O
dishes B-AS
so O
here O
are O
mine O
: O
start O
with O
pork O
and O
pear B-AS
appetizer I-AS
( O
of O
asian B-AS
pear I-AS
and O
pork O
) O
, O
have O
eel O
and O
cream O
cheese O
on O
top O
of O
multigrain B-AS
rice I-AS
( O
but O
do O
share O
it O
' O
s O
big O
portion O
) O
and O
you O
must O
try O
beef B-AS
with O
gingseng O
in O
stone O
pot O
. O

At O
least O
the O
entertainment B-AS
was O
free O
, O
as O
we O
were O
able O
to O
witness O
one O
customer O
wooing O
a O
waitress B-AS
, O
and O
another O
being O
drenched O
in O
milk B-AS
. O

We O
weren O
' O
t O
even O
offered O
a O
dinner B-AS
menu I-AS
and O
the O
waitress B-AS
didn O
' O
t O
even O
notice O
that O
we O
wanted O
drinks B-AS
until O
after O
I O
ordered O
them O
from O
the O
bar O
myself O
. O

This O
place O
is O
even O
good O
for O
just O
drinks B-AS
after O
work O
( O
nice O
bar B-AS
) O
I O
am O
going O
back O
there O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
get O
a O
chance B-AS
. O

Tuesdays B-AS
are O
Wine O
Lovers O
nights O
, O
where O
everything O
on O
their O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
is O
half O
off O
- O
it O
' O
s O
a O
great O
deal O
. O

My O
water B-AS
was O
filled O
like O
eight O
times O
, O
good O
, O
fast O
service B-AS
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
our O
server B-AS
was O
dancing O
and O
posing O
by O
the O
bar B-AS
. O

Waited O
for O
a O
table B-AS
, O
got O
disgusting O
martinis B-AS
at O
the O
bar B-AS
, O
and O
sat O
down O
. O

During O
dinner B-AS
, O
we O
sat O
drinkless O
once O
again O
, O
as O
the O
server O
and O
owner B-AS
never O
checked O
on O
us O
. O

We O
sat O
at O
one O
of O
the O
2 O
large O
tables B-AS
with O
benches O
inside O
the O
door O
instead O
of O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
- O
the O
only O
options O
available O
at O
7 O
: O
15 O
when O
we O
arrived O
. O

If O
it O
was O
outstanding O
I O
could O
see O
it O
as O
a O
nice O
change B-AS
for O
lunch B-AS
, O
but O
the O
peanut O
butter O
wasn O
' O
t O
any O
better O
than O
one O
you O
could O
buy O
at O
any O
grocery O
store O
and O
the O
chocolate O
peanut O
butter O
brownie O
was O
horrible O
. O

As O
I O
was O
paying O
the O
bill B-AS
, O
the O
waiter B-AS
would O
look O
over O
my O
shoulder O
to O
see O
how O
much O
tip B-AS
I O
would O
be O
giving O
as O
where O
I O
could O
almost O
feel O
him O
breathing O
on O
my O
ear O
. O

I O
' O
ll O
second O
the O
recommedation O
for O
the O
Purity B-AS
- O
- O
which O
has O
much O
faster O
, O
better O
service O
at O
half O
the O
price B-AS
and O
a O
whole O
lot O
more O
selection O
. O

Del O
Frisco O
' O
s O
is O
pricey O
and O
I O
was O
seated O
in O
a O
leper O
locker B-AS
room I-AS
area I-AS
, O
but O
the O
food B-AS
was O
totally O
fantastic O
. O

We O
waited O
30 O
minutes O
to O
be O
seated O
, O
40 O
minutes O
for O
water B-AS
, O
bread B-AS
, O
menus B-AS
, O
30 O
more O
for O
wine B-AS
and O
soft O
drinks B-AS
and O
when O
the O
food O
finally O
arrived O
an O
hour O
later O
, O
it O
was O
inedible O
, O
burned O
on O
top O
from O
sitting O
under O
a O
heat O
lamp O
. O

The O
tea B-AS
wasn O
' O
t O
much O
good O
, O
the O
menu O
and O
the O
food B-AS
was O
pretty O
much O
the O
same O
as O
the O
$ O
5 O
curry B-AS
row I-AS
fare I-AS
and O
the O
waiter B-AS
need O
constant O
prodding O
. O

This O
is O
one O
of O
my O
first O
dining B-AS
experiences I-AS
in O
NYC O
when O
I O
first O
moved O
here O
10 O
years O
ago O
, O
and O
although O
Hudson O
Corner O
is O
consistently O
good O
, O
it O
has O
gone O
downhill O
over O
the O
years O
in O
both O
food B-AS
quality I-AS
and O
service B-AS
! O

The O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
are O
friendly O
, O
but O
they O
disappear O
after O
they O
take O
initial O
drink B-AS
and O
food B-AS
order I-AS
. O

The O
waitress B-AS
came O
back O
to O
our O
table B-AS
several O
times O
to O
ensure O
we O
were O
well O
catered O
for O
. O

The O
decor B-AS
there O
is O
nothing O
special O
, O
though O
somehow O
the O
service B-AS
manages O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
large O
crowds O
in O
an O
efficient O
, O
friendly O
manner B-AS
. O

The O
mussels B-AS
, I-AS
garlic I-AS
shrimp I-AS
and O
jamon B-AS
serrano I-AS
are O
killer O
, O
while O
the O
creamy O
queixo O
cabrales O
- O
- O
a O
regional O
Spanish B-AS
blue I-AS
cheese I-AS
- O
- O
makes O
a O
fine O
topper O
for O
the O
dense O
homemade B-AS
bread I-AS
. O

Hunan O
Delight O
has O
one O
page O
in O
their O
menu B-AS
full O
of O
Vegetarian B-AS
dishes I-AS
. O

But O
the O
karaoke B-AS
downstairs I-AS
is O
the O
real O
draw O
: O
You O
and O
your O
friends O
can O
sing O
yourself O
silly O
in O
absolute O
privacy O
, O
for O
nothing O
more O
than O
the O
cost B-AS
of O
dinner B-AS
and O
drinks B-AS
. O

The O
place B-AS
was O
packed O
, O
but O
it O
didn O
' O
t O
effect O
our O
service B-AS
or O
getting O
our O
food O
/ O
drinks O
promptly O
. O

The O
kitchen B-AS
would O
do O
well O
to O
offer O
more O
desserts B-AS
- O
- O
the O
one O
option O
of O
Eight O

Sticky O

connotes I-AS
a O
Chinese B-AS
fruit I-AS

- O
- O
but O
the O
drinks O
downstairs O
encourage O
one O
to O
linger O
. O

We O
started O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
with O
a O
round B-AS
of I-AS
mojitos I-AS
, O
which O
were O
amazing O
, O
and O
went O
to O
our O
reserved O
table O
. O

We O
had O
a O
horrible O
night O
here O
stemming O
from O
intolerable O
service B-AS
, O
no O
appologies O
after O
our O
food B-AS
never O
came O
out O
after O
waiting B-AS
longer O
than O
an O
hour O
and O
a O
half O
, O
and O
a O
plate B-AS
of O
crusty O
bread O
thrown O
at O
us O
when O
we O
asked O
for O
their O
signature O
corn B-AS
bread I-AS
. O

SQC O
is O
great O
in O
the O
evening O
, O
the O
light B-AS
is O
excellent O
and O
it O
' O
s O
perfect O
to O
sit O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
, O
eat O
oysters B-AS
on O
the O
half O
shell O
and O
have O
a O
glass O
of O
wine O
. O

And O
the O
room B-AS
is O
VERY O
noisy O
, O
but O
I O
suppose O
that O
' O
s O
because O
everyone O
is O
having O
a O
good O
time B-AS
. O

seated O
promptly O
; O
while O
waitstaff B-AS
seemed O
confused O
as O
to O
what O
they O
should O
be O
doing O
( O
one O
actually O
looked O
at O
my O
partner O
' O
s O
mojito B-AS
and O
asked O
if O
she O
had O
' O
put O
her O
dinner B-AS
in O
the O
glass B-AS
' O
) O
, O
our O
waiter O
appeared O
experienced O
. O

Noodle B-AS
soup I-AS
quantities I-AS
are O
huge O
- O
so O
don O
' O
t O
go O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
menu B-AS
- O
the O
rest O
are O
at O
par O
with O
the O
rest O
of O
Chinatown O
. O

Once O
we O
got O
our O
appetizers B-AS
, O
it O
was O
ANOTHER O
40 O
minutes O
before O
we O
got O
our O
entrees B-AS
, O
which O
weren O
' O
t O
hot O
and O
which O
were O
soggy O
and O
tasteless O
. O

The O
grilled B-AS
calimari I-AS

scrumptious O

the O

, O
make O
sure O
someone O
has O
the O
roasted B-AS
fruits I-AS
and O
someone O
else O
has O
the O
expresso B-AS
with I-AS
ice I-AS
cream I-AS
. O

The O
strong O
suit O
of O
this O
place O
is O
the O
decor B-AS
, O
alas O
we O
was O
seated O
and O
served B-AS
by O
some O
guy O
who O
looked O
like O
he O
was O
out O
of O
a O
seedy O
70 O
' O
s O
porn O
movie O
and O
everything O
went O
downhill O
after O
. O

We O
had O
an O
hour O
wait O
past O
our O
reservation B-AS
time O
, O
so O
dealing O
with O
the O
bar B-AS
scene I-AS
was O
not O
helping O
things O
. O

When O
we O
mentioned O
it O
to O
the O
waiter B-AS
, O
he O
shrugged O
and O
asked O
what O
we O
expected O
from O
a O
glass B-AS
wine I-AS
. O

I O
had O
the O
waiters B-AS
bring O
back O
so O
much O
meat B-AS
that O
that O
asked O
me O
if O
I O
wanted O
Flank O
steak B-AS
for O
dessert B-AS
. O

This O
is O
the O
kind O
of O
place B-AS
that O
is O
suppose O
to O
have O
pushy O
waiters B-AS
and O
a O
loud O
atmosphere B-AS
. O

The O
owner B-AS
roasts O
his O
own O
meats B-AS
and O
makes O
fabulous O
and O
interesting O
sandwiches B-AS
- O
- O
the O
house B-AS
- I-AS
roasted I-AS
ham I-AS
with I-AS
celery I-AS
- I-AS
root I-AS
salad I-AS
and O
tomatoes O
on O
a O
baguette O
deserves O
a O
prize O
. O

The O
waitress B-AS
made O
a O
mental O
note O
about O
it O
and O
brought O
out O
a O
special O
dessert B-AS
without O
being O
asked O
. O

some O
sweaty O
so O
frazzled O
, O
when O
we O
returned O
both O
an O
app B-AS
and O
entree O
, O
the O
manager B-AS
didn O
' O
t O
even O
come O
to O
speak O
to O
us O
. O

Green B-AS
bean I-AS
salad I-AS
was O
tasty O
but O
could O
have O
used O
a O
bit O
more O
of O
a O
kick O
Baby B-AS
backs I-AS
- O
Wow O
! O

We O
arrived O
at O
Crema O
at O
7 O
: O
50 O
and O
the O
hostess B-AS
advised O
she O
had O
no O
record O
of O
my O
reservation B-AS
. O

I O
can O
' O
t O
resist O
the O
soul B-AS
chicken I-AS
whether O
I O
am O
at O
VP2 O
or O
Red O
Bamboo O
, O
but O
I O
' O
ve O
been O
a O
good O
girl O
and O
at O
least O
tried O
some O
other O
menu B-AS
items I-AS
and O
everything O
, O
and O
I O
mean O
EVERYTHING O
I O
tried O
has O
proved O
amazing O
. O

The O
scene B-AS
is O
a O
bit O
much O
some O
time O
, O
but O
the O
food B-AS
is O
worth O
it O
. O

Informal O
servers B-AS
sashay O
past O
plastic B-AS
chairs I-AS
and O
patterned O
booths O
, O
ducking O
enormous O
lampshades O
with O
cheerful O
insouciance O
. O

Although O
the O
dining B-AS
area I-AS
is O
a O
bit O
small O
you O
' O
ll O
feel O
at O
home O
as O
the O
owner B-AS
is O
very O
friendly O
and O
talkative O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
always O
great O
, O
and O
if O
you O
' O
re O
there O
for O
brunch B-AS
, O
be O
sure O
to O
try O
their O
bloody O
mary O
! O

When O
I O
walked O
back O
to O
the O
counter B-AS
, O
the O
two O
staff B-AS
people O
immediately O
retreated O
to O
the O
back B-AS
room I-AS
, O
glanced O
back O
at O
me O
attempting O
to O
get O
their O
attention O
and O
immediately O
returned O
to O
wasting O
time O
. O

For O
appetizer B-AS
, O
I O
like O
Potli O
Samosa O
, O
but O
sometimes O
it O
is O
improperly O
cooked O
, O
which O
ruins O
the O
taste B-AS
. O

The O
service B-AS
isn O
' O
t O
fantastic O
and O
the O
seating B-AS
is O
a O
bit O
tight O
but O
if O
you O
aren O
' O
t O
looking O
Four O
Seasons O
type O
quality B-AS
, O
then O
this O
is O
the O
perfect O
spot O
to O
meet O
some O
friends O
for O
dinner B-AS
or O
lunch B-AS
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
and O
busboy O
apologized O
for O
the O
host B-AS
who O
claims O
to O
have O
done O
this O
many O
times O
in O
his O
13 O
years O
in O
the O
biz O
. O

The O
new B-AS
server I-AS
we O
had O
was O
surprisingly O
well O
- O
versed O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
and O
gave O
really O
solid O
service B-AS
. O

We O
were O
promptly O
seated O
- O
the O
waitress B-AS
was O
very O
attentive O
, O
got O
us O
drinks B-AS
and O
menus B-AS
. O

We O
only O
saw O
2 O
- O
3 O
boring O
appitizers B-AS
on O
the O
menu B-AS
and O
not O
a O
lot O
of O
choices O
of O
meat B-AS
to O
select O
from O
. O

It O
' O
s O
called O
OYSTER B-AS
BAR I-AS
, O
and O
yet O
no O
oyster B-AS
selection I-AS
at O
all O
! O

It O
' O
s O
so O
good O
, O
we O
send O
gophers O
from O
Wall O
St O
to O
pick O
up O
pies B-AS
for O
lunch B-AS
. O

Went O
to O
dinner B-AS
with O
some O
girlfriends O
on O
Wednesday O
at O
Calico O
Jacks O
and O
had O
a O
fun O
time B-AS
. O

Meat B-AS
wasn O
' O
t O
fall O
- O
off O
- O
the O
bone O
( O
a O
sign O
of O
over O
- O
cooking O
) O
but O
was O
tender O
and O
had O
deep O
flavor B-AS
. O

They O
draw O
you O
in O
with O
a O
fancy O
looking O
decore B-AS
which O
obviously O
cost O
a O
mint O
, O
ply O
you O
with O
overpriced O
wines B-AS
( O
one O
bottle O
I O
knew O
was O
a O
6 O
$ O
and O
they O
had O
the O
nerve O
to O
charge O
40 O
) O
This O
place O
sufferes O
from O
the O
same O
problem O
Areos O
does O
, O
it O
rests O
on O
its O
reputation O
. O

Waited O
8 O
minutes O
for O
them O
to O
set O
up O
the O
table O
, O
another O
10 O
to O
take O
our O
orders O
and O
1 O
hr O
plus O
later O
for O
the O
waitress B-AS
to O
say O
the O
food B-AS
is O
coming O
in O
2 O
minutes O
. O

The O
chef O
who O
is O
a O
bundle O
of O
personality O
came O
to O
tell O
us O
all O
about O
the O
special O
menu B-AS
for O
the O
wine B-AS
room I-AS
. O

While O
there O
are O
now O
a O
few O
appetizers B-AS
, O
the O
traditional B-AS
thali I-AS
( I-AS
sampling I-AS
platter I-AS
) I-AS
is O
often O
your O
best O
bet O
; O
fixed O
nightly O
menu O
changes O
daily O
. O

I O
ordered O
the O
eggs O
benedict O
, O
my O
wife O
a O
burger B-AS
( O
one O
o O
the O
best O
i O
had O
in O
a O
long O
time O
) O
and O
the O
kids O
ordered O
french B-AS
toast I-AS
and O
belgium O

Top O
it O
off O
with O
one O
of O
many O
Polish O
bottled O
beer B-AS
and O
youre O
in O
food B-AS
heaven O
. O

I O
went O
with O
my O
sister O
and O
neither O
of O
us O
had O
wine B-AS
so O
the O
final B-AS
bill I-AS
was O
a O
bit O
shocking O
. O

While O
the O
people O
here O
were O
nice O
and O
the O
service B-AS
was O
very O
good O
, O
the O
food B-AS
was O
not O
very O
good O
- O
it O
was O
extremely O
greasy O
, O
the O
place O
did O
not O
offer O
alternatives O
such O
as O
egg B-AS
whites I-AS
and O
PAM B-AS
spray O
instead O
of O
oil B-AS
, O
coffee O
was O
average O
Crystal O
Rock O
Office O
Flavored O
Coffee O
- O
not O
the O
good O
coffee O
. O

We O
were O
seated O
promptly O
, O
and O
after O
an O
inordinate O
wait B-AS
, O
somebody O
took O
our O
drink B-AS
order O
and O
disappeared O
for O
half O
an O
hour O
. O

Zero O
decor B-AS
, O
this O
is O
not O
a O
date O
place O
- O
- O
just O
a O
great O
place O
to O
get O
a O
quick O
, O
tasty O
and O
cheap O
meal B-AS
. O

Be O
prepared O
to O
hear O
bad O
70s O
rock O
and O
80s O
pop B-AS
thumping O
downstairs O
while O
you O
eat O
, O
but O
the O
food B-AS
is O
shockingly O
good O
. O

GREAT O
APPETIZER B-AS
BEFORE O
THE O
BURGER B-AS
! O

The O
waiter B-AS
rushed O
us O
through O
the O
last O
half O
of O
our O
dinner B-AS
because O
they O
were O
turning O
the O
room O
into O
a O
dance O
floor O
. O

18 O
has O
a O
cozy O
romantic O
atmosphere B-AS
that O
' O
s O
very O
comfortable O
to O
enjoy O
myself O
in O
; O
whether O
I O
want O
to O
have O
a O
drink O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
or O
get O
together O
with O
a O
group O
of O
friends O
for O
dinner O
, O
suitable O
accomodations O
are O
available O
. O

We O
arrived O
on O
Tuesday O
( O
party O
of O
2 O
) O
at O
6 O
: O
55 O
sharp O
and O
the O
place B-AS
was O
empty O
, O
with O
just O
a O
few O
people O
sitting O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
. O

The O
hummus B-AS
was O
not O
flavorful O
and O
when O
we O
ran O
out O
of O
bread B-AS
and O
asked O
for O
more O
, O
it O
never O
came O
. O

The O
space B-AS
was O
unique O
( O
even O
though O
looking O
out O
the O
skylight B-AS
windows I-AS
on O
a O
tenament O
was O
a O
bit O
odd O
) O
and O
the O
service B-AS
, O
happily O
, O
was O
fine O
. O

My O
favorite O
foods B-AS
include O
the O
vegetable B-AS
spring I-AS
rolls I-AS
, O
Goong O
Gar O
Bog O
( O
shrimp O
appetizer O
) O
and O
Pad B-AS
Kimow I-AS
Gai O
or O
Goong O
. O

The O
advertised O
unlimited O
mimosas B-AS
and O
bloody O
marys O
is O
too O
good O
to O
be O
true O
until O
you O
realize O
that O
they O
keep O
down O
your O
drink O
count O
because O
the O
service B-AS
is O
so O
slow O
. O

After O
taking O
our O
orders O
, O
another O
person O
came O
to O
the O
table O
to O
announce O
the O
special B-AS
dishes I-AS
which O
the O
waiter B-AS
forgot O
prompting O
2 O
in O
our O
party O
to O
cancel O
the O
original O
orders O
in O
favor O
of O
the O
specials B-AS
. O

We O
were O
a O
party O
of O
four O
, O
and O
after O
a O
long O
wait B-AS
, O
were O
seated O
in O
a O
freezing O
corner B-AS
. O

They O
brought O
us O
one O
teacup O
sized O
bowl B-AS
of I-AS
chips I-AS
for O
the O
4 O
of O
us O
, O
which O
disappeared O
within O
minutes O
, O
and O
didn O
' O
t O
replenish O
our O
chips O
until O
an O
hour O
later O
- O
- O
after O
we O
finally O
got O
our O
food B-AS
and O
after O
we O
asked O
them O
for O
some O
more O
chips O
2 O
TIMES O
! O

Horrible O
service B-AS
, O
below O
average O
cuisine O
, O
asked O
to O
leave O
the O
table O
before O
finishing O
our O
wine B-AS
, O
and O
forced O
to O
have O
our O
port B-AS
at O
the O
bar O
. O

They O
' O
re O
just O
as O
fanatical O
about O
tlacoyos O
- O
- O
homemade O
half O
- O
moon O
corncakes O
stuffed O
with O
smoky O
pulled B-AS
chicken I-AS
tinga I-AS
- O
- O
and O
hot O
- O
pressed O
sandwiches B-AS
, O
like O
the O
Aztec B-AS
Hoggie O
with O
shredded O
guajillo O
- O
spiced O
pork B-AS
. O

I O
' O
ve O
been O
there O
for O
lunch B-AS
many O
times O
and O
the O
service B-AS
is O
always O
cheerful O
and O
efficient O
. O

We O
asked O
for O
a O
side B-AS
of I-AS
dressing I-AS
but O
the O
waiter B-AS
told O
us O
that O
all O
the O
salads B-AS
just O
had O
oil O
and O
vinegar O
so O
we O
should O
just O
use O
the O
oil O
and O
vinegar O
that O
was O
on O
the O
table O
. O

If O
you O
like O
deep O
dish B-AS
, O
you O
may O
be O
disappointed O
, O
as O
Grimaldi O
' O
s O
only O
does O
thin O
crust B-AS
, O
but O
if O
you O
want O
the O
best O
New B-AS
York I-AS
pizza I-AS
, O
come O
here O
. O

To O
elaborate O
; O
the O
menu B-AS
is O
written O
in O
French O
but O
the O
dishes B-AS
themselves O
are O
something O
that O
your O
- O
enthusiastic O
yet O
talentless O
boyfriend O
- O
might O
muster O
up O
for O
you O
, O
leaving O
you O
looking O
concerned O
for O
his O
love O
for O
you O
. O

) O
I O
' O
m O
sticking O
with O
Cafe B-AS
Mozart O
- O
- O
which O
has O
the O
same O
desserts B-AS
, O
bigger O
slices O
, O
and O
lower O
prices B-AS
! O

I O
was O
shocked O
to O
have O
gotten O
no O
apology O
from O
the O
management B-AS
, O
and O
to O
top O
it O
off O
were O
charged O
for O
the O
drinks B-AS
we O
had O
while O
patiently O
waiting B-AS
for O
food B-AS
that O
never O
arrived O
. O

The O
portions B-AS
were O
so O
big O
that O
after O
a O
cocktail B-AS
drink I-AS
we O
had O
no O
room O
left O
for O
desert O
. O

Try O
the O
Bangkok B-AS
fruit I-AS
punch I-AS
, O
or O
floating O
market B-AS
drinks I-AS
. O

We O
had O
the O
6 O
course O
tasting O
menu O
- O
the O
salad B-AS
and O
first O
course B-AS
pasta I-AS
was O
good O
; O
the O
gnocchi B-AS
was O
watery O
with O
a O
tasteless O
sauce B-AS
; O
then O
came O
out O
the O
entree B-AS
, O
a O
burnt O
cod B-AS
. O

The O
cool O
thing O
about O
the O
3 O
course B-AS
price I-AS
fix O
is O
that O
there O
is O
no O
special O
or O
limited O
menu B-AS
, O
you O
can O
order O
ANY O
app O
, O
ANY O
entree O
and O
ANY O
Dessert O
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
was O
just O
throwing O
our O
dishes B-AS
on O
the O
table B-AS
without O
even O
clearing O
the O
appetizer O
plates O
and O
then O
they O
started O
clearing O
the O
food B-AS
when O
we O
weren O
' O
t O
even O
finished O
yet O
. O

It O
' O
s O
interesting O
but O
after O
eating O
dinner O
here O
once O
the O
only O
thing O
I O
remember O
is O
that O
the O
bar B-AS
was O
nice O
, O
drinks O
expensive O
and O
food B-AS
was O
only O
average O
. O

The O
wine B-AS
cellar I-AS
was O
perfect O
for O
our O
group O
of O
10 O
for O
dinner B-AS
last O
week O
. O

We O
asked O
for O
the O
manager B-AS
who O
told O
us O
that O
it O
was O
their O
first O
time O
serving B-AS
brunch I-AS
, O
to O
be O
patient O
and O
that O
our O
bill O
would O
be O
discounted O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
after O
waiting B-AS
for O
an O
eternity O
to O
be O
seated O
, O
we O
finally O
sit O
down O
and O
wait O
for O
our O
menus B-AS
, O
wait O
for O
our O
food O
, O
and O
to O
our O
surprise O
the O
food O
was O
minimal O
relative O
to O
the O
price B-AS
. O

My O
dinner B-AS
started O
with O
a O
fish B-AS
soup I-AS
marseille I-AS
, O
which O
was O
devine O
. O

( O
Note O
: O
Price B-AS
variations O
were O
listed O
nowhere O
- O
- O
and O
I O
had O
asked O
for O
a O
to B-AS
- I-AS
go I-AS
drink I-AS
, O
deciding O
- O
- O
after O
paying O
- O
- O
to O
sit O
at O
a O
no O
- O
service O
counter O
until O
my O
drink O
cooled O
off O
. O

While O
the O
design O
of O
the O
space B-AS
and O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
quite O
enjoyable O
( O
with O
a O
great O
view O
of O
Union O
Square O
) O
, O
the O
food B-AS
has O
once O
again O
proved O
to O
be O
less O
than O
favorable O
and O
the O
service B-AS
mediocre O
. O

I O
came O
in O
for O
lunch B-AS
with O
some O
co O
- O
workers O
, O
and O
we O
had O
an O
amazing O
meal B-AS
for O
a O
bargain O
because O
they O
' O
ve O
extended O
the O
$ O
20 O
. O

I O
was O
their O
for O
Saturday B-AS
lunch I-AS
, O
adn O
I O
think O
that O
there O
' O
s O
a O
different O
dinner B-AS
menu I-AS
, O
but O
everything O
was O
great O
. O

If O
you O
go O
, O
you O
have O
to O
order O
the O
beef B-AS
ribs I-AS
for O
appetizer B-AS
, O
coconut O
char O
for O
entree O
and O
green O
donuts O
for O
dessert O
. O

The O
entertainment B-AS
is O
awesome O
- O
and O
believe O
it O
or O
not O
, O
I O
was O
so O
impressed O
with O
one O
of O
their O
musicians O
/ O
singers O
( O
named O
Alessandro O
) O
that O
I O
even O
had O
him O
play O
during O
my O
cocktail B-AS
hour I-AS
. O

Waiter B-AS
spilled O
a O
decent O
amount O
of O
water B-AS
on O
my O
friend O
' O
s O
plate O
- O
and O
then O
walked O
away O
- O
didn O
' O
t O
remove O
the O
plate O
! O

Food B-AS
was O
good O
but O
we O
were O
forgotten O
after O
we O
finished O
our O
entrees B-AS
. O

The O
first O
time O
around O
, O
we O
had O
the O
$ O
80 O
tasting O
menu B-AS
, O
which O
included O
some O
sushi O
items O
, O
which O
I O
found O
to O
be O
pretty O
average O
, O
especially O
for O
the O
price B-AS
. O

I O
can O
only O
speak O
as O
a O
non O
- O
Indian O
, O
since O
we O
both O
come O
from O
an O
originally O
American O
palate O
, O
but O
Indian B-AS
cuisine I-AS
, O
both O
Northern O
and O
Southern B-AS
, O
is O
my O
favorite O
non O
- O
Western O
cuisine O
, O
and O
I O
' O
m O
always O
on O
the O
prowl O
for O
something O
delicious O
and O
worth O
the O
price B-AS
. O

The O
waitress B-AS
was O
not O
very O
responsive O
to O
requests O
and O
was O
slow O
to O
return O
with O
drinks B-AS
. O

On O
another O
occasion O
, O
this O
same O
gentleman B-AS
brought O
bottled O
water B-AS
for O
our O
entire O
party O
[ O
4 O
] O
on O
the O
house O
again O
, O
when O
we O
missed O
our O
cab O
and O
asked O
to O
wait O
inside O
. O

The O
head B-AS
- I-AS
on I-AS
shrimps I-AS
with I-AS
anchovy I-AS
butter I-AS
had O
me O
licking O
the O
plate B-AS
. O

I O
had O
a O
side O
dish O
of O
pasta B-AS
and O
that O
was O
definitely O
the O
tastiest O
of O
the O
entrees B-AS
we O
ordered O
. O

Despite O
a O
lovely O
atmosphere B-AS
, O
this O
was O
perhaps O
the O
worst O
dining B-AS
experience O
I O
' O
ve O
had O
in O
New O
York O
. O

Although O
the O
restaurant O
was O
far O
from O
crowded O
( O
maybe O
three O
tables B-AS
) O
, O
service B-AS
was O
abysmally O
slow O
, O
to O
the O
point O
that O
we O
wondered O
if O
the O
server B-AS
was O
trying O
to O
avoid O
us O
. O

We O
objected O
at O
the O
ill O
flavor B-AS
of O
the O
drinks B-AS
and O
the O
manager B-AS
was O
not O
understanding O
at O
all O
. O

One O
person O
' O
s O
dinner B-AS
was O
cold O
, O
another O
was O
charged O
for O
a O
larger O
portion B-AS
than O
ordered O
, O
and O
my O
shrimp B-AS
pasta I-AS
was O
inedible O
. O

The O
mole O
sauce O
is O
not O
too O
sweet O
and O
adds O
a O
nice O
flavor B-AS
to O
the O
otherwise O
bland O
chicken B-AS
. O

Again O
, O
since O
I O
go O
out O
to O
dinner B-AS
several O
times O
a O
week O
in O
NY O
, O
I O
am O
used O
to O
paying O
high O
prices B-AS
and O
do O
not O
mind O
at O
all O
. O

I O
went O
back O
( O
with O
my O
cold O
soups B-AS
) O
They O
said O
they O
would O
have O
to O
make O
me O
another O
dish O
since O
they O
couldn O
' O
t O
scrape O
off O
the O
unwanted O
ingredients B-AS
. O

But O
Bobby O
Flay O
really O
steps O
up O
at O
Bar B-AS
Americain O
- O
- O
his O
passion O
and O
heart O
shine O
through O
the O
food B-AS
. O

You O
have O
to O
wait B-AS
in O
line O
most O
of O
the O
time O
, O
but O
the O
burgers B-AS
are O
worth O
it O
and O
the O
beer B-AS
is O
cheap O
. O

Like O
the O
other O
reviewer O
said O
, O
have O
a O
Mojito B-AS
and O
enjoy O
the O
sugarcane B-AS
. O

Only O
reason O
to O
go O
is O
Eben O
, O
the O
most O
solicitious O
bartender B-AS
in O
NYC O
( O
now O
) O
with O
drink B-AS
knowledge O
and O
ability O
to O
spare O
. O

Don O
' O
t O
ask O
for O
a O
menu O
- O
take O
the O
trip O
with O
your O
waiter B-AS
who O
eloquently O
( O
and O
vividly O
) O
describes O
dishes B-AS
until O
he O
sees O
your O
eyes O
light O
up O
. O

A O
terrific O
place B-AS
to O
eat O
breakfast O
, O
lunch B-AS
or O
dinner B-AS
. O

The O
Food B-AS
The O
secret O
to O
Nick O
' O
s O
pizza B-AS
is O
the O
sublime O
crust B-AS
, O
which O
arrives O
caked O
in O
soot O
. O

Kids O
love O
the O
tabletop O
crayons O
and O
coloring O
books O
, O
but O
the O
real O
crowd O
- O
pleaser O
is O
raw O
pizza B-AS
dough I-AS
- O
- O
lumps O
are O
available O
at O
the O
open O
kitchen B-AS
window O
. O

I O
thought O
I O
' O
d O
give O
the O
new B-AS
place I-AS
a O
try O
since O
it O
had O
an O
expanded O
menu B-AS
and O
a O
more O
legit O
look O
. O

Food O
is O
fine O
but O
unremarkable O
, O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
very O
noisy O
, O
especially O
for O
a O
date O
, O
and O
our O
waiter B-AS
looked O
like O
he O
had O
never O
seen O
us O
before O
when O
we O
reminded O
him O
that O
we O
had O
ordered O
a O
second O
round O
of O
drinks B-AS
20 O
minutes O
earlier O
. O

The O
host B-AS
was O
aloof O
; O
my O
waitress B-AS
, O
though O
sweet O
, O
didn O
' O
t O
seem O
to O
know O
the O
food O
or O
the O
menu B-AS
very O
well O
; O
and O
the O
waiter B-AS
we O
flagged O
over O
to O
order O
our O
wine O
seemed O
as O
if O
he O
had O
never O
looked O
at O
the O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
before O
. O

really O
bad O
service B-AS
took O
half O
an O
hour O
just O
to O
get O
a O
drink B-AS
. O

I O
went O
there O
for O
lunch B-AS
and O
brunch B-AS
and O
both O
times O
had O
a O
very O
good O
meal B-AS
. O

For O
a O
restaurant O
with O
such O
limited O
menu B-AS
and O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
, O
each O
dish B-AS
should O
better O
be O
darn O
good O
. O

Babbo O
and O
Lupa O
are O
significantly O
better O
, O
and O
this O
place O
should O
redo O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
or O
empty O
seats B-AS
could O
become O
the O
norm O
. O

I O
especially O
love O
the O
korean B-AS
dish I-AS
' O
s O
they O
add O
into O
there O
menu B-AS
consider O
its O
2 O
for O
1 O
its O
hard O
not O
to O
resist O
with O
asian O
cuisine O
being O
so O
expensive O
in O
all O
in O
New O
York O
. O

although O
the O
food B-AS
was O
good O
, O
the O
wait O
was O
so O
long O
; O
extremely O
snobby O
about O
seating B-AS
you O
, O
we O
waited O
45 O
min O
+ O
for O
our O
reservation O
. O

I O
sat O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
to O
receive O
faster O
service B-AS
, O
and O
boy O
was O
i O
wrong O
! O

the O
variety B-AS
of I-AS
fish I-AS
wasnt O
bad O
and O
all O
the O
usual O
suspects O
( O
salmon O
, O
tuna O
, O
yellowtail B-AS
, O
squid B-AS
, O
octopus O
, O
etc O
) O
were O
present O
. O

$ O
25 O
prix B-AS
fixe I-AS
sounds O
like O
a O
good O
deal O
, O
but O
dinner O
was O
still O
$ O
100 O
for O
two O
, O
the O
portions B-AS
were O
small O
, O
and O
the O
( O
$ O
35 O
) O
wine B-AS
, O
clearly O
where O
the O
money B-AS
is O
made O
, O
mediocre O
. O

Reasonable O
prices B-AS
for O
Cuban B-AS
food I-AS
in O
the O
city O
. O

Having O
heard O
that O
the O
steakhouse O
had O
a O
tendency O
to O
overcook O
the O
steaks B-AS
, O
I O
asked O
the O
waitress B-AS
that O
she O
ask O
the O
chef B-AS
to O
prepare O
it O
closer O
to O
rare O
than O
medium O
. O

The O
food B-AS
here O
is O
consistently O
good O
- O
the O
service B-AS
is O
not O
- O
but O
it O
seems O
that O
they O
' O
re O
getting O
busier O
than O
they O
can O
handle O
, O
good O
for O
them O
, O
bad O
for O
guests O
. O

The O
table O
next O
to O
us O
had O
hummus B-AS
which O
looked O
delicious O
, O
so O
we O
really O
should O
have O
stuck O
to O
appetizers B-AS
and O
wine B-AS
. O

I O
drop O
by O
to O
Cascina O
most O
often O
for O
lunch B-AS
with O
co O
- O
workers O
for O
great O
pizza B-AS
. O

After O
dinner B-AS
I O
walked O
over O
to O
the O
cheese B-AS
counter I-AS
- O
after O
having O
been O
greeted O
by O
a O
rude O
server B-AS
, O
I O
was O
shocked O
to O
see O
how O
dissapointing O
their O
cheese O
selection O
was O
: O
it O
is O
miniscule O
, O
many O
of O
the O
fresh O
chevre O
cheese O
were O
more O
than O
ready O
to O
be O
tossed O
, O
etc O
. O

We O
were O
so O
irritated O
about O
how O
horrible O
the O
food B-AS
was O
, O
we O
didn O
' O
t O
stick O
around O
to O
hangout O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
. O

It O
would O
have O
been O
nice O
to O
find O
that O
out O
on O
the O
website O
but O
it O
took O
us O
an O
hour O
of O
waiting B-AS
for O
Godot O
before O
calling O
and O
being O
told O
the O
news O
that O
no O
lunch B-AS
was O
prepared O
for O
us O
. O

Though O
the O
menu B-AS
is O
brief O
, O
entrees B-AS
range O
from O
a O
deeply O
satisfying O
, O
wintry O
seared O
calf O
' O
s O
liver O
with O
oven O
- O
dried O
tomatoes O
to O
a O
much O
lighter O
striped B-AS
bass I-AS
drizzled O
with O
textbook O
perfect O
beurre O
blanc O
. O

Our O
meal B-AS
was O
interrupted O
several O
times O
by O
the O
arguments O
between O
our O
waiter B-AS
and O
the O
maitre B-AS
' O
d O
. O

Our O
waiter B-AS
forgot O
about O
us O
for O
long O
periods O
of O
time O
and O
never O
even O
offered O
us O
a O
dessert B-AS
menu I-AS
. O

Food B-AS
was O
good O
, O
but O
for O
the O
price O
of O
a O
plate B-AS
of O
pasta B-AS
here O
, O
four O
raviolis O
doesn O
' O
t O
cut O
it O
as O
an O
entre O
for O
a O
big O
guy B-AS
. O

I O
particularly O
like O
the O
side B-AS
dishes I-AS
- O
- O
the O
eggplant B-AS
dip I-AS
, O
for O
example O
- O
- O
and O
the O
appetizers B-AS
. O

The O
Scene B-AS
The O
consistent O
lines O
at O
this O
bustling O
Japanese O
tapas O
hot O
spot O
don O
' O
t O
lie O
: O
Yokocho O

reasonably O
priced B-AS
comfort I-AS
food I-AS
and O
social O
atmosphere B-AS
draw O
a O
youthful O
clientele O
of O
cultural O
natives O
and O
gaijin O
alike O
. O

For O
dessert B-AS
we O
split O
the O
combination O
platter B-AS
, O
which O
had O
rather O
small O
portions B-AS
but O
they O
were O
good O
. O

I O
used O
to O
love O
the O
Dog B-AS
but O
now O
its O
become O
a O
metling O
pot B-AS
of O
really O
undesirable O
people O
. O

Since O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
, O
we O
decided O
to O
get O
a O
drink O
but O
the O
bartender B-AS
ignored O
us O
even O
when O
we O
made O
it O
known O
that O
we O
would O
like O
to O
order O
a O
drinks B-AS
. O

We O
asked O
the O
server B-AS
for O
two O
glasses O
with O
a O
splash O
of O
Southern B-AS
Comfort I-AS
and O
Grand O
Marnier O
. O

Get O
there O
before O
7 O
: O
30 O
for O
dinner B-AS
or O
get O
ready O
for O
a O
really O
long O
wait B-AS
- O
this O
place O
doesn O
' O
t O
take O
reservations O
. O

The O
waitress B-AS
was O
kind O
and O
helpfull O
with O
the O
menu B-AS
. O

For O
instance O
, O
the O
Spicy B-AS
Potatoes I-AS
were O
merly O
home O
fries B-AS
with I-AS
Red I-AS
Hot I-AS
sauce I-AS
on O
them O
. O

The O
best O
aspect O
of O
Dylan O
Prime O
is O
that O
it O
' O
s O
a O
perfect O
spot B-AS
for O
a O
first O
date O
, O
a O
business B-AS
dinner I-AS
, O
a O
casual O
night O
- O
on O
- O
the O
- O
town O
or O
even O
just O
a O
quite O
bite O
at O
lunch B-AS
. O

AND O
, O
the O
waitstaff B-AS
likes O
to O
lick O
its O
fingers O
when O
cutting O
cakes O
/ O
pies O
and O
serves O
hot O
and O
cold O
drinks B-AS
by O
holding O
the O
glass B-AS
or O
cup O
around O
the O
brim O

top O
. O

- O
the O
bread B-AS
served I-AS
was O
cold O
- O
the O
choices O
for O
restaurant O
week O
was O
very O
slim O
( O
no O
meat B-AS

except O
pork O
) O
- O
there O
were O
no O
chef B-AS

the O

not O
up O

the O
quality O
expected O
There O
are O
more O
exciting O
, O
romantic O
restaurants O
in O
the O
city O
to O
visit O
. O

The O
manager B-AS
, O
typical O
machissimo O
italian O
businessman O
, O
sat O
outside O
with O
his O
chef B-AS
scowling O
and O
smoking O
- O
- O
an O
uncomfortable O
dining B-AS
experience I-AS
. O

Great O
hamburgers O
, O
but O
the O
Corner B-AS
Bistro I-AS
has O
the O
worst O
service B-AS
of O
any O
food B-AS
establishment O
I O
' O
ve O
ever O
been O
to O
. O

Diver O
scallops B-AS
were O
divine O
along O
with O
chilled B-AS
beets I-AS
or O
high O
volocety B-AS
pasta I-AS
. O

I O
waited O
10 O
minutes O
to O
get O
change O
for O
a O
drink O
I O
ordered O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
, O
my O
friend O
had O
one O
of O
her O
drinks B-AS
dumped O
all O
over O
the O
floor O
by O
the O
same O
waitress B-AS
above O
who O
took O
too O
long O
to O
get O
me O
my O
change O
, O
and O
it O
took O
forever O
for O
that O
much O
to O
happen O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
ok O
, O
typical O
for O
the O
chain O
, O
a O
good O
place O
to O
stop O
for O
a O
lunch B-AS
. O

The O
hostess B-AS
SLOWLY O
walked O
by O
our O
table B-AS
scribbing O
something O
on O
paper O
. O

The O
tables B-AS
are O
too O
close O
together O
and O
it O
' O
s O
awkward O
to O
get O
up O
and O
down O
without O
disturbing O
the O
folks O
next O
to O
you O
, O
but O
the O
food B-AS
is O
still O
the O
best O
around O
. O

I O
have O
never O
been O
treated O
more O
rudely O
than O
I O
was O
by O
the O
hostess O
and O
the O
manager B-AS
of O
Public O
for O
brunch B-AS
last O
Sunday O
; O
the O
hostess O
was O
arrogant O
, O
despicable O
, O
and O
mean O
to O
our O
party O
( O
reminder O
: O
she O
is O
a O
hostess O
in O
the O
service B-AS
industry O
) O
. O

They O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
beautiful O
clientele B-AS

gay O
and O
straight O
, O
plus O
you O

The O
Food B-AS
The O
menu B-AS
ably O
pulls O
off O
Bistro O
101 O
: O
The O
generous O
cheese B-AS
plate I-AS
makes O
a O
big O
enough O
starter B-AS
for O
at O
least O
three O
people O
to O
share O
, O
and O
French B-AS
onion I-AS
soup I-AS
is O
rich O
and O
decadent O
. O

Upon O
entering O
we O
were O
promptly O
seated O
and O
ordered O
a O
few O
minutes O
after O
ordering O
the O
waiter B-AS
came O
out O
and O
said O
they O
are O
completely O
out O
of O
crab O
, O
crab B-AS
legs I-AS
, O
crab O
claws O
everything O
. O

Food B-AS
was O
blend O
and O
overcooked O
and O
the O
waitress B-AS
kept O
on O
coming O
over O
every O
10 O
minutes O
to O
ask O
whether O
if O
things O
were O
ok O
, O
do O
we O
want O
to O
refill O
drinks B-AS
( O
when O
my O
drink O
was O
half O
full O
! O
! O

Yes O
the O
wait B-AS
is O
dreafully O
long O
, O
the O
place O
feels O
a O
bit O
uncomfortable O
to O
talk O
in O
with O
your O
dining B-AS
partner O
, O
but O
the O
food B-AS
is O
excellent O
none O
the O
less O
. O

Server B-AS
was O
nonexistent O
; O
when O
we O
flagged O
her O
down O
, O
she O
told O
us O
that O
the O
food B-AS
was O
' O
being O
plated O
' O
when O
clearly O
they O
were O
just O
starting O
to O
prepare O
it O
. O

For O
$ O
13 O
you O
receive O
2 O
entrees B-AS
, O
soup B-AS
, O
rice O
, O
salad B-AS
, O
maki O
roll B-AS
, O
and O
small O
dessert B-AS
. O

When O
a O
seemly O
accommodating O
Le O
Souk O
manager B-AS
assured O
you O
that O
he O
had O
no O
problem O
serving O
a O
group O
of O
twenty O
on O
a O
Saturday O
evening O
, O
I O
expected O
him O
to O
keep O
his O
words O
or O
shall O
I O
say O
our O
table B-AS
. O

We O
both O
orderd O
drinks B-AS
that O
we O
never O
recived O
, O
but O
were O
charged O
for O
, O
and O
when O
we O
said O
something O
to O
the O
waiter B-AS
he O
rolled O
his O
eyes O
and O
asked O
if O
we O
wanted O
them O
anyway O
( O
after O
we O
were O
done O
eating O
and O
more O
than O
ready O
to O
go O
. O

This O
place O
is O
pricey O
, O
and O
yes O
, O
the O
food B-AS
is O
worth O
it O
; O
but O
the O
service B-AS
makes O
you O
feel O
like O
you O
should O
be O
paying O
a O
quater O
of O
the O
price O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
good O
, O
but O
not O
excellent O
; O
however O
, O
the O
waiter B-AS
was O
initially O
huffy O
with O
me O
when O
my O
guest O
was O
only O
5 O
minutes O
late O
, O
threatening O
to O
make O
me O
move O
! O

Mixed B-AS
drinks I-AS
were O
bad O
, O
had O
to O
switch O
to O
beer B-AS
. O

The O
choices B-AS
for O
vegetarians O
are O
extremely O
limited O
, O
unless O
one O
is O
content O
with O
side O
dishes B-AS
. O

food B-AS
arrived O
quickly O
and O
was O
hot O
and O
v O
good O
, O
just O
don O
' O
t O
be O
on O
a O
diet O
if O
you O
are O
going O
to O
eat O
here O
as O
no O
real O
options B-AS
for O
slimmers O
! O
! O

no O
dish O
on O
brunch B-AS
menu I-AS
over O
$ O
11 O
- O
definitely O
worth O
the O
price B-AS
. O

Would O
go O
back O
when O
I O
was O
ordering O
off O
the O
regular O
menu B-AS
and O
give O
the O
steak B-AS
a O
try O
. O

and O
salads B-AS
( O
try O
mixed B-AS
green I-AS
with I-AS
mozzarella I-AS
or O
chicken B-AS
) O
. O

Because O
our O
daughters O
weren O
' O
t O
sure O
what O
to O
order O
, O
and O
were O
a O
little O
intimidated O
at O
the O
surroundings O
( O
notwithstanding O
the O
beautiful O
simplicity O
of O
the O
decor B-AS
) O
, O
they O
ordered O
only O
appetizers B-AS
while O
their O
fathers O
ordered O
dinner B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
OK O
, O
but O
I O
could O
have O
had O
pasta B-AS
with I-AS
tomatoes I-AS
anywhere I-AS
. O

My O
last O
day O
visiting O
NYC O
, O
I O
went O
last O
night O
to O
great O
Thai B-AS
food I-AS
( O
Tiny O
Thai O
) O
and O
today O
I O
had O
lunch B-AS
at O
the O
unique O
sushi B-AS
samba O
restaurant O
. O

It O
' O
s O
very O
reasonably O
priced B-AS
considering O
the O
size O
of O
portions B-AS
. O

Waitstaff B-AS
is O
preoccupied O
dancing O
on O
the O
bar B-AS
and O
googling O
at O
beautiful O
people O
, O
but O
who O
can O
blame O
them O
. O

the O
quantity B-AS
of I-AS
food I-AS
was O
a O
good O
size O
with O
tons O
of O
shrimp B-AS
in O
our O
noodle B-AS
dish I-AS
. O

One O
example O
, O
I O
ordered O
an O
appetizer B-AS
that O
was O
not O
prepared O
as O
the O
menu B-AS
stated O
and O
had O
to O
argue O
with O
waitress B-AS
to O
get O
it O
fixed O
. O

After O
ordering O
a O
couple O
beers O
from O
the O
pleasant O
bartender B-AS
, O
my O
date O
and O
I O
took O
a O
seat B-AS
at O
one O
of O
MANY O
vacant O
tables O
next O
to O
the O
bar O
( O
The O
bar B-AS
stools I-AS
were O
full O
) O
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
it O
was O
a O
decent O
meal B-AS
but O
dinner B-AS
for O
two O
came O
to O
$ O
172 O
with O
tip B-AS
. O

Very O
claustrophobic O
place B-AS
so O
expect O
it O
to O
be O
really O
crowded O
during O
lunch B-AS
. O

Ignoring O
the O
plain O
decor B-AS
, O
Jo O
- O
An O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
options O
for O
cheap O
japanese B-AS
food I-AS
on O
the O
Upper O
West O
Side O
. O

When O
we O
got O
our O
food B-AS
, O
the O
waitress B-AS
barely O
said O
a O
word O
as O
she O
placed O
our O
take B-AS
- I-AS
out I-AS
on O
the O
table O
and O
grabbed O
the O
check B-AS
. O

Good O
food B-AS
, O
even O
if O
it O
' O
s O
inauthentic O
Thai B-AS
. O

He O
met O
me O
for O
wine O
tasting O
/ O
sampling O
of O
food B-AS
the O
week O
before O
and O
made O
sure O
that O
the O
service B-AS
was O
on O
their O
toes O
. O

What O
I O
don O
' O
t O
get O
is O
asking O
a O
high O
rolling O
, O
forgiving O
of O
bad O
service B-AS
, O
drink O
guzzling O
table O
like O
mine O
to O
leave O
as O
soon O
as O
we O
finished O
out O
last O
sip O
of O
$ O
12 O
martinis B-AS
and O
left O
a O
25 O
% O
tip O
. O

We O
had O
a O
reservation B-AS
for O
Monday O
lunch B-AS
and O
were O
seated B-AS
promptly O
, O
which O
was O
a O
pleasant O
surprise O
. O

My O
only O
complaint O
might O
be O
the O
beer B-AS
selection I-AS
- O
they O
didn O
' O
t O
really O
have O
any O
dark O
beers O
, O
which O
I O
like O
to O
have O
with O
a O
steak B-AS
. O

Aside O
from O
that O
, O
the O
service B-AS
is O
adequate O
( O
visible O
, O
and O
will O
help O
you O
if O
you O
ask O
, O
but O
lack O
initiative O
) O
, O
and O
the O
food B-AS
, O
well O
, O
could O
be O
a O
lot O
worse O
. O

The O
lemon B-AS
goat I-AS
cheesecake I-AS
was O
extremely O
dry O
and O
practically O
begged O
for O
a O
nice O
sauce B-AS
or O
some O
fresh O
fruit B-AS
. O

Our O
waiter B-AS
ask O
us O
what O
kind O
of O
soufle O
we O
wanted O
and O
told O
us O
to O
get O
2 O
, O
making O
us O
believe O
that O
it O
was O
part O
of O
the O
pre B-AS
- I-AS
fixe I-AS
, O
nope O
soufles O
are O
seperate O
and O
we O
were O
so O
full O
from O
dinner B-AS
we O
could O
barely O
finish O
one O
. O

Not O
very O
crowded O
, O
the O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
seemed O
to O
be O
in O
full O
force O
except O
when O
you O
needed O
their O
attention O
for O
something O
like O
water O
or O
tea B-AS
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
was O
miffed O
when O
we O
decided O
to O
order O
dessert B-AS
( O
and O
I O
must O
say O
we O
were O
eating O
the O
courses B-AS
as O
they O
arrived O
, O
no O
lingering O
) O
. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
the O
meal B-AS
the O
waitress B-AS
asked O
if O
we O
wanted O
another O
drink B-AS
, O
the O
after O
agreeing O
to O
have O
one O
she O
stated O
, O
actually O
there O
' O
s O
a O
list O
of O
people B-AS
waiting I-AS
, O
can O
you O
go O
next O
door O
to O
the O
bar O
. O

I O
even O
had O
a O
waiter B-AS
who O
was O
carrying O
a O
tray O
of O
beers B-AS
actually O
TELL O
me O
to O
get O
out O
of O
the O
way O
as O
I O
was O
making O
my O
way O
towards O
the O
door O
. O

Hey O
- O
What O
better O
excuse O
to O
sit O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
and O
try O
another O
one O
of O
their O
fantastic O
drinks B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
unremarkable O
: O
generally O
good O
, O
but O
lacking O
the O
spice B-AS
and O
flair O
of O
more O
memorable O
cuban O
/ O
latin O
cuisine B-AS
. O

Nothing O
beats O
being O
served B-AS
platters I-AS
of I-AS
shrimp I-AS
and O
wings B-AS
and O
pitchers O
of O
beer B-AS
, O
by O
the O
HOTTEST O
waitstaff B-AS
in O
NY O
! O
! O
! O
! O

Limited O
menu B-AS
but O
for O
STEAK B-AS
, O
, O
, O
and O
giant O
onion O
and O
tomato O
salad O
. O

I O
agree O
with O
the O
other O
poster O
who O
wrote O
about O
the O
service B-AS
: O
the O
waiter O
challenged O
every O
single O
dish B-AS
we O
ordered O
with O
a O
special B-AS
( O
I O
' O
ve O
never O
had O
a O
more O
money O
hungry O
waiter O
) O
and O
after O
waiting B-AS
20 O
minutes O
for O
the O
check O
we O
had O
to O
call O
the O
manager B-AS
over O
; O
who O
was O
unapologetic O
. O

After O
we O
in O
fact O
moved O
to O
the O
bar B-AS
, O
and O
I O
told O
the O
waitress B-AS
which O
bottle O
we O
wanted O
- O
the O
one O
we O
had O
been O
drinking O
- O
we O
were O
told O
we O
had O
to O
order O
off O
the O
limited O
daily O
specials O
list O
. O

We O
arrived O
on O
a O
Thursday O
night O
at O
6 O
: O
30 O
and O
were O
seated O
immediately O
( O
they O
don O
' O
t O
take O
reservations B-AS
) O
, O
but O
, O
this O
small O
place B-AS
filled O
up O
very O
quickly O
, O
and O
the O
bar B-AS
was O
overflowing O
with O
people O
when O
we O
left O
. O

Some O
of O
the O
waiters B-AS
are O
lacking O
good O
communication O
skills O
, O
but O
that O
can O
be O
overlooked O
in O
light O
of O
the O
great O
food B-AS
and O
prices O
. O

I O
just O
had O
dinner B-AS
there O
with O
my O
girlfriend O
and O
we O
had O
the O
best O
time B-AS
. O

The O
wait B-AS
was O
much O
shorter O
than O
the O
hostess B-AS
quoted O
, O
which O
was O
great O
. O

One O
waitress B-AS
was O
downright O
rude O
when O
we O
asked O
for O
the O
check B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
good O
I O
had O
the O
ground B-AS
beef I-AS
over O
rice B-AS
. O

Come O
in O
the O
evening O
, O
sip O
a O
glass O
of O
wine O
, O
or O
two O
, O
and O
enjoy O
the O
great O
live B-AS
jazz I-AS
along O
with O
your O
dinner B-AS
. O

not O
only O
did O
we O
not O
get O
our O
' O
bombay O
' O
fries O
until O
after O
the O
entire O
meal B-AS
, O
but O
we O
then O
had O
to O
wait O
nearly O
an O
hour O
for O
our O
inattentive O
waiter B-AS
to O
bring O
our O
check O
, O
and O
only O
after O
we O
flagged O
him O
down O
. O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
sat O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
, O
and O
service B-AS
was O
excellent O
. O

The O
hostess B-AS
failed O
to O
inform O
us O
of O
that O
the O
restuarnt O
was O
hosting O
a O
private O
company O
party O
when O
we O
made O
the O
reservation B-AS
. O

For O
dessert B-AS
the O
pecan B-AS
pie I-AS
, O
comes O
warm O
with O
whip O
cream B-AS
. O

One O
friend O
had O
the O
steak B-AS
which O
he O
didn O
' O
t O
care O
for O
, O
but O
after O
waiting B-AS
so O
long O
to O
be O
seated O
he O
was O
hungry O
. O

although O
I O
don O
' O
t O
think O
there O
is O
any O
beef O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
( O
but O
there O
is O
plenty O
of O
fish B-AS
and O
chicken O
) O
. O

The O
new B-AS
fall I-AS
menu I-AS
has O
a O
black B-AS
cod I-AS
with I-AS
miso I-AS
broth I-AS
so O
good O
I O
thought O
I O
was O
at O
Nobu O
. O

Be O
prepared O
to O
make O
friends O
with O
the O
people B-AS
sitting O
next O
to O
you O
, O
tight O
seating B-AS
. O

I O
drank O
beer B-AS
, O
but O
I O
tried O
her O
apple B-AS
martini I-AS
, O
It O
was O
great O
not O
sour O
at O
all O
. O

Despite O
the O
fact O
that O
I O
had O
called O
earlier O
in O
the O
day O
and O
was O
told O
that O
the O
place O
didn O
' O
t O
take O
reservations B-AS
and O
there O
were O
several O
empty O
tables B-AS
for O
two O
on O
both O
floors O
, O
we O
were O
told O
that O
there O
would O
be O
a O
30 O
minute O
wait B-AS
. O

The O
menu B-AS
has O
many O
dishes B-AS
that O
one O
can O
' O
t O
find O
anywhere O
in O
the O
city O
. O

The O
rolls B-AS
are O
tiny O
so O
you O
have O
to O
order O
more O
anyway O
and O
they O
will O
often O
get O
your O
order O
wrong O
if O
you O
stray O
from O
the O
menu B-AS
. O

After O
scrunching O
into O
the O
tiny O
bar O
area O
and O
ordering O
a O
drink B-AS
, O
I O
was O
annoyed O
but O
couldn O
' O
t O
help O
but O
notice O
the O
handsome O
bartender B-AS
having O
a O
tete O
- O
a O
- O
tete O
with O
another O
French O
- O
speaking O
cutie O
. O

Overall O
, O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
food O
won O
us O
over O
, O
but O
if O
there O
' O
s O
one O
thing O
the O
management B-AS
needs O
to O
work O
on O
, O
it O
' O
s O
service B-AS
. O

I O
would O
definitely O
recommend O
getting O
reservations B-AS
as O
the O
wait B-AS
can O
be O
very O
long O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
fine O
and O
the O
food B-AS
delivered O
in O
reasonable O
time O
given O
the O
crowd B-AS
, O
but O
for O
the O
price B-AS
I O
was O
disappointed O
. O

Once O
in O
the O
oven O
( O
electric O
, O
mind O
you O
) O
, O
he O
shifts O
pies B-AS
every O
few O
seconds O
to O
attain O
nicely O
- O
charred O
, O
chewy O
crust O
perfection B-AS
. O

I O
' O
ve O
never O
been O
during O
the O
dinner B-AS
rush O
, O
whence O
I O
think O
most O
of O
the O
service B-AS
complaints O
originate O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
manager B-AS
refused O
to O
come O
over O
to O
apologize O
- O
but O
told O
the O
waitress B-AS
to O
offer O
us O
TWO O
desserts B-AS
on O
the O
house O
- O
when O
there O
were O
FOUR O
people O
dining B-AS
. O

It O
took O
the O
waiter B-AS
over O
30 O
minutes O
to O
get O
our O
food B-AS
because O
the O
order O
was O
misplaced O
. O

So O
maybe O
I O
' O
m O
naive O
to O
the O
latest O
trends B-AS
in O
dining B-AS
, O
but O
I O
really O
didn O
' O
t O
like O
it O
. O

The O
retaurant O
is O
know O
for O
the O
long O
wait B-AS
but O
they O
do O
take O
reservation B-AS
for O
group O
of O
5 O
- O
8 O
people O
, O
so O
it O
was O
just O
perfect O
for O
my O
friend O
BD O
dinner B-AS
for O
3 O
couples O
. O

The O
food O
is O
fantastic O
, O
Gourmet B-AS
comfort I-AS
food I-AS
and O
has O
gotten O
progressively O
better O
over O
the O
past O
year O
, O
as O
did O
the O
service B-AS
. O

The O
chorizo B-AS
was O
a O
memory O
and O
sounded O
better O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
. O

At O
one O
point O
, O
I O
spilled O
my O
water B-AS
glass I-AS
- O
- O
when O
I O
informed O
the O
waiter B-AS
of O
this O
he O
said O
he O
would O
clean O
it O
up O
- O
- O
he O
never O
got O
around O
to O
it O
. O

The O
service B-AS
is O
great O
- O
they O
are O
very O
attentive O
and O
fast O
, O
however O
, O
they O
do O
make O
faces O
and O
comments O
when O
you O
order O
alot O
of O
the O
ALL O
YOU O
CAN O
EAT O
food B-AS
. O

the O
waitress B-AS
was O
slow O
and O
forgot O
our O
drinks B-AS
about O
3 O
times O
. O

the O
duck B-AS
is O
not O
freshly O
roasted O
, O
it O
has O
been O
sitting O
under O
the O
IR O
lamp B-AS
for O
hours O
, O
skin O
is O
not O
crispy O
. O

After O
the O
wonderful O
anipasto B-AS
tray O
came O
, O
it O
was O
60 O
minutes O
before O
our O
plates B-AS
were O
removed O
and O
dinner B-AS
was O
brought O
. O

5 O
minutes O
later O
the O
same O
waitress B-AS
came O
back O
to O
have O
us O
move O
to O
the O
next O
table B-AS
so O
she O
could O
seat O
a O
party O
of O
4 O
. O

The O
wasabi B-AS
mashed I-AS
potatoes I-AS
were O
delicious O
while O
the O
chicken B-AS
was O
dry O
. O

Arriba O
Arriba O
has O
much O
better O
food B-AS
, O
margs O
, O
and O
atmosphere O
with O
slightly O
higher O
prices B-AS
, O
but O
well O
worth O
it O
. O

I O
agree O
with O
the O
many O
posters O
addressing O
an O
oppressively O
aggressive O
waitstaff B-AS
, O
and O
I O
' O
m O
in O
particular O
support O
of O
the O
review O
directed O
at O
Franny O
' O
s O
bizarrely O
adamant O
refusal O
to O
cut O
pizza B-AS
( O
or O
provide O
adaquate B-AS
knives O
/ O
plates O
for O
us O
to O
do O
it O
ourselves O
) O
. O

The O
tables B-AS
are O
a O
little O
too O
close O
together O
, O
but O
when O
the O
food B-AS
is O
this O
good O
it O
' O
s O
difficult O
to O
be O
distracted O
. O

The O
ambiance B-AS
is O
nice O
, O
but O
the O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
was O
rude O
and O
unattentive O
. O

The O
clean O
, O
sunny O
interior B-AS
looks O
nothing O
like O
Jerry O
and O
the O
gang O
' O
s O
dingy O
haunt O
, O
but O
it O
showcases O
fun O
ephemera O
like O
Seinfeld B-AS
cast O
autographs O
and O
press O
clips O
on O
how O
the O
diner O
inspired O
the O
musical O
ode O

Suzanne O
Vega O

I O
' O

such O
wonderful O
things O
about O

the O

service B-AS
is O
quick O
, O
not O
overly O
friendly O
, O
but O
hey O
it O
' O
s O
a O
small O
place O
and O
the O
servers B-AS
are O
constantly O
busy O
. O

Their O
service B-AS
can O
use O
a O
little O
assistance O
, O
but O
their O
food B-AS
is O
great O
. O

Food B-AS
was O
at O
best O
, O
mediocre O
and O
when O
the O
bill B-AS
finally O
came O
they O
had O
nerve O
to O
add O
on O
20 O
% O
gratuity O
even O
though O
there O
was O
nothing O
stated O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
or O
anywhere O
that O
gratuity O
was O
included O
for O
a O
party O
of O
5 O
( O
usually O
a O
party O
of O
6 O
is O
gratuity O
inclusive O
) O
. O

Costs O
could O
be O
better O
- O
expect O
to O
be O
upsold O
by O
the O
hovering B-AS
wait I-AS
staff I-AS
- O
and O
come O
for O
the O
authentic O
tastes O
, O
not O
the O
interior B-AS
decor I-AS
( O
looked O
a O
littel O
like O
Cheers O
! O

The O
price B-AS
was O
right O
too O
- O
- O
I O
spent O
under O
$ O
30 O
for O
my O
entree O
and O
two O
drinks B-AS
. O

I O
don O
' O
t O
think O
the O
menu B-AS
is O
particularly O
creative O
, O
but O
I O
' O
ve O
gotten O
solidly O
tasty O
sushi B-AS
here O
and O
it O
' O
s O
always O
enormous O
. O

I O
STRONGLY O
recommend O
to O
try O
something O
other O
than O
typical O
menu B-AS
items O
and O
go O
for O
the O
short O
ribs B-AS
over O
rice B-AS
, O
black B-AS
cod I-AS
, O
sea B-AS
bass I-AS
, O
or O
duck B-AS
( O
there O
are O
two O
dishes B-AS
that O
are O
great O
) O
. O

As O
we O
attempted O
to O
digest O
our O
meal B-AS
and O
browse O
the O
dessert B-AS
menu I-AS
, O
the O
same O
staff B-AS
members I-AS
approached O
us O
to O
move O
along O
our O
order O
. O

While O
we O
were O
trying O
to O
have O
dinner B-AS
, O
all O
of O
the O
waiters B-AS
spent O
their O
time O
playing O
with O
spilled O
milk O
at O
the O
counter B-AS
, O
not O
paying O
any O
attention O
to O
the O
diners O
. O

Our O
waiter B-AS
took O
his O
sweet O
time O
bringing O
the O
menus B-AS
and O
telling O
us O
the O
specials B-AS
and O
it O
wasn O
' O
t O
until O
almost O
10 O
: O
15 O
that O
we O
put O
our O
order O
in O
. O

great O
decor B-AS
, O
unfortunately O
the O
worst O
service B-AS
possible I-AS
. O

The O
upside O
of O
Zen B-AS
Palate O
is O
the O
open B-AS
kitchen I-AS
, O
which O
allows O
you O
to O
watch O
the O
cooks B-AS
at O
work O
and O
removes O
fears O
of O
who O
only O
knows O
what O
the O
chefs B-AS
are O
doing O
in O
the O
back O
. O

I O
chose O
Guastavinos O
for O
my O
wedding O
reception B-AS
dinner I-AS
( O
for O
19 O
of O
us O
) O
and O
planned O
it O
through O
their O
private O
dining B-AS
staff I-AS
. O

No O
bar B-AS
only O
a O
waiting B-AS
area I-AS
with O
about O
10 O
tables B-AS
where O
you O
can O
have O
drinks B-AS
prior O
to O
dinner B-AS
. O

We O
organized O
a O
party O
at O
this O
bar B-AS
and O
have O
gotten O
very O
poor O
service B-AS
. O

They O
always O
greet O
me O
and O
my O
friends O
warmly O
, O
deliver O
food B-AS
promptly O
, O
are O
happy O
to O
answer O
questions O
about O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
and O
they O
almost O
always O
throw O
in O
a O
free O
dessert B-AS
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
meal O

, O
show O
off O
the O
talents O
of O
the O
San O
Sebastian O
- O
trained O
chefs O
. O

The O
seafood B-AS
is O
out O
of O
this O
world O
and O
priced O
accordingly B-AS
. O

The O
spinach B-AS
was O
the O
best O
thing O
on O
the O
menu O
, O
the O
shrooms O
were O
soaked O
in O
reduction O
, O
and O
the O
goose B-AS
fat I-AS
potatoes I-AS
were O
very O
decent O
. O

Basically O
, O
all O
the O
food O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
is O
a O
half O
- O
ass O
' O
d O
attempt O
at O
vietnamese O
food O
, O
followed O
by O
a O
innappropriate O
heap O
of O
MSG O
to O
make O
up O
for O
the O
lack O
of O
any O
flavor B-AS
. O

Had O
a O
terrible O
time O
making O
a O
reservation B-AS
and O
when O
we O
arrived O
they O
still O
had O
the O
table B-AS
count O
wrong O
, O
and O
that O
was O
after O
5 O
phone O
calls O
! O

I O
had O
a O
nice O
time B-AS
, O
place B-AS
was O
crowded O
but O
the O
food B-AS
was O
very O
good O
. O

Ive O
personally O
tried O
almost O
everything O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
and O
been O
amazed O
at O
the O
quality O
and O
presentation B-AS
. O

Lunch B-AS
( O
a B-AS
chicken I-AS
sandwich I-AS
on I-AS
baguette I-AS
with O
fries O
) O
was O
decent O
, O
brunch B-AS
( O
dry O
, O
hard O
pancakes B-AS
) O
was O
pretty O
bad O
. O

We O
got O
there O
before O
our O
reservation B-AS
and O
the O
seated B-AS
us O
quickly O
. O

They O
offer O
a O
sushi B-AS
bar I-AS
with O
very O
fresh O
fish B-AS
, O
and O
the O
side B-AS
dishes I-AS
are O
excellent O
. O

Great O
deal O
for O
lunch B-AS
; O
came O
to O
something O
like O
$ O
11 O
with O
tip B-AS
and O
tax O
! O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
couldn O
' O
t O
be O
better O
, O
and O
the O
service B-AS
was O
outstanding O
- O
- O
at O
the O
time O
there O
were O
only O
two O
people O
working O
the O
entire O
bar B-AS
, O
and O
we O
still O
got O
taken O
care O
of O
like O
it O
was O
a O
five O
star O
restaurant O
. O

Our O
waiter B-AS
was O
ever O
so O
helpful O
as O
he O
stood O
back O
and O
watched O
my O
sister O
and O
I O
physically O
move O
our O
table B-AS
. O

I O
was O
back O
- O
to O
- O
back O
with O
the O
diner B-AS
at O
the O
table O
behind O
me O
and O
wait O
staff B-AS
had O
to O
hoist O
trays B-AS
over O
our O
heads O
as O
they O
squeezed O
past O
us O
again O
and O
again O
. O

We O
hung O
out O
by O
the O
bar B-AS
mostly O
to O
ourselves O
, O
not O
an O
overwelming O
social O
crowd B-AS
, O
but O
there O
were O
some O
georgous O
groups O
of O
hipsters O
looking O
like O
it O
was O
their O
meeting O
up O
before O
going O
out O
to O
the O
clubs O
( O
a O
few O
of O
the O
girls O
looked O
like O
top O
models O
) O
, O
but O
the O
vibe O
was O
real O
chill O
. O

( O
food B-AS
was O
delivered O
by O
a O
busboy B-AS
, O
not O
waiter O
) O
We O
got O
no O
cheese B-AS
offered O
for O
the O
pasta O
, O
our O
water B-AS
and I-AS
wine I-AS
glasses I-AS
remained O
EMPTY O
our O
entire O
meal B-AS
, O
when O
we O
would O
have O
easily O
spent O
another O
$ O
20 O
on O
wine O
. O

While O
admitably O
, O
the O
seating B-AS
is O
a O
bit O
cramped O
, O
and O
the O
menu O
a O
tad O
pricey O
, O
the O
staff B-AS
does O
its O
best O
to O
remedy O
concerns O
. O

It O
was O
practically O
impossible O
to O
get O
the O
waitstaff B-AS
' O
s O
attention O
to O
order O
another O
bottle O
of O
wine B-AS
. O

It O
' O
s O
very O
cheap O
, O
food B-AS
is O
great O
you O
can O
bring O
your O
own O
bottle B-AS
of I-AS
wine I-AS
( O
saves O
sooo O
much O
money O
) O
The O
waiters B-AS
will O
uncork O
it O
bring O
you O
glasses B-AS
too O
! O

Menu B-AS
had O
several O
fish B-AS
selections I-AS
( O
snapper O
, O
salmon B-AS
, O
cod B-AS
) O
but O
all O
were O
around O
$ O
30 O
despite O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
portions B-AS
would O
hardly O
fill O
a O
child O
' O
s O
belly O
and O
the O
sides B-AS
were O
3 O
pieces O
of O
lettuce O
( O
literally O
) O
. O

I O
' O
m O
a O
serious O
sucker O
for O
the O
buns B-AS
listed O
in O
the O
appetizer B-AS
section O
: O
big O
, O
fluffy O
, O
feels O
like O
true O
sustenance O
. O

Although O
I O
usually O
go O
out O
mid O
- O
week O
for O
lunch B-AS
, O
I O
now O
make O
it O
a O
habit O
to O
stop O
out O
Thursday O
or O
Friday O
evening O
to O
enjoy O
the O
live B-AS
Jazz I-AS
band I-AS
. O

Space B-AS
is O
teeny O
tiny O
so O
waiting B-AS
at O
the O
bar B-AS
meant O
getting O
poked O
and O
bumped O
repeatedly O
, O
but O
hostesses O
were O
nice O
and O
wine B-AS
selection I-AS
was O
ample O
. O

We O
went O
inside O
to O
the O
lounge B-AS
and O
found O
that O
there O
were O
several O
empty O
tables B-AS
( O
which O
never O
ended O
up O
being O
occupied O
) O
. O

The O
quality B-AS
of O
the O
food B-AS
used O
to O
be O
worth O
the O
long O
waits O
but O
not O
anymore O
. O

even O
when O
they O
informed O
us O
they O
were O
out O
of O
the O
port O
we O
chose O
to O
accompany O
our O
dessert B-AS
, O
the O
manager B-AS
made O
sure O
that O
we O
were O
offered O
an O
even O
better O
bottle B-AS
that O
wasn O
' O
t O
even O
featured O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
. O

The O
caesar B-AS
salad I-AS
was O
a O
huge O
bowl B-AS
of I-AS
iceberg I-AS
lettuce I-AS
, O
a O
dressing B-AS
that O
wasn O
' O
t O

crouton O
and O
a O
few O
slices O
of O
thin B-AS
chicken I-AS
- O
- O
for O
$ O
12 O
. O

I O
asked O
the O
waiter B-AS
about O
the O
vintages B-AS
of O
the B-AS
wines I-AS
, O
to O
which O
he O
replied O
, O
I O
don O

know O

probably O
2003 O

2004 O

In O
Short O
Despite O
the O
tacky O
Hellenic O
decor B-AS
, O
replete O
with O
faux O
columns O
and O
signs O
of O
the O
zodiac O
carved O
into O
plaster O
walls O
, O
this O
Greek O
restaurant O
and O
bar B-AS
bursts O
with O
authenticity O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
menu O
and O
atmosphere B-AS
. O

The O
only O
thing O
whihc O
i O
( O
and O
my O
partner O
) O
never O
heard O
before O
was O
: O
the O

mentioned O
the O
price B-AS
of O
the O
specials B-AS
( O

small O

we O
ask O
for O
the O
check B-AS
, O
the O
waiter B-AS
says O
, O
ok O
, O
and O
5 O
minutes O
later O
asks O
if O
we O
want O
coffee O
or O

. O

On O
your O
way O
out O
, O
pick O
up O
a O

their O
Swiss O

We O
were O
a O
bit O
chatty O
so O
it O
took O
us O
a O
while O
to O
decide O
what O
to O
order O
, O
but O
when O
we O
made O
it O
abundantly O
clear O
we O
were O
ready O
( O
closed O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
looked O
around O
for O
our O
waiter B-AS

was O

To O
be O
fair O
, O
my O
husband O
' O

cheeseburger B-AS
was O
quite O
good O
, O
but O
the O
waitress B-AS
never O
apologized O
for O
the O
long O

or O
attempted O
to O

I O

the O
food B-AS
is O
still O
awesome O
- O
the O
twist O
on O
mexican O
is O
perfect O
- O
but O
the O
service O
is O
terrible O
- O
from O
the O
apathetic O
hosts B-AS
to O
the O
unbelievably O
slow O
servers B-AS
. O

After O
lunch B-AS
, O
we O
sat O
at O
the O
bar O
and O
chatted O
with O
the O
bartender B-AS
who O
was O
also O
very O
nice O
. O

FINALLY O
the O
waitress B-AS
came O
with O
our O
food B-AS
after O
an O
HOUR O
! O

the O
staff B-AS
were O
pleasant O
and O
easy O
- O
going O
and O
took O
time O
to O
explain O
the O
specials B-AS
to O
us O
as O
well O
as O
answer O
any O
questions O
we O
might O
have O
had O
. O

My O
entree B-AS
was O
just O
some O
noodles B-AS
in I-AS
a I-AS
butter I-AS
sauce I-AS
with O
no O
texture B-AS
or O
color O
, O
except O
for O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
spinach O
which O
was O
more O
like O
a O
garnish O
. O

Attention O
to O
detail O
in O
the O
ingredients B-AS
, O
always O
cut O
to O
the O
right O
size O
so O
as O
to O
blend O
the O
flavor B-AS
with O
the O
tastes B-AS
of O
spices B-AS
pefectly O
in O
your O
mouth O
. O

sashimi B-AS
was O
meh O
, O
salmon B-AS
was O
good O
but O
the O
tuna B-AS
was O
a O
little O
white O
and O
seemed O
like O
the O
day O
before O
as O
the O
flavor B-AS
had O
faded O
. O

The O
two O
vegetarian B-AS
dishes I-AS
on O
the O
menu B-AS
were O
just O
an O
afterthought O
- O
- O
why O
did O
they O
even O
bother O
? O

The O
hostess B-AS
kept O
me O
waiting B-AS
10 O
minutes O
( O
attempting O
to O
read O
seating B-AS
chart O
which O
I O
assume O
was O
in O
cyrillic O
) O
before O
determining O
whether O
she O
could O
seat O
us O
. O

Our O
waiter B-AS
, O
even O
though O
he O
was O
serving O
dinner O
, O
was O
SO O
out O
to O
lunch B-AS
. O

The O
portions B-AS
were O
pretty O
small O
for O
the O
price B-AS
, O
I O
thought O
, O
and O
I O
never O
got O
the O
coffee B-AS
I O
ordered O
. O

the O
server B-AS
absolutely O
did O
not O
know O
what O
in O
the O
world O
he O
was O
talking O
about O
when O
we O
aske O
questios O
about O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
and O
he O
barely O
spoke O
English O
. O

Fresh O
, O
original O
, O
creative O
, O
absolutely O
delicious O
- O
Perhaps O
I O
would O
chose O
a O
table B-AS
at O
this O
cozy O
Italian O
corner B-AS
versus O
an O
NYC O
top O
5 O
? O

Always O
try O
one O
of O
the O
daily B-AS
specials I-AS
, O
in O
addition O
to O
all O
the O
tasty O
morsels O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
. O

( O
dissapointed O
) O
Over O
price B-AS
for O
a O
lunch B-AS
menu I-AS
, O
including O
the O
lunch B-AS
specials I-AS
( O
be O
smart O
. O

I O
only O
saw O
one O
waitress B-AS
for O
the O
entire O
place B-AS
, O
and O
small O
as O
it O
is O
, O
she O
only O
came O
to O
our O
table O
to O
take O
our O
order O
and O
take O
away O
plates O
, O
not O
once O
asking O
us O
if O
our O
food B-AS
was O
to O
our O
liking O
. O

Starting O
off O
with O
an O
excellent O
carafe O
of O
Cotes O
du O
rhone O
suggested O
by O
the O
waiter B-AS
, O
we O
soon O
ordered O
a O
few O
appetizers B-AS
like O
the O
steak B-AS
tartare I-AS
, O
the O
escargot B-AS
and O
the O
goat B-AS
cheese I-AS
tart I-AS
. O

Space B-AS
gets O
kind O
of O
crowded O
in O
there O
- O
- O
because O
it O
' O
s O
so O
popular O
- O
- O
but O
it O
' O
s O
worth O
the O
wait B-AS
because O
the O
food B-AS
is O
very O
good O
. O

Tables B-AS
are O
a O
little O
cramped O
, O
but O
dinner B-AS
or O
lunch O
for O
2 O
is O
fine O
. O

We O
sat O
for O
20 O
- O
40min O
without O
water B-AS
or O
bread B-AS
and O
were O
basically O
ignored O
by O
the O
waitstaff B-AS
. O

The O
Server B-AS
took O
the O
order O
and O
disappeared O
for O
the O
entire O
rest O
of O
the O
night O
until O
we O
had O
to O
stop O
him O
b O
/ O
c O
the O
bus O
boy O
knocked O
over O
our O
entire O
bottle O
of O
red O
wine O
soaking O
the O
white O
table O
cloth O
, O
the O
seats B-AS
and O
our O
business O
suits O
. O

For O
the O
cost B-AS
of O
the O
lunch B-AS
I O
expected O
much O
better O
service B-AS
. O

I O
went O
here O
for O
a O
dinner B-AS
with O
some O
relatives O
from O
out O
of O
town O
that O
I O
was O
eager O
to O
catch O
up O
with O
, O
but O
the O
noise B-AS
level I-AS
at O
this O
place O
made O
that O
really O
difficult O
! O

The O
wait B-AS
time I-AS
for O
food B-AS
can O
be O
long O
, O
so O
don O
' O
t O
dine O
here O
if O
you O
' O
re O
in O
a O
hurry O
. O

i O
think O
that O
the O
second O
floor O
is O
better O
if O
you O
prefer O
a O
quieter O
environment B-AS
for O
dinner B-AS
. O

The O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
is O
friendly O
and O
helpful O
and O
kudos O
to O
the O
sushi B-AS
chef I-AS
Hero O
who O
serves O
up O
great O
dishes B-AS
on O
and O
off O
the O
menu B-AS
and O
is O
always O
wearing O
a O
smile O
. O

Try O
the O
sticky O
rice B-AS
in O
lotus O
leaves O
, O
and O
finish O
with O
the O
almond B-AS
jellow O
for O
dessert B-AS
- O
if O
you O
don O
' O
t O
like O
these O
dishes O
then O
you O
probably O
don O
' O
t O
like O
real O
Chinese B-AS
food I-AS
! O

Our O
waiter B-AS
( O
a O
real O
cutie O
) O
had O
to O
ask O
us O
twice O
for O
our O
entree B-AS
selections O
, O
the O
coffee O
orders O
were O
wrong O
and O
after O
saying O
, O
no O
, O
thanks O
, O
the O
pepper B-AS
man I-AS
poised O
his O
mill O
above O
my O
friend O
' O
s O
calamari O
dish O
and O
ground O
away O
. O

Portions B-AS
enough O
for O
2 O
meals B-AS
. O

the O
waitress B-AS
was O
surly O
- O
- O
refused O
to O
bring O
sweetner O
for O
my O
tea B-AS
! O
! O

I O
ordered O
the O
strip O
steak B-AS
medium O
- O
the O
waiter B-AS
or O
the O
chef B-AS
reversed O
our O
requests O
. O

The O
waitresses B-AS
are O
so O
nice O
and O
will O
even O
help O
you O
pick O
a O
meal B-AS
if O
you O
are O
new O
to O
spanish O
food B-AS
. O

There O
is O
a O
bar B-AS
right O
by O
the O
door O
, O
which O
is O
convenient O
while O
waiting O
in O
the O
long O
lines B-AS
for O
a O
seat B-AS
and O
be O
prepared O
to O
wait O
on O
the O
weekends O
. O

I O
ended O
up O
wasting O
$ O
24 O
on O
the O
most O
expensive O
dish B-AS
on O
the O
menu B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
well O
thought O
out O
and O
each O
bite O
should O
contain O
a O
little O
of O
everything O
on O
your O
dish B-AS
for O
the O
full O
effect B-AS
. O

the O
food B-AS
is O
neither O
tasty O
nor O
reasonably O
priced B-AS
( O
$ O
137 O
for O
four O
with O
one O
glass B-AS
of I-AS
wine I-AS
total O
? O

I O
waited O
for O
45 O
minutes O
for O
my O
entree B-AS
to O
realize O
that O
the O
waiter B-AS
never O
put O
the O
order O
in O
. O

Our O
hostess B-AS
was O
more O
concerned O
about O
the O
appearance O
of O
the O
banquets O
than O
wether O
we O
had O
the O
right O
menus B-AS
. O

We O
sat O
in O
the O
tables O
in O
front O
of O
the O
bar B-AS
and O
it O
was O
a O
good O
people O
watching O
spot B-AS
. O

On O
top O
of O
that O
, O
when O
we O
tried O
to O
order O
more O
food O
half O
- O
way O
through O
our O
first O
entree O
order O
, O
the O
waitress B-AS
told O
us O
that O
we O
couldn O
' O
t O
because O
they O
needed O
the O
table O
for O
another O
reservation B-AS
! O

However O
, O
didnt O
take O
too O
long O
to O
get O
drinks B-AS
and O
the O
hostess B-AS
seated O
us O
promptly O
. O

Their O
pasta B-AS
isn O
' O
t O
spectacular O
nor O
is O
their O
marinara B-AS
sauce I-AS
, O
but O
their O
appetizers B-AS
are O
wonderful O
. O

I O
was O
craving O
for O
the O
Chicken O
Penne O
for O
a O
long O
time O
after O
that O
, O
and O
so O
I O
went O
and O
ordered O
it O
for O
lunch B-AS
, O
but O
the O
chicken O
was O
not O
fresh O
and O
the O
bread B-AS
was O
tough O
too O
. O

Its O
the O
perfect O
place B-AS
to O
take O
a O
date O
, O
start O
out O
with O
dinner B-AS
and O
then O
stick O
around O
for O
dancing O
! O

i O
went O
here O
on O
a O
whim O
and O
found O
out O
you O
could O
get O
sushi B-AS
for O
half O
price B-AS
kind O
of O
like O
happy O
hour O
. O

Although O
there O
were O
many O
open O
tables O
, O
the O
manager B-AS
insisted O
my O
party O
wait O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
for O
over O
one O
hour O
. O

the O
best O
thing O
is O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
, O
but O
even O
that O
is O
overshadowed O
by O
the O
lack O
of O
taste O
and O
originality O
in O
the O
food B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
very O
good O
for O
the O
price B-AS
. O

That O
, O
the O
Peruvian B-AS
style I-AS
rotisserie I-AS
chicken I-AS
( O
get O
a O
whole O
one O
) O
and O

alcoholic I-AS
drink I-AS
made O
from O
boiled O
purple O
corn O
and O
lime O
juice O
with O
tiny O
pear O
cubes O
and O
a O
bit O
of O
sugar B-AS
. O

Our O
waiter B-AS
did O
not O
come O
back O
once O
to O
reserve O
our O
wine B-AS
. O

We O
shared O
three O
appetizers B-AS
, O
( O
bruschetta B-AS
' O
s O
a O
good O
bet O
) O
a O
salad O
, O
a O
pasta B-AS
dish I-AS
, O
a O
quatro O
( O
about O
3 O
glasses O
? O
) O

The O
line B-AS
is O
long O
, O
but O
the O
staff B-AS
keeps O
it O
moving O
and O
usually O
everyone O
is O
friendly O
. O

The O
menu O
was O
still O
small O
, O
but O
the O
quality B-AS
of I-AS
food I-AS
that O
came O
out O
of O
the O
kitchen B-AS
was O
superb O
, O
and O
the O
service B-AS
was O
not O
bad O
at O
all O
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
knows O
us O
now O
, O
and O
the O
owner B-AS
bought O
us O
a O
round B-AS
of I-AS
drinks I-AS
once O
because O
the O
dessert B-AS
took O
too O
long O
( O
in O
his O
opinion O
, O
we O
didn O
' O
t O
even O
complain O
) O
. O

My O
meal B-AS
here O
was O
awesome O
, O
the O
appetizers O
, O
the O
bar B-AS
finger I-AS
food I-AS
, O
the O

, O
Clay B-AS
pot I-AS
salmon I-AS
, O
Lobster B-AS
rolls I-AS
, O
and O
the O
dining B-AS
room I-AS
is O
spectacular O
. O

If O
you O
happen O
to O
catch O
it O
when O
no O
one O
else O
is O
there O
, O
sit O
down O
at O
the O
table B-AS
, O
get O
a O
tea O
and O
try O
the O
coconut B-AS
cake I-AS
. O

That O
said O
, O
I O
made O
sure O
to O
pay O
before O
we O
had O
coffee B-AS
, O
so O
that O
the O
server B-AS
was O
not O
waiting B-AS
on O
us O
to O
pay O
; O
and O
I O
left O
a O
30 O
% O
tip O
, O
knowing O
we O
' O
d O
be O
there O
for O
a O
while O
. O

Our O
waitress B-AS
forgot O
to O
bring O
me O
another O
margarita B-AS
, O
but O
somehow O
she O
managed O
to O
get O
it O
on O
the O
bill O
. O

The O
DJ B-AS
at O
the O
bar B-AS
kept O
the O
place O
alive O
. O

The O
ambiance B-AS
and O
service B-AS
is O
great O
but O
I O
wish O
I O
could O
say O
the O
same O
about O
the O
food B-AS
. O

We O
were O
ignored O
by O
our O
waitress B-AS
after O
our O
entrees B-AS
had O
been O
served O
. O

The O
menu B-AS
is O
slightly O
different O
from O
downtown O
, O
but O
they O
still O
have O
my O
favorites O
- O
- O
madai O
salad O
with O
hot O
sesame O
oil O
, O
shrimp O
kanzuri O
, O
the O
diamond O
roll O
, O
the O
crispy O
shrimp B-AS
roll I-AS
. O

Forget O
the O
phony O
yuppies O
of O
Areos O
and O
The O
Pearl B-AS
Room I-AS
, O
and O
ENJOY O
the O
down O
home O
service B-AS
and O
OUTSTANDING O

Nothing O
like O
using O
iceberg B-AS
lettuce I-AS
, O
cooked O
chicken O
and O
a O
tangy O
salad O
dressing O
just O
to O
put O
a O
fancy O
name O

ONE O
OF O
THE O
BEST O
PIZZA B-AS
IN O
BROOKLYN O
, O
NEED O
AN O
AC O
FOR O
SUMMER B-AS
. O

The O
environment B-AS
is O
a O
touch O
loud O
( O
although O
the O
music B-AS
' O
s O
good O
) O
, O
but O
the O
walls O
sport O
nifty O
vintage O
items O
, O
from O
license O
plates B-AS
to O
pennants O
to O
movie O
posters O
. O

I O
came O
here O
b O
/ O
c O
someone O
gave O
a O
trashy O
review O
to O
my O
favorite O
coffee B-AS
place I-AS
( O
Grey B-AS
Dog I-AS
' O
s O
) O
and O
compared O
it O
to O
this O
place O
so O
I O
had O
to O
see O
for O
myself O
what O
was O
so O
great O
about O
71 O
. O

Even O
as O
a O
stranger O
, O
the O
service B-AS
at O
the O
bar B-AS
was O
excellent O
as O
was O
the O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
who O
continuously O
checked O
back O
to O
see O
if O
I O
was O
okay O
while O
waiting B-AS
for O
my O
party O
. O

After O
a O
short O
wait B-AS
at O
the O
bar B-AS
( O
which O
was O
very O
crowded O
) O
, O
we O
were O
seated O
upstairs O
at O
a O
private O
table O
. O

Rely O
on O
your O
food B-AS
, O
your O
chef B-AS
, O
your O
decor B-AS
, O
your O
impeccable O
service B-AS
, O
SOMETHING O
other O
than O
creating O
some O
fake O
VIP O
atmosphere B-AS
to O
make O
people O
feel O
as O
if O
they O
need O
to O
gain O
admission O
in O
order O
to O
feel O
better O
about O
themselves O
. O

Looked O
good O
, O
lacked O
in O
seasoning B-AS
, O
maybe O
that O
' O
s O
why O
they O
leave O
the O
Old O
Bay O
on O
the O
Table B-AS
, O
to O
season O
everything O
yourself O
. O

The O
owner B-AS
circles O
the O
place O
asking O
patrons O
if O
their O
meals B-AS
are O
fine O
. O

OK O
so O
the O
decor B-AS
is O
a O
little O
old O
and O
tacky O
but O
it O
adds O
to O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
. O

Yoguart B-AS
/ I-AS
mint I-AS
/ I-AS
jalipeno I-AS
sauce I-AS
for O
instance O
didn O
' O
t O
work O
with O
asparagus B-AS
. O

I O
go O
to O
Hing O
Won O
pretty O
often O
for O
lunch B-AS
because O
it O
is O
close O
by O
and O
the O
prices B-AS
are O
right O
. O

Just O
make O
sure O
everyone O
is O
in O
your O
party O
is O
there O
together O
or O
you O
' O
ll O
be O
waiting B-AS
on O
the O
sidewalk O
or O
in O
the O
cramped O
bar B-AS
next O
door O

The O
waiter B-AS

of O

had O
no O
knowledge O
of O

list O
and O
no O
wine O
steward O
or O
manager B-AS
bothered O
to O
come O
by O
the O
table B-AS
to O
check O
in O
. O

For O
dessert B-AS
I O
had O
the O
green B-AS
tea I-AS
tiramisu I-AS
and O
ice O
cream O
- O
I O
loved O
both O
, O
my O
bf O
who O
doesn O
' O
t O
really O
like O
green O
tea O
actually O
really O
liked O
the O
tiramisu O
. O

The O
ambience B-AS
is O
stunning O
and O
the O
food B-AS
is O
really O
good O
, O
but O
the O
portions B-AS
are O
RIDICULOUSLY O
small O
. O

For O
those O
who O
don O
' O
t O
like O
that O
you O
have O
to O
make O
a O
reservation B-AS
, O
to O
the O
restaurant O
' O
s O
credit O
, O
this O
allows O
the O
restaurant O
to O
remain O
uncrowded O
and O
seat B-AS
you O
immediately O
( O
at O
least O
this O
happened O
to O
my O
party O
) O
. O

Not O
the O
ideal O
spot B-AS
when O
you O
' O
re O
really O
hungry O
- O
- O
the O
plates B-AS
are O
tiny O
and O
the O
prices B-AS
not O
( O
like O
every O
other O
upscale O
tapas B-AS
place O
) O
. O

The O
crust B-AS
was O
good O
, O
the O
flavor B-AS
was O
good O
( O
I O
think O
they O
grate O
some O
sort O
of O
hard O
cheese O
over O
the O
pie B-AS
) O
, O
but O
the O
pizza B-AS
was O
a O
bit O
watery O
, O
with O
the O
cheese O
sliding O
off O
rather O
than O
clinging O
to O
the O
slice O
. O

I O
had O
to O
wait O
quite O
a O
while O
to O
get O
my O
food B-AS
and O
the O
waitress B-AS
almost O
knocked O
me O
in O
the O
head O
with O
her O
tray O
. O

AND O
you O
can O
still O
smoke O
at O
the O
outermost O
area B-AS
of O
the O
patio B-AS
- O
the O
wait O
staff O
can O
' O
t O
technically O
serve O
you O
there O
because O
of O
the O
smoking O
, O
but O
if O
you O
don O
' O
t O
mind O
walking O
to O
the O
bar B-AS
to O
place O
an O
order O
( O
I O
don O
' O
t O
) O
, O
it O
' O
s O
a O
great O
solution B-AS
for O
smokers O
. O

The O
last O
time O
I O
was O
there O
( O
last O
week O
) O
our O
food B-AS
took O
a O
little O
too O
long O
and O
a O
manager B-AS
promptly O
apologized O
and O
offered O
to O
comp O
our O
desserts O
( O
not O
expected O
but O
appreciated O
) O
. O

Once O
seated B-AS
, O
there O
was O
no O
waitress B-AS
to O
give O
us O
our O
menus B-AS
. O

Though O
it O
can O
be O
expensive O
, O
since O
you O
buy O
the O
fish B-AS
and O
sides B-AS
seperate O
and O
soem O
might O
get O
tired O
of O
shelling O
the O
shrimp B-AS
themselves I-AS
. O

If O
going O
for O
lunch B-AS
, O
best O
to O
go O
by O
12 O
: O
30 O
, O
even O
if O
getting O
take O
- O
out O
, O
the O
place B-AS
is O
tiny O
and O
fills O
up O
quickly O
, O
both O
with O
people O
eating O
there O
, O
and O
standing O
waiting B-AS
for O
take O
- O
out O
orders O
. O

Whether O
it O
is O
a O
weekend O
brunch O
, O
dinner O
, O
or O
just O
hanging O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
for O
cocktails O
, O
we O
always O
have O
THE O
BEST O
TIME B-AS
. O

8pm O
reservation B-AS
, O
place B-AS
was O
half O
empty O
on O
a O
Saturday O
. O

It O
came O

) O
salad B-AS
, O
large O
bowl B-AS
of I-AS
udon I-AS
, O
and O
6 O
pieces O
of O
sushi O
plus O
wrapped O
rice O
( O
not O
sure O
what O
that O
was O
called O
. O

I O
did O
like O
the O
shrimp B-AS
dish I-AS
, O
but O
I O
don O
' O
t O
know O
if O
I O
' O
d O
seek O
out O
their O
cuisine B-AS
again O
. O

Extremely O
RUDE O
servers B-AS
who O
intially O
took O
our O
order O
and O
never O
returned O
with O
drinks B-AS
or O
to O
see O
if O
we O
required O
anythign O
else O
. O

The O
dining B-AS
rooms I-AS
are O
opulent O
and O
beautiful O
; O
Great O
waiter B-AS
who O
brought O
out O
a O
special O
birthday O
desert B-AS
for O
my O
date O
after O
asking O
if O
our O
dinner B-AS
was O
a O
special O
occasion O
. O

I O
tried O
several O
dishes O
, O
while O
at O
dinner B-AS
with O
friends O
, O
and O
was O
amazed O
to O
discover O
that O
even O
their O
Caesar O
Salad O
was O
completely O
lacking O
in O
flavor B-AS
. O

4 O
- O
Got O
attitude O
from O
the O
waitress B-AS
at O
every O
moment O
she O
was O
at O
the O
table B-AS
. O

There O
was O
a O
short O
wait B-AS
for O
a O
table B-AS
, O
which O
we O
spent O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
, O
then O
we O
were O
seated O
on O
their O
patio B-AS
. O

) O
Not O
only O
do O
they O
do O
the O
shabu O
write O
with O
good O
ingredients B-AS
, O
the B-AS
sauces I-AS
are O
both O
great O
, O
i O
recommend O
sesame B-AS
for O
the O
meats B-AS
and O
the O
other O
one O
for O
vegetables B-AS
. O

From O
the O
sushi B-AS
to O
the O
terayki O
the O
food B-AS
is O
excellent O
and O
the O
service B-AS
( O
with O
a O
smile O
) O
is O
unmatched O
. O

presides O
over O

i O
' O
ve O
been O
there O
for O
lunch B-AS
- O
when O
the O
place O
is O
empty O
- O
and O
the O
waiter B-AS
spent O
more O
time O
outside O
, O
soaking O
up O
the O
sun O
for O
himself O
, O
like O
he O
was O
a O
patron O
. O

Yesterday O
they O
had O
numerous O
bartenders B-AS
as O
well O
as O
servers B-AS
and O
the O
place B-AS
wasn O
' O
t O
packed O
and O
it O
still O
took O
1 O
/ O
2 O
an O
hour O
to O
make O
a O
martini B-AS
. O

If O
the O
food O
is O
out O
of O
your O
price B-AS
range O
then O
at O
least O
go O
for O
happy O
hour O
for O
a O
drink O
- O
although O
the O
drinks O
cost O
a O
bit O
more O
then O
the O
average O
happy O
hour O
bar B-AS
after O
you O
receive O
one O
you O
would O
agree O
that O
it O
is O
worth O
it O
. O

These O
are O
all O
new O
items O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
the O
waiter B-AS
told O
us O
, O
and O
they O
were O
delicious O
! O

The O
service B-AS
was O
good O
and O
the O
price B-AS
was O
decent O
but O
it O
wasn O
' O
t O
enough O
to O
overcome O
the O
bland O
tasting O
food B-AS
and O
the O
bland O
decor B-AS
of O
the O
restaurant O
. O

My O
date O
enjoyed O
his O
food B-AS
, O
he O
had O
some O
type O
of O
jambalaya O
dish B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
pretty O
good O
but O
the O
portions B-AS
were O
smaller O
than O
what O
I O
would O
expect O
for O
brunch O
. O

On O
my O
last O
visit O
we O
arrived O
around O
9 O
on O
a O
Saturday O
, O
and O
although O
it O
wasn O
' O
t O
crowded O
, O
the O
waitress B-AS
acted O
like O
we O
were O
inconveniencing O
her O
, O
forgot O
bread B-AS
, O
drinks B-AS
, O
etc O
. O

I O
wouldn O
' O
t O
say O
Bubby O
' O
s O
will O
blow O
you O
out O
of O
the O
water B-AS
, O
but O
they O
provide O
a O
solid O
bunch O
served O
with O
good O
coffee B-AS
. O

Waiters B-AS
poured O
wine O
like O
water B-AS
, O
my O
guests O
were O
wondering O
out O
loud O
if O
they O
would O
get O
straws O
for O
the O
wine B-AS
next I-AS
. O

Went O
there O
for O
dinner B-AS
last O
night O
w O
/ O
my O
boyfriend O
and O
a O
friend O
after O
work O
and O
got O
there O
around O
7 O
so O
we O
were O
able O
to O
score O
seats O
in O
this O
tiny O
cramped O
space B-AS
. O

The O
sevice O
and O
food B-AS
were O
excelent O
, O
but O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
menu B-AS
were O
the O
words O
, O
cash O
only O
. O

The O
staff B-AS
is O
very O
friendly O
too O
~ O
Everything O
is O
wonderful O
about O
this O
place O
except O
for O
the O
bathroom B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
simply O
remarkable O
as O
is O
the O
fiery O
female O
master O
sommelier B-AS
! O

After O
an O
hour O
of O
waiting B-AS
at O
an O
overcrowded O
bar B-AS
with O
our O
coats O
in O
our O
hands O
and O
no O
room B-AS
to O
move O
, O
I O
approached O
the O
host B-AS
( O
who O
never O
bothered O
to O
give O
us O
an O
update O
throughout O
our O
wait O
) O
to O
ask O
him O
how O
much O
longer O
, O
He O
was O
incredibly O
rude O
and O
dismissed O
me O
with O
his O
hand O
and O
walked O
away O
from O
me O
while O
I O
was O
trying O
to O
talk O
to O
him O
! O

If O
it O
' O
s O
atmosphere B-AS
you O
want O
go O
to O
the O
River O
Cafe O
under O
the O
bridges O
and O
pay O
an O
arm O
and O
a O
leg O
for O
hospital O
- O
type O
food B-AS
. O

The O
mussles B-AS
appetizer I-AS
was O
delicious O
along O
with O
my O
peppercorn O
steak B-AS
. O

In O
Short O
This O

pancakes B-AS
, O
is O
favorite O
pitstop O
for O
folks O
visiting O
the O
Brooklyn O
Museum O
and O
Botanical O
Gardens B-AS
. O

In O
the O
middle O
of O
dessert B-AS
, O
the O
waitress B-AS
silently O
passes O
by O
and O
drops O
the O
check O
. O

As O
the O
night O
rolls O
on O
the O
place O
turns O
into O
a O
bar O
/ O
lounge O
so O
the O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
is O
constantly O
rushing O
you O
to O
eat O
up O
and O
move O
out O
, O
not O
the O
kind O
of O
atmosphere B-AS
you O
want O
for O
the O
price B-AS
you O
are O
paying O
for O
your O
entree B-AS
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
professional O
if O
somewhat O
slow O
, O
though O
we O
didn O
' O
t O
mind O
since O
it O
is O
such O
a O
welcoming O
place O
to O
have O
dinner B-AS
. O

I O
went O
here O
with O
my O
family O
for O
dinner B-AS
expecting O
the O
usual O
great O
pizza B-AS
. O

It O
seemed O
to O
take O
the O
new B-AS
staff I-AS
forever O
to O
figure O
out O
what O
they O
were O
doing O
; O
I O
had O
one O
nightmare O
of O
a O
brunch B-AS
where O
the O
registers O
didn O
' O
t O
seem O
to O
work O
and O
it O
literally O
took O
over O
an O
hour O
to O
get O
our O
check O
. O

Place B-AS
was O
empty O
, O
waitress B-AS
was O
rude O
, O
told O
us O
that O
even O
though O
there O
were O
drink B-AS
specials I-AS
at O
the O
bar O
( O
2 O
for O
1 O
margaritas O
) O
, O
we O
couldn O
' O
t O
have O
them O
at O
our O
table O
and O
we O
couldn O
' O
t O
go O
up O
to O
the O
bar O
to O
get O
drinks O
. O

My O
appetizer B-AS
of O
endive O
and O
bleu O
cheese O
salad O
was O
a O
surprisingly O
large O
serving B-AS
which O
balanced O
the O
striped O
bass O
entree O
( O
served O
on O
a O
bed O
of O
vegetables O
) O
. O

The O
outdoor B-AS
tables I-AS

omelets O

pancakes B-AS
, O
French B-AS
toast I-AS
- I-AS
- I-AS
served I-AS
on O
cast O
iron O
skillets O
and O
griddles O
. O

The O
wine B-AS
was O
great O
and O
they O
kept O
bringing O
us O
bread B-AS
, O
these O
were O
the O
two O
best O
things O
about O
the O
meal B-AS
. O

After O
stopping O
by O
on O
a O
whim O
a O
few O
months O
ago O
, O
I O
was O
so O
extremely O
impressed O
by O
the O
fresh O
Sushi B-AS
and O
quality O
service B-AS
that O
I O
now O
go O
there O
quite O
often O
for O
lunch B-AS
as O
well O
as O
the O
occasional O
take O
- O
out O

On O

which O
, O
the O
waiter B-AS
doesn O

the O
busboy B-AS
brought O
us O
the O
wrong O
food B-AS
3 O
times O
, O
and O
there O
' O
s O
barely O
any O
room O
while O
you O
' O
re O
waiting O
to O
sit O
and O
have O
a O

you O
can O
pick O
two O

tea I-AS
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
luches O
in O
the O

. O

I O
never O
have O
to O
wait B-AS
a O
long O
time O
to O
get O
my O
food B-AS
, O
so O
it O
' O
s O
a O
great O
place O
to O
go O
if O
you O
' O
re O
really O
hungry O
and O

Service B-AS
was O
horrendous O
the O
night O
we O
went O
for O
dinner B-AS
. O

Odd O
considering O
my O
brunch B-AS
turned O
out O
to O
be O
a O
nuked O
hors O

' O
oevre O
quiche O
tart B-AS
on O
a O

with O

- O
what O
a O
rip O

off O
! O

the O
grain B-AS
salad I-AS
was O
ok O
, O
the O
calf B-AS
liver I-AS
was O
stringy O
and O
the O
roast B-AS
onions I-AS
that O
came O
with O
it O
too O
heavy O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
average O
for O
brunch B-AS
anywhere O
in O
NYC O
, O
and O
priced O
well O
above O
average O
. O

They O
do O
make O
great O
burgers B-AS
for O
the O
money B-AS
and O
give O
big O
portions B-AS
of I-AS
fries I-AS
with O
it O
. O

Went O
to O
Chow B-AS
Bar I-AS
for O
dinner B-AS
, O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
kind O
of O
pricey O
, O
but O
the O
food B-AS
and O
the O
service O
was O
good O
- O
but O
it O
wasn O
' O
t O
incredibly O
busy O
, O
so O
maybe O
they O
just O
had O
more O
free O
time O
to O
devote O
to O
us O
. O

The O
food O
was O
OK O
, O
but O
trying O
to O
get O
anything O
, O
like O
a O
drink B-AS
refill O
or O
the O
check O
, O
was O
an O
ordeal O
, O
and O
this O
was O
when O
the O
place B-AS
was O
nearly O
empty O
! O

A O
simple O
shrimp B-AS

on O
the O

, O
while O
dinner O
items O
tend O
to O
be O
more O
sophisticated O
, O
such O
as O
turkey O
filet O
mignon O
with O
bacon O
and O
a O
bold O
mole O
negro O
. O

The O
menu B-AS

a O
very O
sexy O
feel O
. O

our O
waitress B-AS
couldn O
' O
t O
explain O
or O
describe O
the O
specials B-AS
to O
us O
, O
and O
a O
group O
of O
five O
people O
seemed O
to O
overwhelm O
her O
. O

I O
took O
8 O
clients O
to O
lunch B-AS
and O
was O
appaled O
by O
the O
overall O
service B-AS
. O

Before O
our O
server B-AS
took O
our O
drink B-AS
order O
she O
told O
us O
that O
the O
prices B-AS
on O
the O
menu B-AS
were O
going O
to O
be O
higher O
that O
night O
because O
of O
the O
party O
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
( O
someone O
I O
know O
has O
been O
working O
there O
since O
it O
was O
just O
LCB O
) O
POURED O
MY O
WINE B-AS
FROM O
THE O
DIRTY O
GLASS O
INTO O
A O
CLEAN O
ONE O
AND O
SERVED O
IT O
TO O
ME O
! O

Cornelia O
Street O
looks O
like O
a O
Broadway O
set O
for O
West O
Side O
Story O
and O
the O
inside O
of O
Po O
is O
so O
cool O
quaint O
you O
really O
can O
' O
t O
top O
the O
setting B-AS
for O
a O
romantic O
dinner B-AS
in O
NYC O
. O

Ok O
, O
so O
the O
service B-AS
can O
be O
a O
little O
spotty O
, O
but O
despite O
this O
Cafe B-AS
Con O
Leche O
has O
good O
food B-AS
, O
and O
decent O
prices B-AS
. O

However O
, O
they O
do O
bring O
you O
a O
lot O
of O
food O
for O
your O
buck O
, O
and O
despite O
the O
unremarkable O
food O
it O
strikes O
me O
as O
a O
good O
place B-AS
to O
fill O
up O
on O
the O
cheap O
for O
lunch B-AS
or O
after O
a O
night O
of O
drinking O
. O

i O
' O
ve O
had O
practically O
everything O
on O
their O
menu B-AS
as O
i O
dine O
out O
alot O
but O
their O
burgers B-AS
and O
mussels B-AS
with I-AS
fries I-AS
are O
what O
bring O
me O
there O
every O
friday O
night O
. O

It O
' O
s O
served B-AS
cold O
with O
carmelized B-AS
onions I-AS
atop I-AS
, O
with O
mashed B-AS
potatoes I-AS
on O
the O
side O
and O
it O
' O
s O
the O
best O
darn B-AS
thing O
this O
side O
of O
the O
Hudson O
. O

I O
said O
, O
that O
would O
be O
fine O
and O
had O
the O
hostess B-AS
confirm O
my O
reservation B-AS
before O
hanging O
up O
. O

I O
have O
been O
there O
for O
lunch B-AS
many O
times O
and O
have O
always O
enjoyed O
my O
sushi B-AS
. O

However O
the O
hostess B-AS
completely O
ignored O
us O
, O
we O
waited O
40 O
min O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
( O
even O
with O
reservation B-AS
) O
, O
our O
waitress B-AS
was O
incredibly O
uninterested O
in O
us O
( O
never O
even O
offered O
dessert O
menus O
) O
and O
the O
somelier O
could O
have O
taken O
a O
look O
at O
the O
label O
before O
he O
made O
a O
mistake O
about O
his O
favorite O
wine O
. O

The O
host B-AS
' O
s O
explanation O
was O
they O
could O
not O
control O
when O
people O
finish O
dinner B-AS
. O

I O
had O
been O
to O
Blue O
Fin O
previously O
for O
drinks B-AS
and O
appetizers O
and O
thought O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
was O
very O
good O
( O
expecially O
for O
people O
watching O
) O
. O

The O
lobster B-AS
bisque I-AS
had O
a O
pasty O
bitter O
taste O
and O
the O
softshell O
crab O
was O
deep O
fried O
, O
served O
on O
a O
bunch O
of O
greens B-AS
it O
had O
0 O
flavor B-AS
. O

The O
free O
champaign B-AS
and O
desserts B-AS
do O
not O
really O
help O
me O
to O
even O
consider O
going O
back O
. O

As O
if O
that O
wasnt O
enough O
, O
after O
another O
in O
the O
group O
mentioned O
that O
a O
portion B-AS
of O
the O
sushi B-AS
on O
her O
plate O
was O
not O
what O
she O
had O
ordered O
, O
the O
waiter B-AS
came O
back O
with O
chopsticks B-AS
and O
started O
to O
remove O
it O
( O
as O
she O
was O
eating O
! O
) O

Smiling O
servers B-AS
quiz O
diners B-AS
with O
movie O
trivia O
, O
but O
forget O
to O
fill O
their O
water B-AS
glasses I-AS
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
the O
chicken B-AS
hearts O
, O
but O
remember O
: O
ask O
the O
waiters B-AS
, O
since O
they O
' O
re O
not O
usually O
available O
and O
will O
be O
cooked O
upon O
request O
( O
and O
will O
go O
fast O
) O
. O

We O
had O
at O
least O
10 O
of O
the O
appetizers B-AS
on O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
which O
all O
were O
delicious O
. O

While O
the O
recently O
added O
outdoor B-AS
seating I-AS
was O
what O
drew O
me O
and O
my O
friend O
to O
the O
restaurant O
, O
the O
food O
, O
service B-AS
and O
overall O
experience O
were O
what O
drove O
us O
out O
! O

prices B-AS
were O
low O
, O
you O
got O
a O
good O
deal O
, O
sushi B-AS
was O
ok O
; O
everybody O
wins O
. O

Was O
greeted O
and O
seated O
with O
no O
attitude O
from O
the O
host O
and O
hostess B-AS
, O
despite O
no O
reservation B-AS
. O

Food B-AS
- O
The O
cheese B-AS
plate O
contained O
flavored O
spreads O
instead O
of O
decent O
chesses O
. O

After O
arguing O
about O
this O
and O
requesting O
tap B-AS
water I-AS
instead O
of O
a O
bottled O
variety O
, O
we O
were O
exiled O
to O
customer O
Siberia O
, O
and O
the O
staff B-AS
seemed O
eager O
get O
us O
out O
of O
the O
restaurant O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
. O

The O
wait O
was O
long O
which O
is O
understandable O
but O
the O
waiters B-AS
were O
rude O
to O
us O
while O
we O
waited O
, O
rushed O
us O
to O
order O
, O
ignored O
us O
while O
we O
ate O
and O
needed O
more O
drinks B-AS
, O
and O
rushed O
us O
when O
they O
wanted O
the O
table B-AS
for O
another O
couple O
. O

That O
was O
totally O
acceptable O
and O
we O
found O
some O
great O
seats B-AS
at O
the O
bar B-AS
. O

The O
place B-AS
is O
small O
, O
the O
host O
was O
friendly O
and O
communicative O
- O
- O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
45 O
minutes O
for O
a O
table O
but O
they O
don O
' O
t O
take O
reservations B-AS
and O
clearly O
it O
' O
s O
a O
popular O
spot O
. O

The O
ices O
and O
the O
spumoni B-AS
were O
perfect O
desserts B-AS
to O
the O
pizza B-AS
. O

And O
forget O
about O
having O
a O
drink B-AS
at O
the O
bar B-AS
to O
take O
the O
edge O
off O
because O
the O
space O
between O
tables O
is O
so O
narrow O
that O
you O
' O
ll O
be O
shoved O
by O
the O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
who O
are O
desparate O
to O
get O
their O
job O
done O
. O

The O
foi B-AS
gras I-AS
empanadas I-AS
were O
OK O
- O
- O
I O
would O
try O
another O
dumpling B-AS
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
not O
the O
greatest O
, O
but O
the O
place B-AS
is O
huge O
and O
it O
has O
a O
nice O
setting B-AS
. O

Fried O
appetizers O
, O
tuna O
steak O
and O
other O
dishes B-AS
are O
also O
available O
, O
as O
well O
as O
an O
assortment O
of O
sakes O
, O
graphed O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
according O
to O
flavor O
components O
. O

First O
, O
we O
waited O
40 O
minutes O
for O
our O
food B-AS
, O
but O
after O
a O
thrity O
minute O
wait O
, O
the O
waitress B-AS
asked O
me O
to O
clarify O
what O
I O
had O
ordered O
( O
I O
ordered O
off O
their O
menu B-AS
, O
with O
no O
changes O
) O
. O

Our O
waitress B-AS
was O
rather O
un O
- O
friendly O
, O
seemed O
annoyed O
that O
we O
didn O
' O
t O
want O
appetizers B-AS
and O
we O
waited O
15 O
minutes O
before O
our O
wine O
arrived O
. O

The O
view B-AS
is O
the O
reason O
to O
go O
to O
this O
restaurant O
, O
not O
the O
food B-AS
nor O
the O
service B-AS
. O

Trish O
, O
our O
waitress B-AS
was O
really O
great O
- O
the O
food B-AS
was O
mediocre O
. O

Our O
waiter B-AS
showed O
up O
two O
minutes O
later O
to O
take O
our O
order O
and O
showed O
up O
with O
our O
drinks B-AS
25 O
minutes O
later O
and O
they O
were O
not O
crowed O
. O

The O
Food B-AS
Diners I-AS
are O
prompted O
to O
order O
several O
shareable O
dishes O
which O
, O
considering O
the O
food O
isn O
' O
t O
what O
' O
s O
drawing O
most O
of O
the O
crowd B-AS
, O
are O
surprisingly O
good O
. O

From O
chicken O
wings O
and O
smoked B-AS
beef I-AS
brisket I-AS
to O
pulled O
pork B-AS
and O
Texas O
links O
, O
the O
menu B-AS
features O
many O
barbecue O
favorites O
. O

While O
the O
bar B-AS
is O
expansive O
, O
the O
ceilings O
are O
high O
, O
the O
tables B-AS
are O
spacious O
and O
the O
plates O
are O
oversized O
, O
where O
is O
the O
food B-AS
? O

The O
space B-AS
and O
furnishings O
are O
too O
spartan O
and O
the O
service O
amateur O
and O
scattershot O
( O
no O
smiles O
offered O
here O
- O
busboy B-AS
serves O
mains O
with O
who O
gets O
the O
. O

While O
the O
appetizers B-AS
, O
entrees B-AS
, O
and O
desserts O
arrived O
in O
a O
timely O
manner O
, O
our O
water B-AS
glasses I-AS
maintained O
consistently O
empty O
( O
at O
one O
point O
one O
of O
us O
had O
to O
ask O
for O
water O
twice O
! O
) O

They O
offer O
a O
small O
but O
good O
selection O
of O
beer B-AS
and I-AS
wine I-AS
from O
India O
, O
and O
their O
cuisine B-AS
can O
please O
the O
most O
spice O
- O
averting O
palates O
of O
those O
American O
friends O
of O
yours O
who O
claim O
to O
not O
like O
Indian B-AS
food I-AS
. O

It O
' O
s O
made O
with O
cauliflower O
, O
wild B-AS
mushrooms I-AS
, O
and O
no O
rice B-AS
at O
all O
. O

By O
this O
I O
mean O
that O
the O
guy B-AS
selling I-AS
hotdogs I-AS
outside O
of O
Grand O
Central O
has O
given O
me O
better O
service B-AS
. O

Don O
' O
t O
miss O
the O
crema O
catalana O
the O
waiter B-AS
recommended O
us O
for O
dessert B-AS
. O

Yes O
it O
' O
s O
pricey O
for O
counter B-AS
service I-AS
, O
sawdust O
floors O
and O
deafening O
chatter O
but O
the O
pastrami B-AS
makes O
it O
all O
worth O
it O
. O

I O
have O
never O
had O
a O
bad O
meal B-AS
or O
service B-AS
( O
on O
a O
couple O
of O
occasions O
I O
waited O
past O
my O
reservation B-AS
time O
) O
. O

Actually O
, O
upon O
being O
seated O
in O
the B-AS
tea I-AS
room I-AS
, O
we O
weren O
' O
t O
even O
offered O
the O
tea B-AS
menus I-AS
and O
had O
to O
ask O
for O
it O
. O

Our O
waiter B-AS
didn O
' O
t O
even O
bothered O
to O
ask O
for O
dessert B-AS
. O

Delivery B-AS
wasn O
' O
t O
the O
fastest O
, O
but O
the O
food B-AS
was O
still O
hot O
so O
I O
won O
' O
t O
complain O
. O

The O
crowd B-AS
is O
not O
young O
, O
but O
hey O
, O
go O
somewhere O
else O
to O
get O
a O
drink B-AS
afterward I-AS
. O

Everything O
that O
we O
tasted O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
was O
great O
, O
particularly O
the O
shrimp B-AS
tapas I-AS
( O
if O
you O
don O
' O
t O
order O
it O
yourself O
, O
the O
waiter B-AS
will O
surely O
recommend O
it O
) O
. O

By O
the O
time O
you O
get O
to O
the O
table B-AS
, O
it O
' O
ll O
have O
been O
WELL O
worth O
the O
wait B-AS
. O

A O
lot O
of O
energy O
and O
I O
loved O
the O
actors B-AS
who O
came O
to O
our O
table B-AS
. O

For O
desset O
, O
I O
had O
Cecilia O
' O
s O
Chocolate B-AS
Marquise I-AS
served I-AS
with I-AS
vanilla I-AS
sauce I-AS
and O
crushed O
pistachios B-AS
. O

After O
ordering O
a O
good O
amount O
of O
sushi B-AS
the O
waiter B-AS
asked O
me O
if O
that O
was O
all O
I O
wanted O
. O

The O
fish O
of O
the O
day O
can O
be O
prepared O
five O
different O
ways O
according O
to O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
but O
fails O
to O
mention O
that O
those O
five O
different O
ways O
are O
just O
five O
different O
sauces B-AS
that O
come O
out O
with O
the O
whole O
, O
deep B-AS
fried I-AS
fish I-AS
. O

I O
ordered O
the O
$ O
39 O
filet B-AS
and O
ordered O
it O
medium O
and O
it O
came O
to O
the O
table O
well O
done O
and O
tasted O
like O
a O
goodyear O
tire B-AS
. O

They O
have O
a O
great O
selection B-AS
of I-AS
wines I-AS
, O
and O
have O
recently O
expanded O
with O
a O
Wine B-AS
Bar I-AS
around O
the O
corner O
that O
' O
s O
accessible O
through O
the O
main O
dining O
room O
. O

The O
only O
saving O
grace O
is O
the O
sweet B-AS
tea I-AS
- O
but O
even O
that O
isn O
' O
t O
worth O
the O
wait B-AS
. O

The O
happy O
hour O
crowd B-AS
at O
the O
bar B-AS
was O
mostly O
just O
out O
of O
worker O
blowing O
off O
steam O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
ok O
at O
best O
, O
but O
the O
service B-AS
and O
the O
uncomfortable O
accomidations O
have O
such O
a O
negetive O
effect O
, O
that O
one O
can O
only O
wonder O
why O
they O
waited O
so O
long O
for O
so O
little O
. O

For O
entrees B-AS
, O
my O
favorites O
were O
the O
coriander B-AS
and I-AS
honey I-AS
pork I-AS
ribs I-AS
or O
the O
seared O
scallops O
, O
both O
of O
which O
were O
to O
die O
for O
. O

5 O
hour B-AS
meal I-AS
( O
we O
ordered O
the O
tasting O
menu B-AS
) O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
good O
overall O
, O
but O
unremarkable O
given O
the O
price B-AS
. O

then O
, O
the O
waiter B-AS
had O
nerve O
to O
charge O
me O
for O
the O
fruit B-AS
salad I-AS
and O
bloody O
mary O
( O
which O
we O
didn O
' O
t O
drink O
) O
that O
came O
with O
the O
omelet B-AS
( O
brunch O
special O
) O
. O

The O
lobster B-AS
is O
good O
but O
over O
- O
priced O
; O
go O
for O
lunch B-AS
and O
it O
' O
s O
only O
$ O
35 O
and O
served O
prixe O
- O
fix O
with O
all O
the O
trimmings O
. O

i O
do O
agree O
with O
the O
comment O
about O
their O
waitstaff B-AS
, O
they O
tend O
to O
make O
you O
feel O
like O
you O
have O
to O
rush O
through O
your O
meal B-AS
. O

I O
only O
had O
lunch B-AS
here O
, O
but O
i O
had O
great O
shrimp B-AS
and O
a O
spectacular O
lobster B-AS
, O
and O
the O
dessert B-AS
was O
heavenly O
. O

Sure O
, O
the O
wait B-AS
was O
a O
bit O
long O
for O
a O
table O
, O
but O
the O
service O
was O
good O
and O
the O
food B-AS
was O
pretty O
good O
too O
. O

The O
food O
is O
a O
melding O
of O
Moroccan O
comfort O
food O
and O
Spanish B-AS
tapas I-AS
fare I-AS
: O
tagines O
, O
stews O
and O
salads B-AS
, O
with O
surprises O
like O
baby B-AS
eggplants I-AS
and I-AS
olives I-AS
where O
you O
might O
not O
expect O
them O
. O

tuesday O
at O
545pm O
pre B-AS
- I-AS
show I-AS
dinner I-AS
- O
great O
food B-AS
- O
amazing O
service B-AS
- O
was O
strange O
to O
find O
both O
at O
one O
place O
! O

The O
service B-AS
is O
good O
, O
but O
the O
staff B-AS
is O
not O
too O
friendly O
. O

After O
a O
show O
we O
had O
surperb O
steaks B-AS
and O
had O
cocktails B-AS
at O
the O
bar B-AS
. O

We O
approached O
the O
host B-AS
and O
manager B-AS
politely O
after O
the O
meal B-AS
but O
only O
received O
a O
simple O
and O
insincere O
Sorry O
. O

My O
best O
friend O
and O
I O
went O
to O
dinner B-AS
on O
Friday O
, O
November O
8 O
, O
2002 O
and O
we O
both O
enjoyed O
our O
meals B-AS
. O

The O
Food O
Crave O
' O
s O
two O
chefs O
have O
resumes O
that O
boast O
stints O
at O
Payard O
, O
Nobu O
and O
Industry B-AS
( O
food O
) O
, O
so O
it O
' O
s O
no O
surprise O
their O
menu B-AS
is O
full O
of O
unusual O
twists O
on O
old O
favorites O
. O

My O
friend O
' O
s O
entree B-AS
wasn O
' O
t O
presented O
as O
described O
in O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
but O
we O
didn O
' O
t O
want O
to O
add O
to O
the O
drama O
. O

The O
host B-AS
came O
by O
and O
told O
us O
that O
they O
made O
a O
mistake O
and O
would O
have O
to O
seat B-AS
us O
at O
a O
two O
- O
person O
table O
. O

Noisy O
atmosphere B-AS
makes O
the O
place B-AS
even O
more O
fun O
, O
though O
it O
may O
become O
hard O
to O
get O
in O
after O
5PM O
on O
Friday O
- O
almost O
every O
table O
would O
be O
reserved O
. O

We O
had O
to O
ask O
for O
water B-AS
multiple O
times O
, O
there O
were O
no O
paper O
towels O
in O
the O
bathroom O
and O
even O
after O
informing O
a O
staff B-AS
person O
they O
still O
were O
none O
an O
hour O
later O
. O

It O
appeared O
that O
they O
used O
a O
cheese B-AS
pizza I-AS
cooked O
earlier O
that O
day O
or O
the O
day O
before O
and O
just O
added O
the O
raw O
topping B-AS
to O
it O
, O
then O
delivered O
it O
. O

What O
a O
pleasant O
surprise O
to O
have O
found O
a O
restaurant O
where O
you O
can O
sit O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
and O
feel O
like O
a O
glamourpuss O
, O
yet O
whose O
staff B-AS
and O
even O
other O
patrons O
make O
you O
feel O
like O
you O
are O
already O
a O
family O
friend O
. O

In O
Short O
Many O
Murray O
Hill O
locals O
gladly O
overlook O
the O
dull O
green O
walls B-AS
and O
fluorescent O
lighting B-AS
for O
Jaiya O
' O
s O
quick O
and O
affordable O
Thai B-AS
cooking I-AS
- O
- O
if O
not O
, O
they O
take O
meals O
to O
go O
or O
get O
them O
delivered O
. O

When O
he O
mentioned O
that O
a O
pinot B-AS
noir I-AS
would O
be O
a O
decent O
match O
with O
two O
disparate O
plates O
of O
a O
first O
course O
( O
and O
the O
even O
further O
disparate O
second O
course O
- O
yes O
we O
informed O
him O
of O
our O
total O
meal B-AS
choices O
PRIOR O
to O
our O
wine B-AS
selection O
) O
. O

They O
had O
a O
definite O
buzz O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
, O
but O
the O
place B-AS
is O
so O
big O
that O
we O
felt O
like O
we O
had O
our O
own O
private O
room O
in O
the O
back O
. O

Food B-AS
is O
average O
, O
service B-AS
is O
awful O
, O
and O
the O
attitude O
isn O
' O
t O
New O
York O
- O
it O
' O
s O
just O
plain O
rude O
- O
and O
most O
of O
NYC O
is O
caring O
and O
courteous O
. O

We O
arrived O
at O
5 O
: O
30 O
and O
had O
leave O
at O
7 O
: O
30 O
without O
dessert O
or O
coffee O
because O
the O
kitchen B-AS
took O
insanely O
long O
between O
courses B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
abundant O
and O
good O
but O
wasn O
' O
t O
worth O
the O
unpleasant O
wait B-AS
. O

It O
says O
it O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
and O
the O
servers B-AS
explain O
it O
to O
you O
as O
soon O
as O
you O
sit O
down O
so O
I O
' O
m O
surprised O
by O
how O
many O
people O
on O
this O
site O
complain O
about O
the O
portion O
sizes B-AS
. O

The O
bar O
was O
so O
crowded O
there O
was O
no O
point O
in O
ordering B-AS
a O
drink B-AS
, O
and O
when O
we O
were O
finally O
seated O
we O
got O
no O
service B-AS
at O
all O
for O
20 O
minutes O
. O

I O
absolutely O
hate O
communal O
seating O
and O
closely O
spaced B-AS
tables I-AS
and O
this O
place O
had O
both O
, O
but O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
and O
the O
food B-AS
were O
such O
that O
I O
was O
able O
to O
get O
beyond O
the O
grumpy O
mood O
that O
put O
me O
in O
to O
have O
a O
really O
good O
experience O
. O

Our O
waitress B-AS
kept O
forgetting O
our O
drinks B-AS
. O

Although O
my O
waiter B-AS
had O
about O
as O
much O
personality O
as O
a O
dead O
fish B-AS
, O
I O
loved O
the O
great O
solid O
food B-AS
and O
would O
definately O
go O
back O
. O

The O
busboy O
kept O
our O
glasses B-AS
full O
; O
the O
waiter B-AS
warmed O
up O
to O
our O
table O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
night O
by O
cracking O
jokes O
. O

The O
Scene B-AS
The O
bruising O
thoroughfare O
that O
is O
East O
57th O
Street O
is O
the O
last O
place O
you O
' O
d O
expect O
to O
find O
an O
intimate O
, O
adorably O
decorated O
Northern O
Italian O
spot O
where O
it O
' O
s O
actually O
possible O
to O
have O
a O
quiet O
, O
pleasant O
dinner B-AS
. O

I O
love O
the O
creative O
rolls B-AS
that O
they O
have O
on O
their O
menus B-AS
, O
and O
none O
of O
them O
were O
a O
disappointment O
. O

had O
dinner B-AS
there O
last O
night O
, O
max O
the O
waiter B-AS
was O
great O
. O

Hoegardden O
on O
tap B-AS
is O
an O
added O
bonus O
if O
you O
' O
re O
not O
drinking O
from O
the O
well O
versed O
wine B-AS
menu I-AS
. O

The O
halibut B-AS
cheek I-AS
appetizer I-AS
came O
with O
a O
generous O
portion B-AS
of I-AS
foie I-AS
gras I-AS
, O
but O
that O
' O
s O
about O
the O
only O
positive O
thing O
I O
can O
say O
about O
the O
meal O
. O

We O
started O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
with O
a O
nice O
bottle B-AS
of I-AS
wine I-AS
, O
which O
was O
priced O
fairly O
and O
sampled O
several O
different O
cheeses B-AS
. O

The O
best O
out O
of O
the O
three O
entree B-AS
' O
s O
we O
had O
was O
the O
goat B-AS
cheese I-AS
ravioli I-AS
. O

I O
made O
the O
mistake O
of O
coming O
here O
with O
5 O
friends O
for O
brunch B-AS
so O
the O
wait B-AS
was O
extremely O
long O
and O
then O
we O
got O
stuck O
at O
the O
only O
table O
big O
enough O
for O
6 O
( O
downstairs O
near O
the O
bathroom O
away O
from O
all O
of O
the O
other O
patrons O
) O
so O
that O
was O
dissapointing O
but O
I O
will O
be O
back O
soon O
with O
1 O
or O
2 O
friends O
. O

While O
waiting B-AS
there O
was O
no O
room O
for O
standing O
and O
the O
bar B-AS
staff I-AS
and O
their O
drinks B-AS
were O
horrendous O
. O

We O
walked O
out O
the O
door O
with O
only O
a O
drink B-AS
in O
each O
of O
us O
and O
the O
bill B-AS
was O
still O
over O
$ O
100 O
. O

The O
owners B-AS
are O
incredibly O
nice O
too O
, O
comping O
pitchers O
of O
margaritas B-AS
if O
you O
sit O
there O
and O
eat O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
hours O
. O

Wether O
you O
want O
a O
Regular O
Slice O
, O
their O
DELICIOUS O
marinara B-AS
sicilian I-AS
, O
or O
one O
of O
their O
specialty B-AS
pizzas I-AS
like O
Chicken B-AS
Parm I-AS
, O
Ravioli B-AS
, O
or O
Taco O
pizza O
once O
you O
eat O
a O
Rosas B-AS
Pizza I-AS
you O
will O
never O
go O
anywhere O
else O
. O

This O
is O
of O
course O
after O
waiting B-AS
forever O
for O
menus B-AS
and O
eventually O
having O
to O
ask O
for O
them O
. O

As O
a O
former O
waitress B-AS
, O
I O
get O
this O
conceptually O
, O
and O
I O
am O
even O
understanding O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
I O
had O
to O
wait O
30minutes O
to O
get O
my O
first O
drink B-AS
because O
the O
bar B-AS
was O
backed O
up O
. O

Salads B-AS
are O
a O
delicious O
way O
to O
begin O
the O
meal B-AS
. O

My O
only O
complaint O
is O
waiting B-AS
a O
bit O
between O
the O
appetizer O
and O
the O
main B-AS
course I-AS
but O
it O
was O
well O
worth O
it O
. O

Additionally O
, O
one O
of O
the O
waiters B-AS
found O
it O
necessary O
to O
walk O
around O
the O
restaurant O
, O
telling O
people O
how O
to O
eat O
their O
food B-AS
. O

The O
only O
time O
the O
waitress B-AS
paid O
any O
attention O
to O
us O
was O
when O
she O
took O
our O
order O
and O
at O
the O
end O
of O
our O
meal B-AS
to O
ask O
if O
we O
wanted O
dessert B-AS
( O
by O
then O
we O
had O
already O
packed O
up O
our O
leftovers O
and O
were O
waiting O
for O
change O
from O
our O
bill O
) O
. O

They O
deliver O
and O
I O
' O
ve O
used O
their O
food B-AS
for O
quick O
executive O
type O
lunches B-AS
in O
my O
office O
. O

The O
high O
light O
was O
the O
fondue B-AS
, O
that O
we O
never O
got O
because O
again O
the O
server B-AS
said O
the O
kitchen B-AS
was O
too O
busy O
. O

Waitress O
took O
FOREVER O
to O
take O
our O
drink B-AS
order O
( O
it O
was O
not O
crowded O
) O
and O
she O
forgot O
our O
chips B-AS
guac I-AS
. O

Don O
' O
t O
miss O
the O
creamed B-AS
spinach I-AS
, O
skip O
the O
frieeees B-AS
. O

But O
the O
place B-AS
is O
so O
great O
that O
patrons O
don O
' O
t O
mind O
waiting B-AS
outside O
rather O
than O
go O
to O
another O
restaurant O
which O
you O
can O
find O
at O
least O
10 O
in O
short O
walking O
distance O
. O

The O
rice B-AS
was O
warm O
and O
didn O
' O
t O
have O
a O
hint B-AS
of O
vinegar O
. O

With O
one O
drink B-AS
each O
, O
apps O
, O
entrees B-AS
, O
and O
three O
desserts O
( O
nothing O
great O
) O
the O
bill B-AS
came O
to O
$ O
200 O
for O
four O
. O

Sure O
, O
the O
burgers B-AS
are O
good O
, O
but O
not O
good O
enough O
to O
make O
up O
for O
the O
abominable O
service O
and O
disgusting O
, O
filthy O
atmosphere B-AS
. O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
nice O
, O
food B-AS
is O
really O
worth O
it O
, O
especially O
for O
such O
prices B-AS
, O
but O
service B-AS
sucks O
: O
I O
first O
ordered O
2 O
different O
martinis B-AS
and O
never O
got O
the O
one O
I O
asked O
for O
; O
they O
brought O
the O
wrong O
dishes O
- O
although O
it O
was O
quick O
! O
- O
and O
then O
we O
had O
to O
ask O
for O
chopsticks O
to O
be O
able O
to O
eat O
our O
dishes O
. O

Our O
waiter B-AS
was O
stuffed O
with O
attitude O
and O
didn O
' O
t O
bother O
explaining O
things O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
that O
he O
clearly O
knew O
we O
could O
not O
understand O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
not O
five O
star O
but O
the O
prices B-AS
reflect O
that O
. O

This O
has O
to O
be O
the O
HUGEST O
steak B-AS
I O
' O
ve O
ever O
seen O
and O
the O
value B-AS
here O
is O
OUTRAGEOUS O
. O

Went O
to O
Brasserie O
for O
restaurant O
week O
dinner B-AS
and O
maybe O
it O
was O
the O
menu B-AS
but O
the O
food B-AS
was O
very O
bland O
and O
it O
was O
something O
that O
I O
could O
have O
eatten O
at O
home O
. O

My O
advice O
: O
go O
the O
bathroom B-AS
at O
home O
, O
and O
then O
go O
to O
Ginza O
for O
EXCELLENT O
sushi B-AS
and O
service B-AS
. O

About O
a O
half O
hour O
wait B-AS
with O
reservations B-AS
. O

We O
stumbled O
onto O
this O
diamond O
in O
the O
rough O
after O
our O
dinner B-AS
plans O
at O
Schiller O
' O
s O
were O
thwarted O
by O
a O
90 O
minute O
wait B-AS
. O

Great O
pizza B-AS
and O
heros O
, O
without O
the O
variety O
and O
selection O
of O
that O
star O
wars O
- O
style O
canteena O
hipster O
crowd O
pizzeria O
on O
Bedford O
( O
Anna O
Maria O
' O
s O
) O
but O
with O
5X O
the O
flavor B-AS
. O

45 O
minutes O
later O
our O
less O
- O
than O
- O
stellar O
pizza B-AS
and O
their O
even O
less O
- O
than O
- O
stellar O
gnoccho O
was O
dropped O
at O
the O
table B-AS
; O
no O
explanation O
or O
apology O
or O
attempt O
to O
acknowledge O
the O
ridiculous O
wait B-AS
. O

The O
Scene B-AS
Service I-AS
bustles O
through O
the O
energetic O
, O
sprawling O
space B-AS
with O
the O
precision O
of O
expert O
merengue O
dancers O
, O
and O
everyone O
else O
goes O
along O
with O
the O
flow O
suggested O
by O
the O
tall O
, O
curving O
ceilings O
. O

I O
went O
to O
Sushiden O
on O
a O
Friday O
night O
around O
8 O
: O
00 O
, O
the O
place B-AS
was O
pretty O
empty O
, O
we O
had O
reservations B-AS
, O
but O
we O
didnt O
need O
them O
. O

We O
had O
reserved O
space O
one O
one O
side O
of O
the O
bar B-AS
, O
but O
when O
the O
staff B-AS
tried O
to O
force O
the O
Pre B-AS
- I-AS
Fixe I-AS
on O
all O
15 O
members O
of O
the O
party O
to O
stay O
there O
, O
we O
moved O
to O
the O
other O
side O
( O
the O
difference O
in O
decor O
was O
minimal O
) O
. O

The O
characters B-AS
were O
very O
entertaining O
, O
and O
while O
the O
prices B-AS
are O
a O
little O
steep O
, O
it O
is O
well O
worth O
the O
cost B-AS
. O

The O
shrimps B-AS
looked O
old O
and O
had O
a O
sheen O
to O
them O
that O
you O
see O
at O
an O
all O
you O
can O
eat O
buffet B-AS
at O
Sizzler O
. O

Chino O
' O
s O
has O
become O
my O
new O
regular O
Lunch B-AS
spot O
after O
trying O
their O
awesome O
pork B-AS
sandwhich I-AS
and O
calamari B-AS
salad I-AS
. O

Don O
' O
t O
let O
the O
all O
- O
Italian O
menu B-AS
intimidate O
; O
the O
waitstaff B-AS
patiently O
translates O
each O
item O
. O

Good O
food B-AS
, O
but O
they O
could O
expand O
their O
desert O
menu B-AS
. O

Panini B-AS
or O
pizzettes O
loaded O
with O
fresh O
Italian O
ingredients B-AS
such O
as O
prosciutto B-AS
, O
mozzarella B-AS
and O
artichokes O
make O
it O
worth O
staying O
for O
dinner B-AS
. O

Mushroom B-AS
appetizer I-AS
was O
doused O
in O
a O
gross B-AS
mayonnaise I-AS
like I-AS
sauce I-AS
and O
had O
not O
been O
described O
that O
way O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
. O

Nonetheless O
, O
our O
waiter B-AS
gave O
us O
prompt O
service B-AS
and O
a O
smile O
every O
time O
he O
came O
over O
to O
take O
an O
order O
, O
bring O
us O
drinks B-AS
, O
or O
check O
up O
on O
how O
we O
were O
doing O
. O

A O
bright O
spot O
: O
the O
server B-AS
was O
immeadiately O
apologetic O
and O
whisked O
problem O
plates B-AS
away O
, O
and O
replacements O
were O
prompt O
. O

We O
waited O
FOREVER O
for O
a O
table B-AS
and O
when O
the O
appetizers B-AS
arrived O
they O
were O
cold O
or O
frozen O
in O
the O
middle O
! O

The O
Food O
Mafrici O
' O
s O
approach O
to O
modern O
Italian O
fare O
may O
seem O
gimmicky O
: O
The O
menu B-AS
lists O
eight O
seasonal O
ingredients B-AS
, O
each O
prepared O
as O
an O
appetizer O
, O
pasta B-AS
and O
entree O
. O

The O
portions O
are O
miniscule O
- O
- O
a O
pasta O
entree O
was O
the O
size O
of O
a O
small O
appetizer B-AS
, O
we O
were O
all O
hungry O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
meal B-AS
but O
they O
certainly O
supersize O
the O
prices B-AS
. O

The O
ambience B-AS
is O
diner O
- O
like O
and O
the O

staff I-AS

rushed O
, O
but O
at O
these O
prices B-AS
, O
I O
can O
' O
t O
complain O
. O

A O
sushi B-AS
chef I-AS
creating O

that O
will O
have O
you O
talking O

The O
Scene B-AS
This O
vintage O
Cuban O
diner B-AS
, O
with O
white B-AS
acrylic I-AS
tables I-AS
, O
soft O
Spanish B-AS
music I-AS
humming O
pleasantly O
in O
the O
background O
and O
regulars O
casually O
hugging O
the O
counter O
, O
serves O
some O
of O
the O
cheapest O
, O
tastiest O
fare O
in O
the O
area O
. O

In O
Short O
The O
weathered O
bar B-AS
, O
well O
- O
worn O
tables B-AS
, O
and O
chipped O
black O
paint O
on O
the O
walls O
give O
this O
corner O
tavern O
a O
lived O
- O
in O
feel O
. O

The O
bartender O
was O
skilled O
, O
the O
owners B-AS
were O
very O
friendly O
, O
but O
the O
wait B-AS
for O
my O
burrito B-AS
was O
longer O
than O
I O
would O
have O
liked O
. O

The O
Food B-AS
In O
a O
less O
- O
than O
- O
booming O
economy O
, O
it O
' O
s O
a O
joy O
to O
find O
an O
East O
Village O
bistro O
with O
entrees B-AS
that O
rarely O
top O
15 O
bucks O
. O

our O
waitress B-AS
finally O
made O
time O
to O
take O
our O
order O
- O
bread B-AS
was O
never O
brought O
, O
water O
never O
refilled B-AS
and O
wine B-AS
never O
got O
to O
be O
ordered O
- O
had O
to O
ask O
for O
everything O
ourselves O
. O

Though O
the O
crowd B-AS
is O
a O
bit O
more O
mature O
than O
a O
typical O
New O
York O
hot O
spot B-AS
, O
if O
you O
are O
looking O
to O
impress O
a O
classy O
woman O
, O
look O
know O
further O
. O

the O
service B-AS
is O
so O
- O
so O
; O
our O
waiter B-AS
told O
us O
there O
was O
a O
table B-AS
for O
us O
, O
then O
took O
us O
back O
to O
the O
entrance O
, O
we O
then O
waited O
another O
fifteen O
minutes O
- O
confusion O
seems O
to O
reign O
. O

The O
desserts B-AS
were O
both O
essentially O
the O
same O
, O
and O
the O
service B-AS
was O
on O
the O
slow O
side O
. O

Lastly O
the O
waiters B-AS
and O
bartender B-AS
should O
learn O
to O
have O
argurments O
in O
private B-AS
and O
not O
in O
front O
of O
customers O
. O

Sometimes O
service B-AS
was O
a O
bit O
slow O
, O
and O
we O
had O
to O
ask O
for O
salads B-AS
, O
water B-AS
, O
etc O
a O
couple O
of O
times O
, O
but O
this O
was O
all O
done O
with O
good O
humor O
and O
no O
resentment O
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
, O
who O
was O
missing O
when O
we O
wanted O
to O
place O
our O
order O
, O
hovered O
over O
us O
throughout O
the O
meal B-AS
, O
as O
if O
in O
a O
hurry O
to O
get O
us O
out O
of O
there O
. O

you O
go O
all O
out O
with O
dress B-AS
, O
tastes O
, O
and O
performance O
, O
and O
in O
the O
end O
its O
really O
about O
having O
a O
good O
time O
where O
you O
truly O
indulge O
yoursef O
in O
good O
vodka B-AS
, O
compnay O
, O
music B-AS
, O
and O
food B-AS
. O

Also O
, O
the O
waiter B-AS
wrongly O
described O
a O
wine B-AS
I O
had O
inquired O
about O
causing O
the O
sommelier O
to O
have O
to O
make O
a O
trip O
to O
the O
table O
to O
offer O
an O
alternate O
recommendation O
. O

We O
' O
ve O
been O
staying O
in O
a O
hotel O
and O
Burger O
Heaven O
has O
delievered O
quite O
a O
few O
meals B-AS
for O
us O
which O
is O
100 O
% O
better O
than O
the O
hotel O
food B-AS
. O

I O
had O
six O
different O
items O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
( O
yes O
, O
I O
am O
a O
trencherman O
) O
and O
three O
were O
simply O
OUTSTANDING O
: O
the O
steak B-AS
, O
the O
sweetbreads O
( O
best O
I O
' O
ve O
ever O
had O
) O
, O
and O
the O
monkfish B-AS
liver I-AS
( O
also O
the O
best O
I O
' O
ve O
ever O
had O
) O
. O

We O
had O
a O
sit O
down O
dinner B-AS
and O
cannot O
tell O
you O
how O
satisfied O
I O
was O
with O
the O
quality O
of O
service B-AS
and O
food B-AS
. O

Intimate O
dinner B-AS
upstairs O
, O
dessert B-AS
on O
the O
sidewalk O
as O
you O
take O
in O
all O
the O
nuisance O
of O
New O
York O
City O
living O
are O
experiences O
that O
give O
a O
feeling O
you O
are O
doing O
much O
more O
than O
just O
dining O
out O
. O

The O
bar O
downstairs O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
fun O
, O
so O
if O
you O
get O
stuck O
waiting B-AS
, O
just O
have O
drink B-AS
. O

My O
snack O
was O
fava B-AS
bean I-AS
hummus I-AS
chips I-AS
which O
was O
the O
perfect O
amount O
to O
hold O
me O
til O
dinner B-AS
. O

) O
, O
but O
our O
waiter B-AS
was O
had O
a O
horrible O
attitude O
, O
couldn O
' O
t O
remember O
to O
bring O
lemon O
for O
our O
water O
, O
or O
soy B-AS
sauce I-AS
for O
our O
sushi B-AS
rolls I-AS
, O
the O
food B-AS
was O
wonderful O
, O
but O
unfortunately O
the O
service O
ruined O
our O
visit O
. O

The O
ONLY O
negative O
was O
when O
we O
asked O
the O
waiter B-AS
to O
secretly O
bring O
birthday O
cake O
and O
some O
other O
desserts O
for O
the O
table B-AS
. O

Charging O
full O
price B-AS
for O
half B-AS
pie I-AS
toppings I-AS
, O
and O
refusing O
delivery O
( O
1 O
block O
) O
for O
orders O
under O
$ O
20 O
. O

Our O
waiter B-AS
was O
well O
versed O
with O
the O
menu O
and O
provided O
us O
with O
great O
service B-AS
, O
he O
didn O
' O
t O
hover O
over O
the O
table B-AS
as O
some O
servers O
tend O
to O
do O
in O
high O
end O
restaurants O
. O

I O
also O
do O
not O
think O
waiters B-AS
there O
are O
rude O
- O
yes O
there O
are O
not O
friendly O
and O
chatty O
, O
but O
do O
provide O
great O
service B-AS
. O

if O
you O
do O
though O
just O
wait O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
( O
yummy O
drinks B-AS
! O

I O
was O
really O
excited O
when O
our O
waiter B-AS
read O
off O
the O
list O
of O
specials B-AS
. O

At O
least O
you O
have O
the O
ambiance B-AS
and O
lovely O
live B-AS
piano O
musice O
being O
played O
for O
you O
while O
you O
wait O
. O

we O
completed O
our O
cocktails B-AS
long O
before O
the O
waiter B-AS
brought O
our O
starters O
( O
which O
did O
not O
come O
until O
30 O
minutes O
after O
we O
had O
been O
seated O
) O
. O

We O
did O
not O
have O
reservations B-AS
so O
we O
sat O
at O
the O
small O
bar O
with O
the O
friendly O
bartender B-AS
for O
10 O
minutes O
. O

After O
waiting B-AS
40 O
minutes O
for O
a O
table B-AS
and O
30 O
+ O
for O
our O
entrees B-AS
, O
our O
waiter B-AS
was O
distracted O
. O

My O
only O
complaints O
are O
the O
less O
spectacular O
sides B-AS
and O
menu B-AS
items O
other O
than O
steak B-AS
. O

The O
waiters B-AS
are O
sometimes O
grouchy O
and O
the O
decor B-AS
doesn O
' O
t O
change O
, O
but O
the O
food B-AS
is O
always O
delicious O
and O
satisfying O
. O

Be O
warned O
though O
, O
this O
plaice O
gets O
packed O
at O
lunch B-AS
- O
and O
the O
service B-AS
can O
be O
rottenly O
slow O
- O
going O
. O

The O
Scene B-AS
North O
Square O
' O
s O
discreet O
, O
sedate O
decor B-AS
appeals O
to O
the O
largley O
older O
crowd B-AS
occupying O
the O
dining O
room O
whilst O
a O
younger O
set O
parties O
in O
the O
back O
bar B-AS
. O

We O
were O
never O
offered O
dessert B-AS
because O
our O
waiter B-AS
spent O
about O
20 O
minutes O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
calculating O
the O
checks O
instead O
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
poured O
our O
wine O
into O
my O
water B-AS
glass I-AS
, O
rolled O
his O
eyes O
when O
I O
asked O
for O
a O
new O
water O
, O
and O
definitely O
didn O
' O
t O
offer O
to O
comp O
the O
wasted O
glass B-AS
of I-AS
wine I-AS
. O

The O
actors B-AS
try O
to O
draw O
your O
attention O
away O
from O
the O
better O
stuff B-AS
that O
is O
happening O
below O
. O

for O
ANYONE O
to O
come O
and O
take O
our O
dessert B-AS
order O
( O
we O
had O
previously O
seen O
our O
waitress B-AS
going O
outside O
for O
a O
cigarette O
break O
and O
never O
coming O
back O
) O
. O

food B-AS
was O
just O
ok O
, O
, O
to O
many O
high O
end O
places O
in O
such O
a O
cool O
lower O
east O
side O
neighborhood O
, O
like O
prune O
and O
apizz O
, O
prices B-AS
to O
high O
in O
these O
places O
for O
this O
hood O
. O

The O
rest O
of O
the O
meal O
was O
good O
, O
but O
a O
little O
over O
priced B-AS
for O
Chinese O
take O
out O
style O
food B-AS
. O

Went O
to O
Spice O
Restaurant O
for O
dinner B-AS
and O
loved O
my O
meal B-AS
. O

I O
am O
not O
one O
to O
waste O
dessert B-AS
but O
we O
threw O
away O
the O
box B-AS
after O
taking O
a O
few O
bites O
of O
it O
. O

The O
waitstaff B-AS
chatted O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
amongst O
themselves O
and O
completely O
ignored O
us O
for O
the O
entire O
meal O
- O
- O
which O
took O
some O
work O
, O
as O
the O
place O
is O
small O
enough O
with O
the O
garden B-AS
closed O
! O

never O
had O
a O
bad O
pizza B-AS
, O
the O
staff B-AS
has O
always O
been O
friendly O
, O
if O
not O
overly O
solicitous O
, O
and O
the O
only O
downside O
is O
the O
occasional O
wait B-AS
on O
line O
outside O
. O

Well O
, O
no O
secret O
that O
a O
brunch B-AS
here O
on O
Saturday O
or O
Sunday O
will O
be O
a O
long O
wait B-AS
- O
but O
once O
you O
bite O
into O
those O
pancakes B-AS
, O
it O
will O
have O
been O
worth O
every O
minute O
. O

He O
hooted O
and O
hollered O
- O
- O
and O
told O
every O
staff B-AS
person O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
, O
not O
to O
serve O
us O
. O

I O
went O
for O
lunch B-AS
yesterday O
and O
had O
a O
lovely O
time B-AS
. O

The O
decor B-AS
has O
not O
quite O
made O
the O
transition O
- O
- O
some O
really O
nice O
artifacts B-AS
are O
still O
there O
, O
but O
there O
are O
several O
layers O
of O
different O
remodeling O
efforts O
visible O
. O

While O
the O
food B-AS
is O
terrific O
, O
you O
must O
overlook O
the O
often O
apathetic O
service B-AS
, O
and O
the O
sometimes O
downright O
rude O
Manager O
that O
seats O
people O
. O

When O
we O
got O
up O
to O
leave O
and O
the O
waiter B-AS
tried O
to O
charge O
us O
18 O
% O
for O
the O
two O
mediocre O
apetizers B-AS
and O
one O
drink B-AS
they O
did O
serve O
us O
. O

They O
later O
told O
us O
that O
our O
waiter B-AS
had O
to O
fix O
the O
' O
computer O
' O
- O
that O
was O
the O
reason O
he O
couldn O
' O
t O
bring O
us O
our O
drinks B-AS
. O

Thin O
crust B-AS
, O
lots O
of O
sauce O
and O
very O
little O
cheese O
, O
it O
' O
s O
not O
your O
typical O
Sicilian B-AS
slice I-AS
of I-AS
pizza I-AS
, O
but O
can O
' O
t O
explain O
why O
I O
have O
a O
hard O
time O
eating O
less O
than O
4 O
of O
those O
babies O
! O

Basically O
the O
comfort B-AS
is O
lacking O
but O
the O
food B-AS
is O
the O
focus O
. O

After O
the O
wine B-AS
experience O
, O
I O
actually O
expected O
worse O
than O
what O
was O
served B-AS
. O

Patrons B-AS
are O
a O
mix O
of O
pre B-AS
- I-AS
theater I-AS
and O
local O
regulars O
whose O
relaxed O
laughter O
and O
gesturing O
conversations O
add O
much O
to O
the O
restaurant O
' O
s O
flavor B-AS
. O

The O
manager B-AS
came O
over O
to O
our O
table O
at O
the O
end O
of O
our O
entree B-AS
course O
to O
get O
our O
review O
. O

I O
let O
the O
waiter B-AS
know O
and O
he O
offered O
me O
a O
free O
dessert B-AS
. O

The O
Food B-AS
Despite O
the O
restaurant O
' O
s O
name O
, O
the O
menu B-AS
is O
remarkably O
Atkins O
- O
friendly O
, O
from O
the O
nibble O
bowls B-AS
of O
spicy O
fried O
chickpeas O
to O
the O
grilled O
slabs O
of O
salt O
- O
flecked O
, O
smoky O
rib O
- O
eye O
, O
succulent O
chunks O
of O
rosemary B-AS
roast I-AS
chicken I-AS
and O
fat O
tubes O
of O
springy B-AS
grilled I-AS
squid I-AS
. O

If O
she O
was O
a O
bit O
more O
sophisticated O
, O
she O
wouldn O
' O
t O
have O
been O
impressed O
with O
the O
list B-AS
, O
but O
rather O
with O
the O
clientele O
and O
atmosphere B-AS
. O

The O
raw O
bar B-AS
that O
we O
were O
served B-AS
was O
abyssmal O
, O
and O
our O
dinners B-AS
of I-AS
salmon I-AS
( O
mine O
overcooked O
) O
and O
chicken B-AS
( O
hers O
, O
very O
bland O
) O
weren O
' O
t O
much O
better O
. O

I O
' O
d O
say O
the O
menu B-AS
is O
generally O
below O
- O
average O
for O
the O
neighborhood O
, O
but O
if O
you O
want O
a O
burger B-AS
, O
this O
is O
the O
place O
to O
go O
. O

The O
porterhouse O
is O
as O
good O
a O
steak B-AS
you O
are O
going O
to O
find O
in O
NYC O
or O
the O
surrounding O
area B-AS
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
was O
not O
attentive O
he O
gave O
me O
the O
wrong O
drink O
twice O
and O
the O
bill O
for O
three O
people O
who O
had O
appertizers O
, O
a O
drink O
and O
an O
entree B-AS
was O
$ O
200 O
. O

I O
didn O
' O
t O
realize O
how O
good O
the O
food B-AS
was O
until O
I O
went O
for O
dinner B-AS
the O
other O
night O
. O

A O
dining B-AS
beacon O
in O
an O
otherwise O
residential O
4 O
or O
5 O
block O
radius O
, O
Sorrel O
pleases O
on O
every O
course O

- O
from O
the O
cold O
spicy O
tomato B-AS
soup I-AS
and O
beet B-AS
salad I-AS

to O
the O
delectable O

and I-AS
- I-AS
caramel I-AS

so O
bad O
with O

) O
. O

The O
Scene O
The O
bright O
mix B-AS
of O
colors O
painted O
on O
the O
cafe O
' O
s O
walls O
matches O
the O
vivid O
margaritas O
that O
sit O
on O
nearly O
every O
table O
and O
litter O
the O
sceney O
bar B-AS
. O

At O
best O
, O
it O
' O
s O
a O
mediocre O
restaurant O
, O
forget O
about O
the O
fish O
variety O
, O
I O
asked O
for O
Char O
( O
A O
sushi B-AS
staple O
) O
, O
and O
received O
a O
blank O
look O
from O
the O
waiter B-AS
, O
same O
fish O
here O
as O
any O
grocery O
store O
. O

Didn O
' O
t O
like O
having O
to O
flag O
down O
waiters B-AS
for O
drinks B-AS
, O
nor O
having O
to O
wait O
almost O
15 O
minutes O
for O
a O
check O
after O
asking O
two O
servers B-AS
. O

The O
bar B-AS
' O
s O
waitresses B-AS
seem O
to O
have O
a O
sixth O
sense O
for O
when O
customers O
have O
reached O
the O
bottom O
of O
a O
drink B-AS
or O
are O
scratching O
their O
forks O
against O
empty O
plates O
. O

Just O
walking O
past O
this O
establishment O
during O
dinner B-AS
hours O
will O
make O
you O
dream O
of O
garlic B-AS

sauce I-AS
covering O
a O
tender O

cutlet I-AS
. O

The O
place B-AS
was O
bustling O
at O
8 O
: O
30pm O
on O
a O
Wednesday O
night O
- O
we O
arrived O
earlier O
than O
our O
reservation B-AS
and O
got O
situated O
at O
the O
bar O
. O

Later O
two O
waiters B-AS
decided O
to O
bodyguard O
our O
table B-AS
; O
when O
my O
fork O
hits O
the O
plate O
it O
' O
s O
snatched O
away O
. O

Drinks B-AS
were O
well O
priced B-AS
and O
the O
buyback O
rate O
was O
fantastic O
. O

However O
when O
I O
returned O
to O
my O
table B-AS
the O
waiter B-AS
immediately O
came O
over O
and O
said O
So O
I O
guess O
we O
are O
celebrating O
a O
birthday O
here O
. O

I O
spent O
more O
time O
looking O
for O
a O
waiter B-AS
than O
I O
did O
enjoying O
my O
meal B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
simple O
but O
exploded O
with O
flavor B-AS
and O
the O
presentation B-AS
was O
as O
if O
it O
was O
out O
of O
a O
cook O
book O
. O

After O
arriving O
for O
a O
pre O
- O
theatre O
reservation O
to O
find O
the O
kitchen O
closed O
due O
to O
a O
mechanical O
failure O
, O
the O
problem O
was O
fixed O
an O
hour O
later O
( O
after O
many O
drinks O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
, O
none O
of O
which O
management B-AS
offered O
as O
a O
concession O
to O
the O
wait B-AS
) O
and O
we O
were O
served B-AS
a O
very O
good O
dinner B-AS
in O
time O
to O
make O
the O
play O
. O

Brunch B-AS
at O
Cafe O
des O
Artistes O
was O
hands O
down O
the O
most O
terrible O
dining B-AS
experience O
I O
have O
had O
in O
New O
York O
. O

Got O
the O
check O
tossed O
on O
table O
10 O
minutes O
after O
being O
served B-AS
and O
hostess B-AS
came O
by O
to O
rush O
us O
some O
more O
. O

i O
always O
get O
the O
apple B-AS
pie I-AS
, O
but O
the O
past O
two O
times O
i O
visited O
, O
the O
waiter B-AS
burnt O
the O
pie O
while O
he O
was O
supposed O
to O
warm O
it O
up O
. O

Sometimes O
, O
the O
take B-AS
- I-AS
out I-AS
and O
seating B-AS
lines I-AS
can O
be O
long O
, O
but O
the O
staff B-AS
help O
move O
things O
along O
. O

My O
favorite O
was O
the O
apple B-AS
dessert I-AS
, O
which O
came O
with O
little O
squares O
of O
pear O
and O
apple B-AS
jelly I-AS
. O

The O
Food B-AS
An O
ideal O
meal B-AS
here O
starts O
with O
lusty O
, O
cheese O
- O
encrusted O
onion O
soup O
or O
a O
salad B-AS
of I-AS
frisee I-AS
and O
bacon O
capped O
with O
a O
soft O
- O
poached O
egg O
. O

calle B-AS
ocho O
is O
definitely O
high O
on O
my O
list O
, O
the O
food B-AS
and O
mojitos B-AS
are O
excellent O
( O
the O
sangria O
is O
a O
miss O
, O
flor O
de O
sol O
has O
much O
better O
sangria O
) O
but O
the O
service B-AS
leaves O
much O
to O
be O
desired O
. O

Entree B-AS
choices O
seem O
endless O
- O
- O
braised B-AS
beef I-AS
, O
pounded B-AS
chicken I-AS
, O
garlic B-AS
shrimp I-AS
, O
poblano O

- O
the O
platter O
of O
subtly O
spiced O
pulled O
pork O
, O
served B-AS
with I-AS
whipped I-AS
plaintains I-AS
, O
is O
the O
restaurant O
' O
s O
best O
. O

Order O
ended O
up O
being O
double O
the O
price B-AS
of O
a O
normal O
lunch B-AS
. O

I O
must O
admit O
that O
when O
my O
friend O
said O
we O
were O
going O
to O
Astoria O
for O
dinner B-AS
, O
I O
expected O
a O
diner B-AS
sytle O
restaurant O
, O
where O
the O
decor B-AS
, O
food O
and O
service O
would O
not O
suffice O
. O

But O
, O
as O
I O
said O
, O
it O
' O
s O
a O
dive O
bar B-AS
, O
so O
it O
' O
s O
not O
someplace O
you O
' O
d O
take O
a O
high O
- O
maintenance O
individual B-AS
. O

The O
service B-AS
is O
disorganised O
, O
no O
one O
gave O
us O
a O
menu B-AS
for O
15 O
mins O
once O
we O
were O
seated O
, O
but O
after O
that O
it O
went O
smoothly O
enough O
but O
no O
where O
near O
the O
stella O
performance O
of O
many O
half O
as O
pretensious O
restaurants O
. O

For O
appetizers B-AS
try O
the O
tuna B-AS
carpaccio I-AS
with I-AS
wasabi I-AS
creme I-AS
fraiche I-AS
, O
lobster B-AS
tempura I-AS
with I-AS
tarter I-AS
sauce I-AS
. O

For O
$ O
19 O
in O
a O
place O
that O
specializes O
in O
breakfast B-AS
I O
did O
expect O
perfect O
eggs B-AS
benedict I-AS
. O

I O
have O
lived O
in O
Japan O
for O
7 O
years O
and O
the O
taste B-AS
of O
the O
food B-AS
and O
the O
feel B-AS
of O
the O
restaurant O
is O
like O
being O
back O
in O
Japan O
. O

When O
the O
group O
arrived O
for O
the O
Noon B-AS
lunch I-AS
the O
restaurant O
was O
only O
partially O
set O
up O
and O
the O
group O
was O
forced O
to O
eat O
lunch O
while O
the O
staff B-AS
noisily O
set O
up O
the O
restaurant O
around O
them O
. O

If O
you O
think O
the O
prices B-AS
are O
outrageous O
, O
just O
take O
the O
family B-AS
, O
enjoy O
the O
ride O
and O
go O
in O
and O
order O
a O
few O
appetizers O
as O
prelude O
to O
a O
real O
dinner O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
friendly O
, O
but O
not O
terribly O
attentive O
, O
took O
30 O
minutes O
after O
dinner B-AS
to O
clear O
our O
plates B-AS
, O
and O
another O
20 O
to O
get O
our O
check O
. O

I O
was O
NOT O
told O
this O
before O
when O
I O
made O
the O
reservation B-AS
and O
explained O
to O
the O
manager B-AS
RICHARD O
who O
has O
the O
poorest O
customer O
service B-AS
ever O
and O
rude O
and O
said O
he O
didn O
' O
t O
believe O
me O
. O

Only O
problem O
was O
- O
an O
older O
gentleman B-AS
( O
well O
- O
dressed O
but O
a O
little O
enebriated O
) O
chose O
to O
sit O
down O
right O
next O
to O
me O
- O
despite O
the O
fact O
that O
all O
15 O
other O
seats B-AS
were O
free O
- O
order O
himself O
a O
martini B-AS
, O
and O
then O
describe O
how O
dry O
and O
dissapointing O
the O
burger O
was O
when O
he O
ordered O
it O
a O
few O
days O
ago O
. O

the O
only O
things O
u O
could O
really O
taste O
are O
the O
very O
salty O
soy B-AS
sauce I-AS
( O
even O
its O
low O
sodium O
) O
, O
the O
vinegar O
- O
soaked O
rice O
, O
and O
the O
scallion B-AS
on O
top O
of O
the O
fish O
. O

Desserts B-AS
are O
showstoppers O
, O
namely O
the O
caramelized O
banana O
tower O
with O
toasted O
marshmallows O
in O
a O
tall O
hazelnut O
shell B-AS
. O

I O
have O
to O
agree O
with O
the O
previous O
review O
that O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
isn O
' O
t O
much O
, O
but O
Mister O
Falafel B-AS
can O
' O
t O
be O
beat O
for O
quick O
, O
delicious O
, O
cheap O
takeout O
. O

the O
place B-AS
looks O
cool O
, O
but O
the O
food B-AS
is O
not O
really O
that O
good O
. O

Its O
a O
sicilian B-AS
slice I-AS
made O
with O
freshly O
grilled B-AS
veggies I-AS
which O
lie O
on O
top O
of O
a O
sumptous O
tomato O
sauce O
. O

Overall O
, O
the O
food B-AS
makes O
up O
for O
what O
is O
missing O
in O
the O
ambience B-AS
and O
service B-AS
. O

I O
really O
like O
the O
decor B-AS
and O
it O
made O
it O
feel O
like O
I O
was O
having O
drinks B-AS
at O
a O
mansion O
. O

Best O
steak B-AS
i O
have O
ever O
tasted O
in O
my O
life O
, O
the O
side B-AS
dishes I-AS
are O
amazing O
as O
well O
as O
the O
bread B-AS
basket O
they O
put O
out O
that O
could O
be O
a O
meal B-AS
in O
its O
self O
. O

The O
portions B-AS
are O
miniscule O
and O
the O
size O
of O
an O
entree B-AS
could O
be O
half O
- O
and O
appetizer B-AS
if O
even O
that O
large O
. O

Our O
waiter B-AS
disappeared O
entirely O
, O
our O
food B-AS
, O
when O
we O
were O
finally O
able O
to O
order O
it O
, O
arrived O
without O
plates B-AS
( O
we O
had O
to O
go O
and O
track O
down O
a O
busboy O
to O
get O
them O
) O
, O
and O
when O
we O
were O
finished O
, O
we O
couldn O
' O
t O
get O
the O
check B-AS
, O
even O
after O
walking O
across O
the O
restaurant O
to O
request O
it O
. O

There O
is O
actually O
space B-AS
to O
breathe O
and O
the O
decor B-AS
sets O
the O
tone O
for O
an O
intimate O
dinner B-AS
. O

I O
' O
ve O
been O
accustomed O
by O
the O
restaurant O
group O
' O
s O
great O
service B-AS
, O
so O
I O
was O
disappointed O
by O
the O
long O
wait B-AS
for O
my O
lunch O
. O

After O
making O
reservations B-AS
almost O
a O
month O
in O
advance O
, O
I O
was O
very O
disappointed O
to O
be O
seated B-AS
in O
a O
secluded O
area O
for O
dinner O
next O
to O
the O
sushi B-AS
bar I-AS
and O
KITCHEN O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O

The O
brightly O
- O
lit O
takeout B-AS
spot I-AS
with O
a O
few O
non O
- O
descript O
tables B-AS
and O
chairs O
looks O
like O
any O
other O
, O
but O
it O
tastes O
ten O
times O
more O
homespun O
. O

The O
owner B-AS
and O
staff B-AS
are O
all O
Japanese O
as O
well O
and O
that O
adds O
to O
the O
entire O
ambiance B-AS
. O

you O
may O
have O
to O
wait O
a O
bit O
for O
service B-AS
but O
you O
will O
not O
be O
disappointed O
with O
the O
food B-AS
. O

I O
dined O
there O
on O
a O
Wednesday O
night O
, O
the O
restaurant O
was O
practically O
empty O
, O
and O
we O
had O
to O
ask O
our O
waiter B-AS
for O
everything O
, O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
more O
water B-AS
, O
the O
check O
, O
etc O
. O

I O
had O
dinner B-AS
with O
a O
few O
of O
my O
friends O
, O
and O
it O
was O
the O
best O
we O
' O
ve O
had O
in O
a O
long O
time B-AS
. O

Though O
you O
will O
undoubtedly O
be O
seated O
at O
a O
table B-AS
with O
what O
seems O
like O
barely O
enough O
room B-AS
( O
no O
matter O
what O
the O
size O
of O
your O
party O
) O
, O
the O
warm O
atomosphere O
is O
worth O
the O
cramped O
quarters O
- O
you O
' O
ll O
have O
fun O
and O
forgot O
about O
the O
tight O
spot B-AS
you O
' O
re O
in O
. O

Free O
edamame B-AS
( O
nice O
perk O
) O
and O
we O
ordered O
four O
rolls B-AS
between O
the O
two O
of O
us O
, O
and O
each O
of O
us O
had O
a O
drink B-AS
. O

but O
the O
wait B-AS
for O
seating B-AS
can O
be O
exasperating O
. O

Sometimes O
when O
I O
come O
home O
from O
work O
I O
stop O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
to O
have O
a O
plate B-AS
of I-AS
oysters I-AS
and O
something O
delicious O
for O
dinner B-AS
. O

While O
the O
space O
is O
exceptionally O
small O
and O
the O
seating B-AS
can O
be O
uncomfortable O
, O
the O
food B-AS
is O
well O
worth O
the O
few O
inconveniences O
. O

The O
service B-AS
is O
excellent O
and O
always O
informative O
without O
an O
air B-AS
. O

I O
had O
afternoon B-AS
tea I-AS
which O
featured O
a O
pot B-AS
of I-AS
tea I-AS
and O
several O
pastries B-AS
and O
tea B-AS
sandwiches I-AS
, O
all O
of O
which O
were O
delicious O
. O

After O
the O
bar B-AS
, O
they O
sat O
us O
on O
the O
side O
with O
the O
wine O
room O
with O
a O
nice O
view B-AS
of O
everything O
. O

The O
waitress B-AS
interrupted O
us O
halfway O
through O
our O
meal B-AS
to O
say O
that O
if O
we O
wanted O
dessert B-AS
we O
had O
to O
order O
it O
then O
, O
because O
the O
kitchen O
wanted O
to O
close O
. O

Yet O
the O
maitre B-AS
d O
still O
sat O
us O
next O
to O
the O
bar B-AS
. O

Lobster B-AS
bisque I-AS
is O
a O
10 O
+ O
and O
Steaks B-AS
; O
fish B-AS
and I-AS
cajun I-AS
shrimp I-AS
app I-AS
are O
standouts O
! O

A O
few O
of O
us O
went O
the O
other O
night O
for O
cocktails B-AS
( O
half O
price B-AS
! O
) O

I O
went O
on O
a O
saturday O
and O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
was O
no O
more O
exciting O
than O
eating O
dinner B-AS
at O
home O
. O

The O
staff B-AS
treated O
them O
like O
true O
royalty B-AS
. O

The O
salad B-AS
I O
received O
was O
Iceberg B-AS
lettuce I-AS
with O
nothing O
else O
in O
it O
( O
no O
tomatoes O
, O
carrots B-AS
) O
. O

The O
dinner B-AS
lasted O
about O
3 O
hours O
, O
that O
waiter B-AS
continued O
to O
refill O
our O
water O
even O
though O
we O
finished O
the O
whole O
meal B-AS
( O
including O
desserts B-AS
) O
an O
hour O
and O
half O
before O
. O

And O
the O
owner B-AS
didnt O
seem O
to O
care O
, O
she O
was O
more O
interested O
in O
talking O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
than O
hearing O
from O
me O
. O

Food B-AS
was O
good O
, O
but O
not O
worth O
the O
wait B-AS
. O

I O
went O
there O
for O
Easter O
Dinner B-AS
and O
the O
pork B-AS
chops I-AS
were O
quite O
tasty O
. O

The O
ribs B-AS
are O
a O
second O
runner O
up O
, O
poo O
poo B-AS
platters I-AS
are O
never O
out O
of O
style O
. O

If O
you O
want O
peace O
quiet O
, O
ambience B-AS
and O
patient O
service B-AS
, O
go O
elsewhere O
. O

Their O
appetizer B-AS
portions I-AS
are O
not O
huge O
, O
just O
right O
since O
the O
entrees B-AS
are O
much O
larger O
. O

i O
took O
another O
45 O
minutes O
so O
i O
called O
back O
the O
waiter B-AS
and O
said O
that O
if O
the O
food B-AS
was O
ready O
now O
ill O
just O
pay O
for O
it O
. O

The O
bar B-AS
is O
also O
a O
must O
after O
dinner B-AS
: O
have O
a O
raspberry B-AS
martini I-AS
! O

the O
food B-AS
tastes O
like O
home O
cooking B-AS
. O

There O
is O
no O
way O
the O
food B-AS
and O
service O
here O
are O
worth O
the O
prices B-AS
they O
charge O
. O

Meal B-AS
was O
acceptable O
, O
Lamb B-AS
was O
tough O
although O
rare O
like O
I O
asked O
, O
green O
beans O
were O
overcooked O
, O
my O
girlfriend O
ordered O
steak B-AS
frites I-AS
rare O
, O
came O
medium O
, O
steak O
was O
tough O
, O
lots O
of O
nerves O
, O
steak O
au O
poivre O
sauce O
was O
mediocre O
. O

Super O
friendly O
neighboorhood O
atmosphere B-AS
where O
even O
a O
lady O
can O
go O
alone O
and O
have O
a O
drink B-AS
and O
feel O
comfortable O
. O

The O
last O
time O
I O
went O
to O
the O
restaurant O
, O
the O
waitress B-AS
made O
me O
wait O
to O
take O
my O
order O
, O
then O
left O
me O
without O
anything O
to O
drink O
throughout O
the O
entire O
meal B-AS
. O

delicious O

For O
far O
better O
fish B-AS
at O
the O
same O
price B-AS
( O
but O
less O
interesting O
roll B-AS
combinations O
) O
, O
try O
Yama O
, O
just O
around O
the O
corner O

Steer O
away O
from O
the O
parmesan B-AS
fries I-AS
( O

The O
duck B-AS
burrito I-AS
with I-AS

The O
Scene B-AS
Inconspicuous O
Bottino O
is O
an O
ideal O
stop O
for O
a O
light O
lunch B-AS
or O
full O
dinner B-AS
while O
gallery O
- O
hopping O
through O
Chelsea O
. O

Although O
the O
cheesecake B-AS
didn O
' O
t O
taste O
like O
cheescake O
and O
the O
homefires B-AS
were O
horrible O
, O
overall O
my O
friends O
love O
this O
place O
and O
they O
love O
the O
food B-AS
. O

I O
have O
been O
there O
for O
dinner O
as O
well O
and O
one O
would O
think O
that O
if O
you O
pay O
more O
for O
dinner O
than O
the O
buffet B-AS
you O
would O
get O
better O
quality O
food B-AS
from O
the O
tandoor O
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
disappeared O
after O
dropping O
off O
the O
food B-AS
so O
I O
had O
no O
choice O
but O
to O
eat O
it O
as O
is O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
our O
waiter B-AS
seemed O
to O
have O
short O
- O
term O
memory O
loss O
because O
he O
kept O
forgetting O
to O
bring O
us O
our O
drink B-AS
order O
even O
after O
I O
asked O
him O
on O
three O
separate O
occasions O
. O

If O
you O
' O
re O
a O
meat B-AS
eater O
, O
try O
the O
mixed B-AS
grill I-AS
of O
two O
types O
of O
Chicken O
, O
two O
types O
of O
Lamb O
and O
grilled O
shrimp O
, O
served O
on O
a O
sizzling O
platter B-AS
with I-AS
onions I-AS
and O
peppers O
. O

It O
was O
the O
WORST O
Sangria B-AS
ever O
, O
and O
their O
house O
drink O
has O
just O
a O
shot O
of O
Malibu O
rum O
, O
and O
at O
a O
price B-AS
of O
$ O
9 O
you O
want O
more O
than O
a O
shot O
of O
a O
40 O
% O
alcohol O
. O

servers B-AS
never O
ONCE O
asked O
how O
we O
were O
doing O
- O
they O
brought O
out O
food B-AS
late O
and O
if O
extra O
additions O
were O
requested O
, O
they O
came O
out O
20 O
min O
after O
. O

I O
live O
around O
the O
corner O
and O
I O
miss O
the O
unpretentious O
and O
always O
lovely O
, O
Irving O
on O
Irving O
, O
that O
used O
to O
occupy O
this O
space B-AS
where O
you O
didn O
' O
t O
need O
a O
reservation B-AS
three O
weeks O
in O
advance O
to O
eat O
dinner B-AS
after O
5 O
: O
30 O
and O
before O
11 O
pm O
. O

When O
the O
food B-AS
arrived O
, O
the O
portions B-AS
were O
really O
small O
, O
and O
didn O
' O
t O
really O
reflect O
the O
awesome O
descriptions O
on O
the O
menu O
. O

Then O
the O
manager B-AS
said O
, O
hey O
we O
' O
ll O
give O
you O
shrimp B-AS
instead O
, O
which O
would O
have O
taken O
another O
hour O
. O

Drinks B-AS
are O
a O
bit O
pricey O
( O
$ O
10 O
- O
12 O
) O
but O
delicious O
- O
no O
wine B-AS
is O
less O
than O
$ O
10 O
/ O
glass O
either O
. O

probably O
not O
worth O
the O
wait B-AS
on O
the O
weekend O
when O
pomodoro O
is O
a O
block O
away O
but O
worth O
getting O
for O
delivery B-AS
if O
you O
are O
in O
the O
area O
or O
for O
dinner B-AS
during O
the O
week O
. O

The O
bar B-AS
bites I-AS
weren O
' O
t O
anything O
special O
( O
we O
had O
calamari B-AS
and O
wings O
, O
very O
ordinary O
) O
, O
but O
our O
dinner B-AS
was O
phenomonal O
, O
as O
was O
our O
service O
. O

Come O
hungry O
but O
be O
careful O
not O
to O
order O
too O
large O
an O
appetizer B-AS
because O
it O
would O
be O
a O
shame O
to O
waste O
their O
scallion B-AS
pancakes I-AS
because O
you O
' O
ve O
gotten O
too O
full O
prematurely O
. O

ambience B-AS
and O
decoration B-AS
was O
nice O
but O
for O
a O
check O
of O
$ O
330 O
for O
5 O
for O
brunch B-AS
and O
with O
just O
average O
food B-AS
. O

Here O
' O
s O
how O
it O
works O
: O
you O
walk O
in O
, O
sit O
down O
, O
and O
have O
a O
vegetarian O
thali O
( O
group O
of O
little O
portions B-AS
of O
curries O
) O
that O
invariably O
includes O
lentiles O
, O
a O
small O
salad O
, O
some O
rice O
, O
some O
kind O
of O
samosa O
- O
like O
pastry O
, O
yogurt B-AS
, O
rice O
, O
and O
a O
couple O
of O
sauces B-AS
. O

And O
I O
' O
m O
saying O
that O
dinner B-AS
has O
actually O
taken O
about O
an O
hour O
more O
than O
it O
should O
, O
just O
because O
of O
the O
slow O
service B-AS
. O

We O
actually O
enjoy O
eating O
there O
earlier O
for O
lunch B-AS
definatly O
a O
more O
relaxed O
atmosphere B-AS
. O

If O
you O
like O
a O
cleaner O
( O
more O
generic O
) O
flavor B-AS
then O
other O
places O
may O
provide O
the O
norm B-AS
. O

The O
prices O
were O
moderate O
for O
fine O
dining B-AS
, O
and O
although O
the O
restaurant O
is O
relatively O
small O
, O
it O
was O
easy O
to O
have O
a O
quiet O
conversation O
even O
though O
the O
tables B-AS
are O
fairly O
close O
together O
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
took O
my O
boyfriend O
' O
s O
order O
, O
snatched O
away O
the O
menus B-AS
and O
stormed O
away O
from O
the O
table O
without O
even O
looking O
at O
me O
. O

this O
guy B-AS
should O
work O
in O
a O
dinner B-AS
, O
didn O
' O
t O
even O
know O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
he O
couldn O
' O
t O
explain O
me O
anythings O
, O
a O
real O
nightmare O
. O

The O
place B-AS
is O
plain O
as O
well O
: O
forget O
about O
Nobu O
- O
style O
ambiance O
, O
Bond O
- O
like O
music O
and O
bar B-AS
, O
Next O
door O
Nobu O
good O
- O
looking O
crowds B-AS
etc O
- O
just O
plain O
, O
got O
it O
? O

my O
husband O
has O
certain O
food B-AS
allergies O
, O
and O
they O
were O
100 O
% O
accomodating O
even O
for O
the O
tasting O
menu B-AS
which O
is O
seven O
courses O
for O
$ O
50 O
- O
they O
even O
substituted O
dishes B-AS
for O
ones O
that O
he O
couldn O
' O
t O
have O
. O

The O
menu B-AS
looked O
good O
, O
except O
for O
offering O
the O
Chilean B-AS
Sea I-AS
Bass I-AS
, O
but O
the O
server B-AS
does O
not O
offer O
up O
the O
specials B-AS
that O
were O
written O
on O
the O
board O
outside O
. O

The O
lamb B-AS
was O
wonderful O
, O
although O
I O
could O
do O
without O
all O
the O
beans B-AS
. O

Go O
there O
for O
dinner B-AS
this O
time O
and O
find O
it O
unusually O
bad O
in O
taste O
and O
not O
pleasent O
service B-AS
at O
all O
. O

Good O
Italian O
spot B-AS
, O
but O
should O
raise O
the O
bar B-AS
on O
the O
food B-AS
before O
some O
newcomers O
challenge O
its O
standings O
. O

Basic O
facts O
: O
sub O
- O
par O
limited O
menu O
; O
poorly O
made O
drinks O
; O
random O
crowd O
; O
and O
a O
waitress B-AS
( O
although O
entertaining O
) O
that O
was O
doing O
shots O
behind O
the O
bar B-AS
. O

We O
waited O
15 O
minutes O
for O
a O
menu B-AS
, O
another O
20 O
for O
a O
tea B-AS
, O
another O
15 O
for O
an O
appetizer B-AS
, O
then O
when O
the O
plates B-AS
came O
out O
, O
the O
waitress B-AS
had O
to O
ask O
me O
what O
I O
' O
d O
ordered O
. O

go O
there O
and O
get O
really O
good O
food B-AS
, O
just O
don O
' O
t O
expect O
to O
get O
out O
of O
there O
quickly O
and O
when O
the O
server O
comes O
to O
your O
table B-AS
ask O
for O
everything O
you O
' O
ll O
be O
needing O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
evening O
. O

I O
dined O
in O
the O
Main B-AS
Dining I-AS
Room I-AS
which O
is O
surrounded O
by O
authentic O
Spanish O
decorations B-AS
. O

The O
place O
was O
jumping O
on O
a O
Mon O
nite O
, O
as O
was O
the O
bar B-AS
, O
but O
with O
a O
nice O
mixed B-AS
crowd I-AS
. O

My O
only O
suggestion O
would O
be O
to O
avoid O
long O
waits O
for O
food B-AS
by O
adding O
extra O
servers B-AS
when O
there O
are O
large O
groups O
. O

The O
Scene B-AS
The O
windowed B-AS
bar I-AS
and O
front B-AS
waiting I-AS
area I-AS
seems O
bright O
and O
airy O
compared O
to O
the O
somewhat O
stuffy O
main O
room O
. O

I O
ordered O
the O
Prix B-AS
Fixe I-AS
Pasta I-AS
while O
my O
husband O
and O
children O
ordered O
from O
the O
menu B-AS
- O
we O
were O
all O
happy O
with O
our O
choices O
. O

Beers O
on O
tap B-AS
were O
pretty O
good O
and O
we O
had O
a O
great O
waiter B-AS
but O
the O
food B-AS
left O
much O
to O
be O
desired O
. O

Trendy O
decor O
doesn O
' O
t O
make O
up O
for O
the O
avg B-AS
food I-AS
, O
adequate O
service B-AS
and O
relatively O
high O
prices B-AS
. O

They O
took O
10 O
minutes O
to O
refill O
our O
water O
, O
they O
never O
asked O
if O
we O
would O
like O
another O
drink B-AS
, O
and O
the O
waiter B-AS
was O
nice O
but O
just O
not O
efficient O
. O

I O
had O
the O
lentils O
and O
cous O
cous O
for O
lunch B-AS
the O
next O
day O
because O
my O
friend O
and O
I O
had O
appetizers B-AS
before O
our O
entrees B-AS
- O
- O
portions B-AS
are O
pretty O
decent O
for O
the O
price B-AS
, O
and O
tasty O
to O
boot O
. O

In O
summer O
, O
the O
small O
outdoor B-AS
garden I-AS
is O
an O
ideal O
place O
to O
sip O
coffee B-AS
while O
reading O
under O
a O
canopy O
of O
trees O
and O
sky O
. O

I O
went O
there O
for O
lunch B-AS
with O
my O
mom O
, O
it O
was O
just O
excellent O
, O
the O
sole B-AS
and O
cremed O
spinach B-AS
dish I-AS
I O
had O
was O
divine O
. O

Before O
our O
food B-AS
arrived O
I O
asked O
our O
waitress B-AS
if O
we O
could O
be O
moved O
and O
she O
just O
stared O
blankly O
at O
me O
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
just O
slapped O
my O
food B-AS
down O
and O
then O
never O
returned O
until O
he O
slapped O
my O
check O
down O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
I O
was O
unhappy O
about O
was O
that O
one O
time O
, O
the O
restaurant O
received O
a O
delivery O
of O
supplies O
and O
the O
rolled O
it O
in O
through O
the O
dining B-AS
area I-AS
into O
the O
back B-AS
kitchen I-AS
, O
with O
the O
deliverymen B-AS
shouting O
loud O
things O
to O
each O
other O
in O
chinese O
. O

One O
gentleman B-AS
ignored O
us O
most O
of O
the O
time O
and O
would O
plunk O
the O
coffee B-AS
down O
and O
spill O
it O
on O
the O
table O
without O
saying O
a O
word O
. O

The O
Waterview O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
diners B-AS
I O
' O
ve O
evr O
been O
to O
interms O
of O
the O
quality B-AS
and O
taste O
of O
the O
food B-AS
. O

The O
scene B-AS
is O
reasonably O
cool O
but O
unworth O
more O
than O
a O
drink B-AS
. O

1 O
hour O
for O
water B-AS
, O
1 O
hour O
for O
drinks B-AS
, O
1 O
hour O
for O
food B-AS
, O
as O
you O
can O
see O
we O
were O
there O
for O
almost O
5 O
hours O
before O
our O
bill B-AS
came O
, O
not O
for O
enjoyment O
but O
pure O
frustration O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
was O
really O
nice O
and O
inviting O
but O
our O
waiter B-AS
was O
awful O
! O

As O
soon O
as O
he O
sat O
, O
a O
waiter B-AS
came O
over O
not O
once O
but O
twice O
, O
the O
first O
time O
to O
suggest O
he O
move O
to O
the O
bar B-AS
b I-AS
/ I-AS
c I-AS
our O
large O
booth O
didn O
' O
t O
accomodate O
an O
extra O
person O
, O
the O
second O
time O
to O
insist O
he O
move O
. O

My O
favorites O
are O
the O
chili B-AS
seared I-AS
shrimp I-AS
appetizer I-AS
, O
Macadamia O
chicken O
salad O
, O
yukon O
gold O
potato O
dumplings O
, O
maple B-AS
turkey I-AS
breast I-AS
wrap I-AS
, O
seared O
yellowfin B-AS
tuna I-AS
burger I-AS
and O
for O
dessert B-AS
you O
have O
to O
do O
the O
lemon O
ribbon O
pie O
( O
if O
you O
' O
re O
a O
fan O
of O
ice B-AS
cream I-AS
) O
or O
for O
the O
wintery O
months O
, O
the O
healthy O
pumpkin O
pie O
made O
with O
tofu B-AS
. O

Warning O
, O
you O
are O
supposed O
to O
order O
multiple O
dishes B-AS
, O
so O
if O
you O
order O
just O
an O
entree B-AS
per O
person O
you O
probably O
won O
' O
t O
have O
enough O
. O

I O
have O
seen O
the O
crowd B-AS
go O
from O
ultra O
hip O
to O
BT O
and O
I O
still O
love O
it O
becuause O
of O
the O
food B-AS
. O

Alongside O
the O
USDA B-AS
prime I-AS
dry I-AS
- I-AS
cut I-AS
steaks I-AS
, O
the O
menu B-AS
features O
standard O
steakhouse O
fare O
: O
appetizers O
like O

, O
fresh O
oysters O
and O
clams O
, O
an O
array O
of O

and O
vegetable B-AS
sides I-AS
, O
and O
non O

entrees O
like O
lamb B-AS
, O
veal B-AS
and I-AS
pork I-AS
chops I-AS
, O
lobster B-AS
and O
more O
. O

We O
were O
crammed O
next O
to O
the O
people O
who O
were O
seated O
to O
the O
right O
of O
us O
, O
who O
repeatedly O
took O
phone O
calls O
during O
dinner B-AS
, O
while O
the O
rude O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
did O
nothing O
despite O
the O
warning O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
that O
cell O
phones O
were O
not O
to O
be O
used O
in O
the O

room I-AS
. O

No O
extra O

, O
no O
AC O
, O
no O
ice O
water B-AS
, O
slow O
service B-AS
, O
the O
whole O
thing O
was O
just O
dissapointing O
. O

No O
bread O
basket O
for O
the O
table B-AS
, O
the O
server B-AS
came O
around O
with O
a O
basket O
and O
we O
each O
got O
1 O
piece O
of O
bread O
. O

the O
soups B-AS
were O
superb O
and O
only O
$ O
2 O
a O
bowl B-AS
, O
and O
the O
entire O
dinner B-AS
, O
with O
beers B-AS
, O
cost B-AS
less O
than O
$ O
30 O
for O
two O
people O
. O

However O
the O
manager B-AS
came O
over O
and O
aplogized O
and O
all O
drinks B-AS
were O
on O
him O
. O

The O
service B-AS
always O
ruins O
your O
food B-AS
if O
it O
' O
s O
poor O
. O

We O
had O
: O

The O
Pink O
Pony B-AS
' O
s O
brunch B-AS
is O
among O
the O
very O
best O
in O
the O
city O
! O

The O
bar B-AS
is O
available O
while O
you O
waiting O
for O
the O
table O
, O
the O
DJ B-AS
is O
nice O
. O

Ofcourse O
the O
restaurant O
is O
new O
and O
perhaps O
they O
have O
some O
kinks O
to O
work O
out O
, O
but O
it O
for O
the O
same O
price B-AS
you O
can O
get O
a O
higher O
caliber O
brunch B-AS
at O
Banania O
or O
Cafe O
Luluc O
on O
Smith O
St O
. O

When O
we O
got O
there O
( O
6 O
women O
) O
, O
we O
were O
not O
even O
allowed O
in O
when O
a O
staff B-AS
member I-AS
with O
a O
bad O
attitude O
wearing O
a O
suit O
told O
us O
that O
we O
absolutely O
needed O
a O
reservation B-AS
( O
yes O
, O
we O
' O
ve O
gone O
from O
an O
artsy O
community O
to O
this O
) O
! O

BBQ B-AS
is O
ordinal O
, O
and O
cole B-AS
slaw I-AS
is O
not O
even O
worth O
trying O
. O

It O
' O
s O
cheesy O
, O
great O
herbs B-AS
, O
good O
bread B-AS
and O
large O
slices O
But O
it O
' O
s O
in O
a O
very O
dirty O
area B-AS
, O
good O
for O
take O
out O
and O
bring O
it O
home O
kind O
of O
place O
. O

The O
only O
problem O
my O
party O
found O
was O
that O
when O
people O
asked O
for O
knives O
and O
forks O
( O
there O
were O
only O
chopsticks B-AS
on O
the O
table O
) O
the O
waitress B-AS
laughed O
at O
them O
. O

Waitress B-AS
was O
unenthusiastic O
and O
refilled O
my O
water O
only O
after O
I O
asked O
her O
to O
but O
did O
not O
refill O
my O
date O
' O
s O
empty O
water B-AS
glass I-AS
? O
! O
? O
! O
? O

The O
worst O
occasion O
, O
and O
the O
final B-AS
straw I-AS
for O
me O
was O
when O
myself O
and O
four O
friends O
were O
told O
that O
we O
could O
have O
a O
table O
if O
we O
moved O
away O
from O
our O
stools O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
. O

Staff B-AS
dissappeared O
after O
2PM O
and O
we O
had O
to O
send O
a O
search O
party O
to O
find O
our O
waitress B-AS
who O
was O
parked O
at O
a O
table B-AS
upstairs O
reading O
a O
newspaper O
. O

Warning O
Service B-AS
is O
decent O
, O
but O
it O
takes O
forever O
to O
get O
the O
check B-AS
. O

PS O
: O
to O
the O
waitresses B-AS
and O
waiters B-AS
at O
Shanghai O
Cafe O
( O
new O
name O
of O
Shanghai B-AS
Gourmet I-AS
) O
if O
you O
don O
' O
t O
like O
your O
job O
, O
don O
' O
t O
work O
there O
. O

I O
went O
to O
Joy O
hoping O
to O
find O
some O
great O
Indian B-AS
, O
but O
unfotunately O
found O
curry B-AS
that O
was O
no O
better O
than O
average O
. O

i O
recently O
had O
brunch B-AS
at O
the O
new O
hill O
diner B-AS
let O
me O
tell O
you O
it O
was O
great O
. O

Although O
the O
mediterreanian B-AS
plate I-AS
was O
delicious O
, O
it O
was O
NOT O
what O
I O
' O
d O
expect O
from O
a O
tea B-AS
salon I-AS
. O

My O
wife O
and O
I O
had O
an O
8 O
: O
30 O
reservation B-AS
, O
we O
show O
up O
a O
few O
minutes O
before O
and O
the O
host B-AS
mumbles O
something O
to O
us O
about O
waiting B-AS
at O
the O
bar B-AS
and O
they O
' O
ll O
tell O
us O
when O
the O
table O
is O
ready O

Little O
Italy O
- O
style O
hambone O
performances O
by O
the O
waiters B-AS
( O
actually O
saying O
fugettaboutit O
4 O
times O
during O
specials B-AS
) O
was O
embarassing O
and O
did O
nothing O
to O
hide O
the O
fact O
of O
of O
being O
charged O
for O
4 O
bottles O
of O
wine O
when O
we O
only O
ordered O
3 O
. O

The O
miso B-AS
soup I-AS
lacked O
flavor B-AS
and O
the O
fish B-AS
was O
unfortunately O
not O
as O
well O
prepared O
as O
in O
the O
past O
. O

the O
food B-AS
sucked O
straight O
up O
looks O
like O
a O
nice O
place O
to O
go O
out O
with O
date O
and O
have O
a O
couple O
of O
drinks B-AS
. O

The O
baked B-AS
penne O
came O
out O
in O
a O
small O
bowl O
, O
burnt O
with O
barley O
any O
sauce B-AS
for O
$ O
18 O
. O

it O
did O
fill O
up O
pretty O
quickly O
for O
lunch B-AS
, O
but O
nobody O
seemed O
to O
have O
to O
wait B-AS
too O
long O
, O
and O
i O
' O
m O
guessing O
they O
might O
be O
less O
busy O
for O
dinner B-AS
. O

Helpings B-AS
are O
HUGE O
and O
most O
come O
with O
choice O
of O
rice B-AS
and O
beans B-AS
, O
or O
salad B-AS
and O
plantains B-AS
. O

fresh O
home B-AS
- I-AS
made I-AS

sauce I-AS
with O
chunks B-AS
of I-AS
awesome I-AS
tomatoes I-AS
fire O
it O
all O
up O
in O
a O
brick O
oven O
. O

Main B-AS
dishes I-AS
- O
Vindaloo B-AS
chicken I-AS
OK O
, O
massive O
hunk O
of O
lamb B-AS
decent O
. O

Prices B-AS
are O
not O
cheap O
, O
but O
not O
expensive O
but O
the O
meal B-AS
is O
worth O
every O
penny O
. O

The O
only O
downside O
was O
the O
service B-AS
was O
slow O
and O
our O
waitress B-AS
kept O
forgetting O
to O
bring O
our O
drinks B-AS
. O

They O
have O
samosas O
, O
chicken B-AS
tikka I-AS
masala I-AS
, O
and O
a O
lot O
of O
other O
dishes B-AS
you O
can O
think O
of O
. O

When O
you O
order O
a O
ploughman O
' O
s O
lunch B-AS
you O
don O
' O
t O
even O
get O
bread O
( O
which O
confounded O
me O
) O
and O
the O
mini B-AS
yorkshires I-AS
were O
dry O
as O
a O
bone O
. O

The O
decor B-AS
and O
the O
service O
definitely O
is O
not O
the O
greatest O
, O
but O
I O
can O
overlook O
those O
things O
since O
their O
food B-AS
is O
just O
so O
damn O
good O
. O

The O
best O
thing O
though O
was O
when O
they O
messed O
up O
the O
fish O
order O
they O
not O
only O
gave O
us O
each O
a O
free O
glass B-AS
of I-AS
wine I-AS
, O
but O
they O
took O
that O
fish O
order O
off O
our O
bill B-AS
! O
! O
! O

Although O
Nobu O
requires O
a O
2 O
- O
3 O
month O
advanced O
reservations B-AS
, O
it O
' O
s O
worth O
the O
wait B-AS
! O

The O
menu B-AS
offers O
favorites O
from O
all O
over O
China O
: O
mellow O
Lake O
Tung B-AS
- I-AS
Ting I-AS
shrimp I-AS
from O
Hunan O
; O
peppery O
Sichuan B-AS
tofu I-AS
with I-AS
minced I-AS
pork I-AS
; O
and O
Shanghainese O
soups B-AS
with O
pickled O
mustard O
greens O
. O

Upstairs O
they O
have O
an O
entirely O
separate O
hostess B-AS
, O
as O
if O
it O
was O
a O
different O
restaurant O
all O
together O
, O
where O
after O
being O
asked O
once O
again O
if O
we O
had O
a O
reservation B-AS
we O
were O
seated O
in O
a O
small O
seat O
, O
in O
the O
corner O
, O
of O
a O
practically O
empty O
room O
. O

They O
bought O
the O
same O
surly B-AS
staff I-AS
, O
it O
still O
took O
way O
too O
long O
for O
food O
, O
drink B-AS
, O
ANY O
SERVICE B-AS
and O
the O
food O
is O
still O
$ O
12 O
. O

The O
food O
was O
average O
; O
I O
could O
have O
had O
a O
better O
meal B-AS
at O
the O
local O
pizza B-AS
place I-AS
. O

Once O
the O
manager B-AS
loudly O
referred O
to O
the O
customers O
patiently O
waiting B-AS
at O
the O
all O
- O
you O
- O
can O
- O
eat O
buffet O
line O
as O
' O
hungry O
animals O
attacking O
for O
food B-AS
' O

We O
ordered O
coffee B-AS
, O
and O
then O
he O
ordered O
a O
bacon B-AS
cheeseburger I-AS
( O
for O
$ O
12 O
, O
ridiculous O
even O
for O
New O
York O
) O
The O
waiter B-AS
then O
announced O
he O
was O
going O
to O
charge O
us O
a O
$ O
4 O
sharing O
charge O
. O

Get O
plenty O
on O
food B-AS
for O
the O
price B-AS
. O

Coffee B-AS
, O
treats B-AS
, O
and O
the O
best O
of O
eerything B-AS
. O

And O
that O
is O
a O
shame O
as O
the O
restaurant O
is O
a O
pizzeria O
with O
a O
very O
limited O
menu B-AS
outside O
of O
pizza B-AS
. O

We O
had O
to O
flag O
down O
the O
waiter B-AS
even O
to O
refill O
water B-AS
glasses I-AS
! O

On O
each O
table O
there O
' O
s O
a O
variety B-AS
of I-AS
sauces I-AS
and O
spices B-AS
, O
which O
you O
' O
re O
encouraged O
to O
add O
to O
your O
dish B-AS
; O
by O
the O
end O
of O
the O
meal B-AS
you O
mind O
up O
with O
something O
completely O
different O
in O
your O
bowl B-AS
from O
you O
started O
, O
but O
it O
will O
still O
be O
so O
satisfying O
. O

Cocktails B-AS
were O
ok O
, O
not O
so O
good O
with O
chinese B-AS
food I-AS
so O
hot O
tea O
was O
fine O
for O
us O
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
ignored O
us O
for O
ten O
minutes O
, O
the O
restaurant O
was O
empty O
, O
got O
our O
drink B-AS
orders O
wrong O
, O
got O
one O
main B-AS
dish I-AS
order O
wrong O
and O
the O
disappeared O
for O
another O
ten O
minutes O
before O
we O
could O
get O
the O
check B-AS
. O

Succulent O
, O
buxom O
mussels B-AS
can O
be O
had O
four O
ways O
: O
with O
classical O
white B-AS
wine I-AS
, O
tomatoes B-AS
, O
luxurious O
Pernod B-AS
and O
cream O
, O
or O
chorizo O
and O
white O
beans O
. O

The O
meal O
arrived O
just O
as O
we O
were O
finishing O
the O
appetizers B-AS
, O
each O
good O
portions B-AS
. O

Owner B-AS
Mary O

reel O
rental O
prices B-AS
and O
a O
list O
of O
rules O
on O
the O
backs O
of O
the O
menus B-AS
. O

It O
looks O
like O
a O
small O
pizza B-AS
joint O
, O
and O
it O
is O
, O
but O
the O
food B-AS
and O
service O
are O
out O
of O
this O
world O
. O

I O
sometimes O
long O
for O
their O
chicken B-AS
fried I-AS
steak I-AS
and O
a O
beer B-AS
, O
this O
place O
does O
the O
trick O
every O
time O
. O

We O
went O
on O
a O
Monday O
night O
around O
6 O
: O
30pm O
and O
were O
seated B-AS
right O
away O
in O
the O
backroom O
, O
which O
is O
dimly O
- O
lit O
, O
casual O
, O
cozy O
- O
- O
kind O
of O
felt O
like O
you O
were O
sitting O
in O
a O
spacious O
dining B-AS
galley O
of O
a O
ship O
or O
a O
cabin O
. O

Now O
residing O
in O
Chicago O
, O
the O
only O
quality B-AS
pies I-AS
are O
the O
deep B-AS
dishes I-AS
, O
which O
I O
do O
like O
. O

Their O
menu B-AS
is O
limited O
, O
they O
serve O
miniscule O
omelettes O
that O
may O
be O
suitable O
for O
a O
child O
( O
with O
what O
seems O
like O
a O
teaspoon O
of O
stuffing O
) O
with O
a O
salad O
( O
have O
to O
pay O
even O
more O
for O
fries B-AS
) O
for O
$ O
10 O
- O
which O
was O
poorly O
washed O
and O
there O
were O
bits O
of O
soil O
all O
over O
it O
! O
! O

The O
service B-AS
is O
pleasent O
, O
but O
they O
did O
forget O
to O
bring O
my O
mother O
in O
law O
' O
s O
appetizer B-AS
. O

The O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
pushed O
us O
to O
get O
desserts B-AS
immediately O
after O
we O
finished O
our O
main O
course O
and O
we O
had O
to O
continuously O
tell O
them O
we O
are O
not O
ready O
yet O
. O

HIGHLY O
RECOMMENDED O
, O
MAKE O
RESERVATIONS B-AS
FAR O
IN O
ADVANCE O
TO O
AVOID O
LONG O
WAIT B-AS
TIMES I-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
choices I-AS
were O
a O
bit O
unique O
so O
if O
you O
are O
a O
steak B-AS
and O
potatos O
person O
then O
this O
may O
not O
be O
the O
place O
for O
you O
. O

They O
gave O
us O
desert B-AS
menus I-AS
but O
never O
came O
back O
for O
a O
desert B-AS
order I-AS
, O
instead O
we O
had O
to O
ask O
for O
the O
check B-AS
and O
a O
bus O
boy O
retreived O
it O
for O
us O
. O

Days O
later O
, O
you O
' O
ll O
dream O
about O
luscious O
polenta O
beneath O
braised B-AS

, O
tender O

try O
to O
get O
it O
on O
your O
bread B-AS
without O
getting O
a O
clogged O
artery O
! O
! O
! O

But O
once O
we O
spoke O
up O
( O
and O
they O
figured O
out O
what O
happened O
with O
the O
menus B-AS
) O
they O
re O
- O
did O
the O
dish O
in O
a B-AS
butter I-AS
sage I-AS
sauce I-AS
, O
which O
was O
awesome O
. O

A O
dish B-AS
of O
chewy O
smoked B-AS
seitan I-AS
evokes I-AS
Peking I-AS
duck I-AS
, O
while O
an O
entree B-AS
of O
wide B-AS
green I-AS
- I-AS
tea I-AS
noodles I-AS
is O
served B-AS
in O
a O
tasty O
faux O
Bolognese B-AS
sauce I-AS
. O

However O
service B-AS
was O
quite O
slow O
for O
a O
lunch B-AS
hour O
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
, O
Momir O
, O
was O
on O
top O
of O
everything O
the O
whole O
time O
- O
not O
to O
mention O
entertaining O
us O
by O
constantly O
hitting O
on O
the O
two O
blond O
souther O
girl O
sitting O
at O
the O
table O
next O
to O
us O
- O
- O
and O
the O
free O
wine O
and O
after O
dinner B-AS
espressos O
were O
much O
appreciated O
. O

after O
the O
main O
course O
the O
waitress B-AS
brought O
desert B-AS
menus I-AS
and O
never O
came O
back O
. O

If O
I O
went O
back O
, O
I O
' O
d O
have O
dinner B-AS
in O
the O
bar B-AS
- O
- O
better O
service B-AS
and O
even O
better O
atmosphere O
. O

Though O
weekend O
nights O
and O
Sunday O

draw O
the O
largest O
crowds O
, O
neighborhood O

master O
this O

This O
is O
also O
when O
the O
waiter B-AS
told O
us O
that O
half O
the O
menu B-AS
was O
sold O
out O
. O

I O
like O
the O
smaller O
portion B-AS
size O
for O
dinner B-AS
. O

Our O
server B-AS
never O
bothered O
to O
inquire O
as O
to O
whether O
or O
not O
we O
wanted O
coffee B-AS
. O

considering O
the O
prices B-AS
on O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
i O
' O
d O
rather O
go O
somewhere O
else O
where O
they O
know O
how O
to O
refill O
water B-AS
and O
real O
chairs B-AS
for O
everyone O
, O
something O
you O
can O
even O
get O
at O
mcdonald O
' O

. O

The O
centerpiece O
of O
the O
menu B-AS
is O
a O
range O
of O
sushi B-AS
and O
sashimi B-AS
sets O
: O
standard O
pieces O
and O
rolls B-AS
that O
are O

burger B-AS
and O
great O
big O
fluffy B-AS
fries I-AS
. O

Our O
server O
paid O
little O
attention O
to O
refilling O
our O
drinks B-AS
, O
the O
runners B-AS
brought O
the O
entrees O
out O
less O
than O
1 O
minute O
after O
the O
appetizer B-AS
, O
the O
server O
delivered O
another O
table B-AS
' O
s O
bill B-AS
to O
us O
before O
we O
had O
even O
had O
entrees O
, O
and O
my O
partner O
' O
s O
entree O
has O
a O
very O
noticable O
hair O
on O
his O
plate O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
really O
great O
but O
the O
service B-AS
is O
absolutely O
horrible O
! O

My O
complaint O
was O
the O
service B-AS
was O
not O
that O
good O
but O
the O
food B-AS
made O
up O
for O
it O
. O

The O
restaurant O
has O
a O
Family O
feel O
, O
not O
least O
with O
regard O
to O
the O
portions B-AS
which O
are O
enormous O
; O
the O
veal B-AS
alone O
could O
have O
single O
- O
handedly O
solved O
third O
world O
famine O
. O

The O
line B-AS
moves O
quickly O
, O
perhaps O
because O
there O
are O
no O
alcoholic O
drinks B-AS
, O
which O
cuts O
lingering O
at O
the O
tables O
to O
a O
minimum O
. O

00 O
bottle O
of O
wine O
, O
we O
had O
to O
endure O
the O
waiter O
' O
s O
attitude B-AS
, O
like O
he O
was O
doing O
us O
a O
solid O
, O
if O
you O
' O
re O
into O
huge O
Euro O
crowds B-AS
and O
don O
' O
t O
care O
about O
what O
you O
eat O
and O
how O
it O
is O
served O
to O
you O
, O
Baraonda O
is O
your O
kind O
of O
place O
. O

Waiters B-AS
then O
recite O
an O
impossibly O
long O
list O
of O
specials B-AS
; O
pay O
attention O
or O
you O
' O
ll O
miss O
out O
on O
voluptuous B-AS
porcini I-AS
mushroom I-AS
ravioli I-AS
or O
hefty B-AS
lamb I-AS
chops I-AS
with O
rosemary O
crust O
. O

I O
was O
not O
allowed O
to O
transfer O
my O
credit O
card O
to O
the O
table O
, O
and O
was O
treated O
disgracefully O
while O
the O
hostess B-AS
waited O
for O
the O
bar B-AS
to O
sign O
off O
my O
card O
. O

The O
waitress B-AS
didn O
' O
t O
seem O
to O
know O
anything O
about O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
she O
forgot O
our O
drinks B-AS
, O
took O
away O
our O
wine O
list O
after O
I O
asked O
to O
keep O
it O
, O
and O
then O
said O
, O
I O
' O
m O
sorry O
, O
I O
only O
slept O
3 O
hours O
last O
night O

and O

The O
Food O
It O
' O
s O
billed O
as O
Asian B-AS
street I-AS
food I-AS
, O
but O
since O
the O
menu B-AS
is O
a O
creative O
collaboration O
between O
expert O
chefs O
Vongerichten O
and O
Gray O
Kunz O
, O
dishes O
show O
unmistakable O
finesse O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
good O
except O
the O
waitress B-AS
brought O
over O
the O
check O
before O
I O
asked O
her O
. O

Our O
waitress B-AS
was O
so O
fun O
- O
I O
wanted O
her O
to O
join O
us O
for O
dinner B-AS
. O

Careful O
when O
ordering O
soup B-AS
, O
the O
portion B-AS
is O
huge O
, O
you O
need O
to O
share O
, O
but O
its O
worth O
spending O
the O
extra O
couple O
bucks O
on O
just O
to O
taste O
it O
- O
- O
its O
all O
home O
- O
made O
food B-AS
. O

We O
ate O
brunch B-AS
here O
with O
my O
parents O
on O
a O
Sunday O
afternoon O
- O
- O
delicious O
food B-AS
, O
lovely O
service B-AS
, O
great O
value O
. O

Waiter O
was O
very O
arrogant O
, O
though O
tha O
staff B-AS
was O
attentive O
and O
when O
a O
waiter O
pilled O
a O
glass B-AS
of I-AS
water I-AS
on O
one O
of O
our O
guests O
, O
the O
hostess B-AS
ran O
with O
a O
dry O
cleaning O
voucher O
even O
though O
we O
did O
not O
make O
a O
big O
deak O
of O
it O
- O
just O
an O
accident O
and O
only O
water O
. O

Upon O
calling O
to O
reserve O
a O
table O
outside O
for O
Brunch B-AS
, O
the O
manager B-AS
requested O
a O
cc O
nbr O
to O
secure O
the O
table O
for O
6 O
( O
I O
was O
8 O
months O
pregnant O
and O
there O
was O
a O
little O
baby O
) O
. O

The O
Chinese B-AS
menu I-AS
is O
gone O
, O
along O
with O
most O
of O
the O
good O
dishes B-AS
. O

However O
, O
the O
restaurant O
is O
nothing O
special O
and O
and O
the O
food B-AS
is O
hit O
or O
miss O
- O
perhaps O
the O
chef B-AS
should O
tend O
more O
to O
his O
main B-AS
dishes I-AS
rather O
than O
mingling O
with O
the O
customers O
. O

The O
ribs B-AS
superb O
, O
the O
steak B-AS
, O
the O
chicken B-AS
wings I-AS
, O
the O
french B-AS
fries I-AS
, O
the O
hamburger B-AS
. O

We O
started O
ordering O
wine B-AS
and O
, O
since O
we O
don O
' O
t O
know O
much O
about O
it O
, O
we O
decided O
to O
let O
the O
waiter B-AS
choose O
for O
us O
; O
we O
were O
pleased O
with O
his O
recommendation O
. O

Don O
' O
t O
ever O
bother O
- O
the O
drinks B-AS
were O
awful O
, O
but O
it O
was O
the O
people B-AS
who O
work O
there O
that O
really O
made O
this O
the O
worst O
experience O
at O
dining B-AS
. O

The O
food O
is O
first O
- O
rate O
awful O
- O
they O
managed O
to O
offend O
two O
countries O
in O
one O
meal O
- O
my O
husband O
' O
s O
middle O
eastern O
platter O
( O
hummous B-AS
, O
falafel B-AS
, O
stale O
chips O
) O
was O
lo O
ta O
' O
im O
( O
not O
tasty O
) O
- O
and O
my O
mexican O
salad O
( O
bean O
, O
avocado O
, O
lettuce B-AS
, O
stale O
chips O
) O
was O
muy O
repugnato O
. O

Generous O
portions B-AS
on O
the O
entrees B-AS
. O

Oh O
, O
and O
kudos O
to O
the O
hostess B-AS
who O
appeared O
out O
of O
thin O
air B-AS
with O
extra O
napkins O
just O
moments O
after O
a O
glass B-AS
of I-AS
water I-AS
was O
knocked O
over O
- O
she O
' O
s O
upping O
the O
bar B-AS
on O
service B-AS
here O
. O

Pork B-AS
chops I-AS
is O
probably O
the O
best O
choice O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
. O

Binegar O
, O
soy B-AS
sauce I-AS
, O
pish B-AS
sauce I-AS
, O
garLIC B-AS
, I-AS
ginger I-AS
, I-AS
chicken I-AS
, O
lechon O
, O
oh O
man O
, O
it O
was O
sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo O
good O
. O

However O
, O
it O
was O
a O
very O
long O
wait B-AS
( O
over O
45 O
min O
) O
and O
I O
confronted O
the O
hostess B-AS
who O
stated O
that O
she O
could O
not O
find O
me O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
and O
she O
had O
seated O
6 O
other O
parties O
before O
me O
. O

the O
dishes B-AS
are O
a O
little O
too O
recherche O
and O
too O
trendy O
for O
their O
own O
good O
and O
there O
is O
not O
enough O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
for O
vegetarians O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
spectacular O
, O
from O
the O
appitizers B-AS
to O
the O
main B-AS
course I-AS
, O
and O
then O
of O
course O
the O
desserts B-AS
, O
( O
WOW O
) O
you O
' O
ll O
need O
no O
more O
. O

Our O
waiter B-AS
had O
started O
to O
circle O
around O
our O
table B-AS
like O
a O
shark O
after O
our O
2nd O
dish O
, O
taking O
out O
plates B-AS
when O
we O
were O
not O
even O
done O
. O

From O
a O
solid O
homey O
, O
affordable O
Italian O
menu B-AS
in O
a O
warm O
, O
exhileratingly O
crowded O
location O
they O
' O
ve O
gone O
to O
a O
30 O
$ O
minimum O
per O
person O
on O
opera O
nights O
with O
a O
quality B-AS
of I-AS
food I-AS
and O
drink B-AS
that O
just O
does O
not O
warrant O
the O
prices O
. O

Even O
without O
this O
hiccup O
, O
the O
service B-AS
seemed O
very O
amateur O
- O
- O
not O
snooty O
, O
as O
I O
' O
ve O
read O
in O
other O
reviews O
- O
- O
just O
nowhere O
near O
as O
good O
as O
it O
should O
be O
given O
the O
price B-AS
of O
the O
meal B-AS
. O

Upon O
arrival O
I O
attempted O
to O
give O
a O
waiter B-AS
my O
name O
( O
there O
doesn O
' O
t O
seem O
to O
be O
a O
hostess B-AS
) O
and O
tell O
him O
I O
had O
a O
9pm O
reservation B-AS
, O
but O
was O
told O
to O
just O
go O
get O
in O
line O
and O
wait O
for O
a O
table B-AS
. O

Main O
courses O
include O
char O
- O
grilled O
whole O
brook O
trout O
, O
baby B-AS
lamb I-AS
sotee I-AS
, O
and O
( O
of O
course O
) O
kebabs B-AS
of I-AS

and O
chicken B-AS
; O
Try O
the O
thick O
Turkish B-AS
coffee I-AS
with O
a O
dessert O
of O
Kunefe B-AS
with O
cheese B-AS
! O

food O
is O
heaven O
we O
were O
greeted O
by O
the O
hostess B-AS
and O
sat O
down O
immediatly O
the O
space O
was O
very O
crowded O
and O
and O
we O
decided O
to O
order O
drinks B-AS
promptly O
food O
can O
wait O
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
, O
and O
someone O
at O
the O
next O
table O
, O
were O
both O
correct O
when O
they O
said O
that O
the O
lobster B-AS
was O
delicious O
, O
but O
I O
though O
the O
price B-AS
was O
a O
little O
steep O
. O

Tony O
' O
s O
gone O
, O
sadly O
Ernie O
' O
s O
passed O
on O
and O
now O
the O
waiters B-AS
have O
corn B-AS
rows I-AS
and O
less O
finish O
to O
their O
chosen O
profession O
but O
it O
still O
maintains O
it O
' O
s O
class O
and O
place O
as O
a O
brooklyn O
landmark O
. O

The O
line O
gets O
a O
bit O
claustrophobic O
, O
since O
you O
' O
re O
jammed O
against O
the O
counter O
, O
but O
the O
enormous O
Greek B-AS
salad I-AS
( O
replete O
with O
herbed O
feta O
, O
slightly O
sweet O
dolmades O
and O
a O
plethora B-AS
of I-AS
olives I-AS
) O
, O
the O
baba O
ghanouj O
and O
the O
eponymous B-AS
falafel I-AS
are O
great O
, O
as O
are O
the O
spanokopita O
and O
other O
spur O
- O
of O
- O
the O
- O
moment O
pastries B-AS
they O
always O
seem O
to O
be O
featuring O
. O

The O
wait B-AS
can O
be O
long O
especially O
during O
brunch B-AS
time O
but O
worth O
it O
. O

The O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
had O
good O
recommendations O
and O
when O
i O
broke O
a O
wine O
glass O
, O
they O
reacted O
in O
a O
way O
to O
put O
me O
out O
of O
my O
embarrassment O
quickly O
and O
even O
filled O
me O
a O
new O
glass B-AS
of I-AS
wine I-AS
. O

When O
you O
' O
re O
sitting O
in O
their O
main B-AS
dining I-AS
room I-AS
( O
which O
has O
a O
spectacular O
, O
hand O
- O
painted O
high O
ceiling B-AS
) O
you O
' O
d O
never O
know O
there O
was O
a O
world O
outside O
. O

I O
went O
for O
dinner B-AS
at O
Lucy O
the O
other O
night O
with O
five O
friends O
and O
it O
was O
the O
best O
experience O
I O
' O
ve O
had O
in O
a O
long O
time B-AS
. O

Our O
waiter B-AS
snubbed O
us O
when O
we O
asked O
if O
there O
was O
dessert B-AS
( O
there O
wasn O
' O
t O
) O
, O
and O
my O
meal B-AS
would O
have O
been O
the O
same O
price B-AS
had O
it O
not O
been O
restaurant O
week O
. O

The O
first O
time O
my O
husband O
and O
I O
went O
there O
, O
both O
the O
appetizer B-AS
and O
entreee O
I O
ordered O
were O
not O
available O
, O
but O
we O
had O
a O
waitress B-AS
who O
was O
really O
on O
top O
of O
things O
. O

Half O
an O
hour O
after O
our O
appetizer B-AS
was O
cleared O
, O
the O
waiter B-AS
told O
us O
it O
would O
take O
more O
time O
to O
get O
our O
main O
courses B-AS
. O

Plenty O
of O
tables B-AS
to O
allow O
for O
some O
alone O
time O
with O
a O
friend O
in O
an O
otherwise O
sometimes O
crowded O
bar B-AS
area I-AS
. O

The O
service B-AS
is O
friendly O
, O
if O
not O
the O
most O
prompt O
in O
the O
world O
, O
the O
food B-AS
is O
great O
, O
and O
the O
prices B-AS
, O
while O
not O
cheap O
, O
won O
' O
t O
put O
your O
wallet O
out O
of O
commission O
. O

The O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
is O
very O
attentive O
; O
though O
if O
the O
place B-AS
is O
really O
packed O
, O
then O
you O
may O
have O
to O
flag O
someone O
. O

The O
waitstaff B-AS
is O
helpful O
and O
they O
' O
ll O
get O
your O
favorite O
meats B-AS
to O
circle O
your O
table B-AS
more O
often O
if O
you O
just O
ask O
. O

Part O
of O
the O
charm O
is O
in O
the O
earnest O
service B-AS
; O
part O
of O
it O
is O
the O
colorful O
clientele B-AS
; O
but O
the O
real O
charm O
comes O
from O
what O
emerges O
from O
the O
kitchen B-AS
. O

Our O
waiter B-AS
must O
have O
been O
a O
' O
stand O
- O
in O
' O
because O
he O
did O
not O
know O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
choices O
or O
basic O
service B-AS
protocol O
( O
bread O
plate O
on O
the O
left O
) O
. O

Our O
server B-AS
seemed O
out O
of O
it O
, O
and O
drinks B-AS
took O
15 O
minutes O
to O
arrive O
. O

for O
instance O
, O
i O
sat O
next O
to O
this O
couple O
who O
experienced O
problems O
with O
their O
food B-AS
and O
the O
asked O
to O
speak O
to O
a O
manager B-AS
. O

Whatever O
happen O
to O
FAMILY O
STYLE B-AS
Thai I-AS
cooking I-AS
, O
the O
portion B-AS
are O
too O
small O
and O
tradtional O
thai O
cooking O
uses O
MSG O
which O
I O
prefer O
not O
to O
have O
in O
my O
body O
. O

We O
asked O
for O
our O
check O
( O
to O
pay O
for O
our O
drinks B-AS
and O
leave O
) O
, O
and O
received O
the O
quickest O
service B-AS
all O
evening O
. O

After O
spending O
about O
2 O
hours O
in O
the O
restaurant O
our O
waiter B-AS
decided O
to O
call O
it O
a O
night O
without O
even O
asking O
if O
we O
wanted O
dessert B-AS
. O

The O
food O
was O
cold O
and O
did O
not O
match O
the O
description B-AS
on O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
the O
waiter B-AS
could O
not O
be O
bothered O
with O
me O
( O
and O
I O
am O
nice O
to O
deal O
with O
since O
I O
work O
in O
the O
industry O
) O
, O
and O
it O
was O
way O
over O
priced O
. O

I O
went O
to O
the O
tasting O
before O
Nobu O
opened O
and O
the O
menu B-AS
and O
service B-AS
has O
greatly O
improved O
since O
then O
. O

At O
almost O
$ O
70 O
/ O
person O
with O
a O
glass B-AS
of I-AS
wine I-AS
, O
the O
food B-AS
is O
overrated O

Besides O
the O

, O
the O

reminds O
one O
of O

in O
your O

My O

Diner O

is O

by O

We O
did O
complain O
to O
the O
manager B-AS
, O
but O
she O
just O
said O
there O
are O
problems O
in O
the O

took O
the O
drinks B-AS
off O
bill O

This O
closet O
- O
sized O
little O
eatery O
has O
a O
great O
collection B-AS
of O
wine B-AS
, O
by O
the O

carafe O

Their O
relatively O
recent O
introduction O
of O
a O
version O
of O
the O
Sicilian B-AS
pie I-AS
is O
called O
the O
Grandma O
pie O
featuring O
a O
thin O
crust O
, O
much O
sauce B-AS
, O
with O
less O
cheese O
, O
and O
chopped B-AS
Basil I-AS
. O

The O
brunch B-AS
entrees I-AS
were O
shockingly O
overpriced O
, O
even O
for O
the O
area B-AS
, O
and O
especially O
given O
the O
food B-AS
quality I-AS
. O

After O
being O
seated B-AS
at O
an O
outdoor B-AS
table I-AS
on O
a O
45 O
degree O
tilt O
, O
the O
surly O
waitress B-AS
gave O
us O
menus O
. O

You O
should O
not O
go O
to O
a O
Brazilian B-AS
BBQ I-AS
place O
and O
have O
to O
chase O
the O
waiters B-AS
and O
go O
to O
the O
hostess B-AS
ASKING O
FOR O
MEAT B-AS
. O

I O
looked O
for O
months O
for O
a O
reasonably O
priced B-AS
place I-AS
that O
could O
accommodate O
about O
40 O
people O
for O
a O
wedding O
rehearsal O
dinner B-AS
on O
a O
Friday O
night O
. O

The O
place B-AS
is O
very O
loud O
, O
good O
for O
drinks B-AS
by O
the O
bar B-AS
not O
to O
eat O
and O
yell O
. O

The O
waitor O
never O
gave O
us O
the O
specials O
menu O
( O
which O
they O
gave O
to O
a O
another O
couple O
who O
sat O
next O
to O
us O
20 O
minutes O
later O
) O
and O
the O
service B-AS
was O
very O
slow O
even O
for O
the O
basics O
( O
bread O
and O
water B-AS
, O
for O
which O
we O
had O
to O
ask O
a O
couple O
of O
times O
) O
. O

When O
we O
finally O
got O
our O
waiters B-AS
attention O
- O
and O
explained O
to O
him O
we O
were O
unhappy O
with O
our O
entrees B-AS
, O
his O
demeanor O
changed O
completely O
, O
he O
took O
our O
dishes O
and O
walked O
away O
without O
taking O
another O
order O
for O
us O
or O
asking O
if O
he O
could O
get O
us O
anything O
else O
. O

After O
we O
sat O
down O
and O
started O
ordering O
, O
the O
waiter B-AS
informed O
us O
that O
they O
were O
really O
only O
into O
serving B-AS
dinners I-AS
. O

First O
of O
all O
we O
ordered O
a O
wine B-AS
from O
the O
menu B-AS
listed O
as O
2000 O
but O
the O
waiter B-AS
brought O
the O
2001 O
vintage O
and O
tried O
to O
pass O
it O
off O
as O
the O
2000 O
. O

The O
Scene B-AS
The O

looks O
like O
it O

We O
arrived O
about O
15 O
minutes O
late O
for O
a O
Friday O
12 O
: O
30 O
reservation B-AS
, O
but O
the O
staff B-AS
couldn O
' O
t O
have O
been O
nicer O
. O

I O
would O
not O
return O
for O
a O
$ O
30 O
entree B-AS
of O
inadequate O
portions B-AS
. O

The O
place B-AS
was O
empty O
except O
for O
one O
table B-AS
, O
but O
they O
were O
just O
having O
drinks B-AS
( O
red O

. O

The O
service O
and O
atmosphere B-AS
may O
not O
set O
your O
mood O
but O
when O
you O
' O
re O
done O
you O
will O
realize O
that O
it O
' O
s O
only O
the O
food B-AS
that O
counts O

Scene B-AS
Quartino O

wrapped O
in O
high O
windows O

out O

while O
swapping O

A O
friend O
and O
I O
had O
a O
lovely O
bottle B-AS
of I-AS
wine I-AS
, O
two O
appetizers B-AS
, O
two O
main B-AS
courses I-AS
and O
two O
coffees O
and O
we O
had O
change O
from O
$ O

. O

As O
we O
were O
finishing O
our O
dessert B-AS
, O
a O
nearby O
waitress B-AS
dropped O
a O
tray O
and O
HOT B-AS
CHOCOLATE I-AS

splattered O
all O
over O
my O
neck O
, O
hair O
and O

and O

We O
sat O
, O
missing O
a O

setting B-AS
for O
a O
while O
before O
the O
waitress B-AS
came O
to O
ask O
if O
we O
wanted O

then O
ran O
away O

We O
recently O
visited O
Madiba O
for O
lunch B-AS
, O
and O
our O
waitress B-AS
was O
sweet O
but O
ineffective O
. O

The O
ingredients B-AS
used O
are O
of O
a O
good O
quality B-AS
and O
the O
taste B-AS
is O
superb O
. O

Space B-AS
aside O
, O
service O
is O
ok O
but O
the O
food B-AS
is O
really O
well O
done O
. O

After O
two O
terrific O
meals B-AS
in O
the O
dining B-AS
room I-AS
, O
we O
opted O
to O
sit O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
on O
our O
third O
visit O
. O

not O
to O
mention O
that O
the O
waiter B-AS
offered O
putting O
a O
scoop O
of O
ice O
cream O
on O
my O
dessert B-AS
. O

The O
place B-AS
was O
not O
crowded O
for O
dinner B-AS
on O
a O
Sunday O
night O
at O
8 O
: O
30pm O
. O

Waiter B-AS
suggests O
a O
beer O
, O
and O
offers O
to O
bring O
a O
small O
glass B-AS
, O
to O
taste O
it O
and O
see O
if O
I O
like O
it O
, O
before O
I O
even O
order O
the O
beer O
! O

And O
then O
he O
' O
ll O
forget O
to O
bring O
your O
drink B-AS
every O
time O
you O
order O
one O
, O
won O
' O
t O
pay O
attention O
to O
your O
table O
of O
8 O
, O
will O
give O
you O
unwarranted O
attitude B-AS
, O
and O
never O
be O
friendly O
or O
smile O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
good O
whether O
you O
are O
going O
for O
dinner B-AS
or O
just O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
drinks B-AS
and O
a O
small O
appetizer O
. O

I O
can O
honestly O
say O
that O
while O
some O
of O
the O
dishes B-AS
I O
have O
had O
at O
other O
places O
I O
might O
have O
rated O
on O
an O
individual O
basis O
higher O
I O
have O
not O
enjoyed O
a O
total O
dining B-AS
experience O
more O
. O

The O
kitchen B-AS
staff I-AS
either O
cannot O
or O
will O
not O
accomodate O
special O
diets O
which O
is O
surprising O
given O
that O
there O
are O
so O
many O
fine O
dining O
establishments O
that O
do O
have O
special O
menus B-AS
to O
cater O
to O
vegetarians O
. O

It O
is O
nearly O
impossible O
to O
get O
a O
table B-AS
, O
so O
if O
you O
ever O
have O
the O
chance O
to O
go O
here O
for O
dinner B-AS
, O
DO O
NOT O
pass O
it O
up O
. O

Our O
margaritas B-AS
came O
after O
1 O
/ O
2 O
an O
hour O
- O
and O
they O
didn O
' O
t O
ever O
ask O
if O
we O
wanted O
more O
- O
the O
server O
brought O
all O
our O
food O
to O
the O
wrong O
table O
- O
my O
dinner B-AS
came O
after O
my O
boyfriend O
had O
finished O
his O
plate O
and O
they O
ran O
out O
of O
a O
certain O
dish B-AS
at O
9PM O
on O
a O
Friday O
! O
! O

The O
food B-AS
was O
good O
but O
not O
worth O
the O
price B-AS
. O

Village B-AS
salad I-AS
had O
a O
lot O
more O
cucumbers O
than O
tomatoes O
most O
likely O
because O
tomatoes O
are O
expensive O
in O
US O
and O
they O
want O
to O
earn O
more O
taking O
advantage O
of O
people O
who O
don O
' O
t O
know O
about O
Greek B-AS
food I-AS
. O

I O
can O
' O
t O
speak O
on O
the O
food B-AS
, O
but O
I O
went O
there O
for O
a O
show O
the O
other O
week O
and O
here O
is O
my O
experience O
: O
one O
of O
the O
friendliest O
servers B-AS
ever O
( O
no O
attitude O
) O
; O
the O
drinks B-AS
were O
avg O
. O

Wait B-AS
staff I-AS
is O
seemingly O
non O
- O
existant O
, O
and O
food B-AS
servers I-AS
are O
way O
too O
agressive O
- O
our O
food O
was O
thrown O
on O
the O
table B-AS
, O
and O
even O
knocked O
a O
member O
of O
my O
party O
in O
the O
head O
with O
a O
plate O
with O
little O
acknowledgement O
. O

Actually O
she O
want O
to O
eat O
sushi B-AS
, O
but O
their O
staff B-AS
reject O
to O
serve O
it O
. O

The O
irony O
of O
it O
all O
is O
that O
I O
tried O
the O
fish O
and O
chips B-AS
at O
a O
sports O
bar B-AS
across O
the O
street O
the O
following O
week O
, O
1 O
/ O
2 O
the O
price B-AS
( O
w B-AS
/ I-AS
fries I-AS
included O
) O
, O
and O
the O
portion B-AS
was O
bigger O
and O
much O
tastier O
. O

The O
Scene B-AS
This O
tiny O
jewel O
of O
a O
spot B-AS
is O
simply O
decorated O
with O
white O
walls O
and O
plate O
glass B-AS
. O

Amazing O
views B-AS
of O
NYC O
regaled O
us O
at O
lunch O
earlier O
in O
the O
week O
and O
then O
at O
dinner B-AS
this O
evening O
. O

Bartender B-AS
seemed O
cool O
, O
so O
maybe O
I O
' O
d O
go O
back O
for O
a O
drink B-AS
. O

Then O
another O
pleasant O
surprise B-AS
- O
the O
menu B-AS
said O
we O
had O
to O
share O
the O
entree B-AS
for O
each O
couple O
. O

the O
rest O
of O
my O
table O
disliked O
their O
food B-AS
, O
and O
also O
had O
to O
send O
drinks B-AS
back O
because O
it O
was O
not O
what O
they O
ordered O
. O

It O
took O
an O
hour O
for O
us O
to O
order O
, O
another O
hour O
and O
15 O
min O
to O
get O
our O
entree B-AS
' I-AS
s I-AS
I O
had O
to O
go O
to O
the O
bar B-AS
to O
order O
my O
champange O
, O
and O
carry O
it O
back O
myself O
, O
the O
waiter B-AS
got O
our O
entrees O
mixed O
up O
and O
placed O
them O
in O
the O
wrong O
place O
and O
sat O
there O
and O
watched O
me O
switch O
them O
around O
. O

I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
I O
' O
ve O
been O
there O
only O
during O
brunch B-AS
time O
but O
the O
service B-AS
even O
though O
slow O
, O
it O
was O
good O
. O

throughout O
the O
whole O
meal B-AS
, O
all O
I O
kept O
thinking O
was O
AVERAGE O
, O
AVERAGE O
, O
AVERAGE O
until O
the O
bill B-AS
came O
, O
which O
was O
a O
little O
more O
than O
average O
, O
to O
say O
the O
least O
. O

although O
the O
food B-AS
was O
well O
- O
prepared O
, O
it O
was O
not O
worth O
the O
price B-AS
, O
especially O
when O
it O
does O
not O
include O
dessert B-AS
! O

We O
decided O
to O
order O
soup O
( O
over O
$ O
6 O
a O
bowl B-AS
) O
, O
thinking O
that O
would O
be O
quick O
, O
however O
our O
waitress B-AS
then O
said O
the O
soup O
is O
OUT O
OF O
A O
CAN O
and O
still O
would O
be O
a O
20 O
minute O
wait O
since O
the O
tickets O
are O
processed O
in O
order O
. O

When O
we O
first O
walked O
in O
, O
we O
saw O
other O
diners O
wiping O
their O
plates O
with O
bread O
- O
so O
we O
though O
that O
the O
food B-AS
was O
good O
- O
but O
we O
very O
soon O
realized O
that O
the O
portions B-AS
really O
were O
so O
small O
that O
you O
really O
have O
to O
lick O
your O
plate O
clean O
- O
afterall O
, O
their O
dinners O
costs O
a O
fortune O
. O

Were O
told O
we O
could O
not O
share O
one O
menu B-AS
and O
called O
over O
the O
horrible O
manager B-AS
. O

We O
were O
even O
able O
to O
call O
in O
advance O
to O
make O
sure O
there O
was O
space O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
because O
I O
was O
on O
crutches O
and O
the O
owner B-AS
reserved O
the O
seats B-AS
til O
we O
got O
there O
. O

From O
the O
bottomless O
cup B-AS
of I-AS
coffee I-AS
to O
the O
basket B-AS
o O
' O
scones O
mini O
- O
muffins O
to O
the O
delicious O
entrees B-AS
, O
Dizzy O
' O
s O
is O
the O
place O
to O
be O
. O

It O
' O
s O
the O
New O
York O
you O
thought O
was O
long O
gone O
; O
orders O
are O
spoken O
, O
not O
yelled O
, O
and O
the O
staff B-AS
knows O
the O
names O
of O
patrons B-AS
' O
dogs O
. O

We O
ordered O
off O
the O
restaurant O
week O
menu B-AS
, O
which O
at O
other O
establishments O
means O
automatic O
second O
- O
rate O
service B-AS
, O
but O
not O
here O
. O

For O
desert B-AS
take O
the O
tiramisu B-AS
, O
it O
is O
by O
far O
the O
best O
there O
. O

After O
being O
seated B-AS
by O
a O
very O
kind O
, O
but O
quite O
stressed O
, O
young O
lady B-AS
, O
we O
took O
in O
the O
room O
and O
menu B-AS
. O

I O
don O
' O
t O
like O
places O
that O
sacrifice O
quality B-AS
for O
money O
or O
play O
tricks O
on O
you O
by O
hiding O
drink B-AS
prices I-AS
till O
check O
time O
( O
everyone O
at O
the O
place O
was O
drinking O
Sangria B-AS
, O
so O
that O
, O
it O
seems O
, O
must O
be O
the O
money O
- O
maker O
) O
. O

Somewhat O
agree O
with O
the O
previous O
reviews O
about O
service B-AS
and O
the O
long B-AS
wait I-AS
but O
once O
seated O
, O
the O
food B-AS
is O
well O
worth O
it O
. O

The O

of O
the O
legendary O
Harry O
' O
s O
Bar B-AS
in O
Venice O
is O
frequented O
by O
a O

the O
types O
who O
don O
' O
t O
bother O
looking O
at O
menu B-AS
prices I-AS
when O
they O
order O
. O

I O
also O
asked O
for O
a O
chef O
( O
thought O
that O
may O
be O
able O
to O
talk O
about O
the O
food B-AS
for O
the O
party O
) O
, O
but O
the O
waitress B-AS
said O
that O
there O
was O
no O
chef O
at O
the O
restaurant O
. O

MY O
FATHER O
ASKED O
FOR O
A O
MARTINI B-AS
MADE O
A O
CERTAIN O
WAY O
THE O
WAITER B-AS
HAD O
NO O
CLUE O
WHAT O
HE O
WAS O
TALKING O
ABOUT O
. O

It O
is O
never O
a O
ridiculous O
wait B-AS
no O
more O
than O
30 O
minutes O
, O
in O
the O
meantime O
you O
can O
chat O
with O
your O
friends O
and O
start O
the O
week O
- O
end O
off O
right O
with O
a O
signature O
drink B-AS
from O
the O
bar B-AS
! O

As O
we O
sat O
waiting B-AS
for O
our O
menus B-AS
, O
we O
started O
noticing O
the O
frowns O
on O
the O
faces O
of O
the O
people O
around O
us O
, O
watching O
as O
patrons O
tried O
to O
flag O
down O
waiters B-AS
without O
luck O
, O
asking O
for O
things O
like O
water B-AS
. O

I O
was O
tempted O
to O
try O
the O
dessert B-AS
because O
I O
' O
ve O
heard O
rave O
reviews O
about O
it O
, O
but O
we O
were O
stuffed O
, O
as O
the O
portions B-AS
are O
fairly O
large O
. O

The O
service O
is O
almost O
stifling O
polite O
( O
they O
pushed O
in O
my O
chair B-AS
behind O
me O
every O
time O
I O
returned O
from O
the O
bathroom O
) O
, O
though O
the O
sushi O
chef O
preparing O
my O
food B-AS
was O
casual O
and O
chatty O
. O

The O
choices B-AS
on O
the O
menu B-AS
were O
very O
limited O
- O
discounting O
raw O
items O
, O
there O
were O
practically O
no O
appetizers B-AS
The O
foie O
gras O
de O
canard O
was O
mediocre O
with O
a O
syrupy O
sauce O
. O

And O
I O
agree O
with O
a O
couple O
of O
reviews O
down O
that O
the O
asparagus B-AS
and I-AS
egg I-AS
app I-AS
is O
very O
very O
good O
, O
but O
not O
light O
on O
calories O
- O
- O
also O
huge O
and O
low O
- O
ish O
on O
carbs O
, O
so O
you O
Atkiners O
could O
eat O
that O
for O
an O
entree B-AS
. O

We O
probably O
would O
have O
stuck O
out O
the O
wait B-AS
if O
we O
could O
have O
gotten O
a O
drink B-AS
at O
the O
bar B-AS
but O
apparently O
it O
was O
closed O
or O
only O
for O
show O
. O

Not O
only O
did O
they O
refuse O
to O
give O
me O
any O
milk O
but O
they O
charged O
me O
full O
price B-AS
( O
$ O
9 O
) O
for O
plain O
udon O
noodles O
- O
no O
broth O
, O
veggies O
, O
or O
meat O
just O
wet O
noodles O
in O
a O
bowl B-AS
. O

Service B-AS
was O
good O
throughout O
the O
dinner B-AS
but O
when O
it O
came O
time O
to O
get O
the O
check O
, O
we O
waited O
over O
20 O
min O
. O

I O
haven O
' O
t O
tried O
their O
brunch B-AS
, O
partly O
because O
their O
coffee B-AS
is O
a O
bit O
weak O
to O
me O
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
asked O
us O
several O
times O
after O
dinner B-AS
whether O
we O
had O
paid O
our O
bill B-AS
yet O
, O
and O
after O
we O
had O
, O
he O
came O
over O
to O
make O
sure O
that O
we O
hadn O
' O
t O
just O
hidden O
it O
from O
him O
or O
something O
. O

Aged O
beef B-AS
charred O
on O
the O
outside B-AS
, O
red O
on O
the O
inside O
. O

Great O
from O
appetizer B-AS
to O
dessert B-AS
including O
a O
wonderfully O
created O
vegetarian O
plate O
that O
is O
not O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
. O

We O
took O
seats O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
with O
2 O
amazing O
bottles B-AS
of I-AS
wine I-AS
( O
one O
for O
the O
appetizers B-AS
and O
one O
to O
match O
the O
entrees O
) O
Monsieur O
Zucco O
was O
very O
accomodating O
and O
kept O
a O
sharp O
eye O
at O
filling O
our O
glasses O
at O
the O
right O
time O
at O
the O
right O
level O
. O

, O
good O
coffee B-AS
, O
a O

we O
saw O
another O
waitress B-AS
spill O
hot B-AS
coffee I-AS
on O
another O
diner O

foot O
. O

The O
steak B-AS
and O
sides B-AS
at O
Luger O
' O
s O
are O
definitely O
tasty O
, O
but O
the O
legendary O
status O
it O
seems O
to O
hold O
lead O
me O
to O
be O
disappointed O
after O
the O
actual O
meal B-AS
. O

The O
spring B-AS
rolls I-AS
are O
great O
, O
tastes O
like O
any O
other O
rolls O
with O
meat B-AS
filling O
and O
I O
had O
the O
soy B-AS
protein I-AS
ham I-AS
dish I-AS
( O
bad O
idea O
) O
. O

My O
girlfriend O
had O
a O
margarita B-AS
she O
said O
was O
ok O
, O
and O
I O
had O
a O
soda B-AS
that O
somehow O
tasted O
terrible O
, O
like O
the O
line O
was O
dirty O
. O

Only O
quibbles O
are O
so O
- O
so O
wine B-AS

and O
while O
Prix B-AS

reasonable O
at O

The O
waitress B-AS
, O
host B-AS
, O
and O
bus O
staff B-AS
were O
sitting O
around O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
while O
the O
patrons B-AS
were O
all O
complaining O
about O
the O
service B-AS
. O

The O
place B-AS
was O
empty O
with O
three O
waiters B-AS
working O
and O
it O
still O
took O
15 O
minutes O
to O
bring O
us O
menus B-AS
. O

It O
took O
us O
about O
30 O
minutes O
to O
get O
seated B-AS
, O
the O
burgers O
came O
without O
lettuce O
, O
they O
brougt O
us O
the O
wrong O
drinks B-AS
, O
and O
the O
flavor B-AS
of O
the O
burgers O
were O
below O
average O
. O

The O
menu B-AS
was O
in O
Italian O
- O
might O
as O
well O
have O
been O
in O
Esperanto O
; O
that O
put O
us O
at O
the O
mercy O
of O
the O
waiter B-AS
for O
recommendations O
. O

We O
too O
had O
reservations B-AS
but O
the O
gentleman B-AS
never O
checked O
a O
book O
to O
see O
our O
names O
or O
check O
us O
off O
. O

Dessert B-AS
was O
speedily O
served B-AS
as O
I O
still O
had O
a O
beer B-AS
to O
drink B-AS
and O
this O
is O
after O
I O
requested O
a O
few O
extra O
moments O
until O
it O
arrives O
. O

The O
prices B-AS
are O
reasonable O
but O
they O
don O
' O
t O
have O
a O
sushi B-AS
lunch I-AS
. O

Our O
server B-AS
( O
after O
4 O
reminders O
) O
finally O
got O
around O
to O
getting O
our O
cocktail B-AS
orders O
during O
the O
meal B-AS
( O
at O
a O
time O
when O
the O
establishment O
was O
not O
full O
) O
. O

Myself O
along O
with O
every O
other O
patron O
were O
forced O
to O
wait O
in O
an O
overcrowded O
bar B-AS
while O
employees B-AS
carry O
chairs B-AS
and O
such O
over O
our O
heads O
to O
prepare O
for O
dinner B-AS
in O
the O
next O
room O
, O
shoulder O
to O
shoulder O
we O
stood O
there O
like O
cattle B-AS
waiting I-AS
to O
be O
fed O
. O

The O
appetizer B-AS
, O
conch O
fritas B-AS
was O
yummy O
; O
entree O
, O
spicy B-AS
shrimp I-AS
with I-AS
coconut B-AS
rice I-AS
( O
just O
a O
hint O
of O
coconut O
- O
not O

) O
; O
and O
the O
dessert B-AS
tres I-AS
leches I-AS

ocho O
cafe O
was O
unbelievable O
! O

Generally O
, O
the O
food B-AS
was O
fine O
, O
but O
the O
table B-AS
is O
too O
small O
to O
eat O
comfortably O
. O

The O
tables B-AS
are O
close O
so O
you O
can O
hear O
every O
conversation O
going O
on O
around O
you O
, O
but O
if O
you O
' O
re O
here O
with O
someone O
who O
enthralls O
you O
, O
you O
will O
notice O
no O
one O
else O
but O
your O
dinner B-AS
date O
. O

The O
dinner O
menu O
promises O
creative O
- O
yet O
- O
comforting O
fare B-AS
, O
such O
as O
beef B-AS
brisket I-AS
in I-AS
a I-AS
red I-AS
wine I-AS
and O
fig O
sauce O
, O
panko B-AS
- I-AS
crusted I-AS
tofu I-AS
over I-AS
hijiki I-AS
salad I-AS
, O
and O
a O
six B-AS
- I-AS
spice I-AS
beef I-AS
burger I-AS
. O

We O
weren O
' O
t O
sure O
we O
' O
d O
even O
get O
a O
table B-AS
, O
surprisingly O
the O
lovely O
hostess B-AS
assured O
us O
she O
' O
d O
get O
us O
in O
if O
we O
gave O
her O
15 O
minutes O
in O
the O
bar B-AS
. O

even O
though O
he O
wasn O
' O
t O
our O
waiter B-AS
that O
evening O
, O
chris O
had O
2 O
glasses O
of O
champaigne O
sent O
over O
to O
our O
table O
and O
later O
on O
the O
manager B-AS
sent O
over O
a O
desert O
with O
a O
candle O
in O
it O
and O
congratulated O
us O
. O

Since O
it O
changed O
owners O
/ O
chefs O
, O
the O
portions B-AS
are O
smaller O
( O
I O
always O
used O
to O
ask O
for O
a O
doggie O
bag O
for O
my O
chic O
- O
parm O
) O
, O
now O
I O
can O
finish O
and O
still O
be O
hungry O
even O
after O
appetizers B-AS
( O
which O
aren O
' O
t O
as O
good O
anymore O
) O
. O

When O
I O
go O
out O
for O
dinner B-AS
which O
is O
quite O
often O
, O
I O
have O
never O
encountered O
such O
rudeness O
from O
a O
waiter B-AS
or O
owner B-AS
as O
I O
did O
at O
this O
smoke B-AS
filled O
, O
tight O
spaced O
, O
cash O
only O
restaurant O
. O

The O
menu B-AS
reads O
well O
, O
and O
it O
sounds O
like O
the O
chef B-AS
knows O
whats O
up O
. O

My O
favorite O
is O
a O
dish B-AS
I O
' O
ve O
treasured O
since O
childhood O
, O
linguine O
with O
white B-AS
clam I-AS
sauce I-AS
, O
cooked O
with O
pepperoncino B-AS
. O

The O
decor B-AS
was O
mediocre O
and O
honestly O
, O
I O
can O
get O
a O
better O
brunch B-AS
at O
a O
Cracker O
Barrel O
restaurant O
. O

We O
ended O
up O
hanging O
out O
for O
a O
few O
hours O
at O
their O
bar B-AS
with O
a O
staff B-AS
that O
we O
felt O
like O
we O
' O
ve O
known O
for O
years O
. O

The O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
rushed O
us O
through O
our O
meal B-AS
, O
took O
away O
our O
food O
before O
we O
were O
finished O
( O
even O
though O
we O
told O
them O
we O
were O
still O
eating O
) O
and O
then O
, O
as O
we O
were O
lingering O
over O
the O
bill B-AS
, O
asked O
us O
to O
leave O
. O

The O
kitchen B-AS
finds O
success O
with O
classics O
like O
a O
homemade O
, O
cognac B-AS
- I-AS
rich I-AS
duck I-AS
terrine I-AS
and O
well B-AS
- I-AS
seasoned I-AS
steak I-AS
frites I-AS
( O
although O
the O
fries B-AS
tend O
to O
be O
heavily O
salted O
) O
. O

We O
went O
ot O
Al O
di O
La O
a O
bit O
earlier O
than O
we O
usually O
go O
to O
dinner B-AS
, O
mainly O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
reservations B-AS
are O
not O
accepted O
. O

The O
menu B-AS
offers O
all O
the O
usuals O
: O
inexpensive O
spring B-AS
rolls I-AS
, O
vegetable B-AS
sweet O

its O

of O
people O
or O
with O
a O
date O
for O
maybe O
a O
mild O
dinner B-AS
or O
some O

The O
Food B-AS
Outstanding O
soup B-AS
choices I-AS
include O
the O
chicken B-AS

which O

egg I-AS

with I-AS

, I-AS
potatoes I-AS

all O
in O
a O
spicy O

Diners B-AS

large O
tables O
where O
chefs B-AS
ostentatiously O
chop O
, O
slice O
, O
stir O

and O

. O

When O
there O
is O
so O
much O
GREAT O
food B-AS
in O
New O
York O
, O
why O
go O
for O
the O
high O
- O
priced O
mediocre O
meal B-AS
? O

get O
the O
mussels B-AS
as O
an O
appetizer B-AS
and O
try O
to O
save O
room O
for O
dessert B-AS
. O

In O
the O
dim B-AS
lighting I-AS
, O
I O
thought O
the O
portions B-AS
were O
impressive O
and O
dug O
in O
. O

I O
guess O
Mars O
2112 O
keeps O
the O
food B-AS
bland O
for O
the O
family B-AS
fare I-AS
, O
but O
it O
only O
serves O
to O
detract O
from O
its O
overall O
experience O
. O

more O
like O

than O
dinner B-AS

and O
not O
just O
because O
of O
the O

Knew O
we O
were O
in O
trouble O
when O
the O
waiter B-AS
spilled O
our O
cocktails B-AS
on O
the O
table B-AS

couldn O

food B-AS
. O

One O
of O
the O
best O
things O
about O
this O
place O
are O
the O
appetizers B-AS
, O
since O
they O
have O
so O
many O
unique O
things O
to O
choose O
from O
( O
I O
always O
get O
the O
clams B-AS
and O
the O
zucchini B-AS
! O
) O

Food B-AS
presented O
well O
and O
the O
service O
once O
we O
were O
seated B-AS
was O
great O
but O
we O
had O
a O
long O
wait B-AS
for O
our O
table O
( O
about O
half O
an O
hour O
) O
even O
though O
I O
had O
pre O
- O
booked O
. O

From O
the O
outside O
this O
place B-AS
looks O
cute O
, O
however O
, O
once O
inside O
loud O
as O
a O
disco B-AS
! O

And O
while O
a O
narrow O
wood B-AS
counter I-AS
and O
three O
stools O
provide O
desperation O
seating B-AS
, O
most O
folks O
choose O
to O
take O
lunch B-AS
and O
dinner B-AS
to O
go O
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
was O
pretty O
anxious O
to O
get O
us O
in O
- O
and O
- O
out O
, O
although O
there O
were O
ample O
tables B-AS
and O
my O
friend O
and O
I O
opted O
to O
sit O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
. O

This O
is O
the O
perfect O
spot B-AS
to O
meet O
up O
with O
friends O
and O
have O
a O
drink B-AS
at O
the O
bar B-AS
or O
stay O
a O
while O
and O
enjoy O
the O
scene B-AS
and O
savor O
the O
food B-AS
. O

Although O
the O
portions B-AS
seemed O
a O
little O
diminutive O
at O
first O
, O
they O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
the O
perfect O
size O
once O
the O
dinner B-AS
was O
over O
. O

Once O
we O
were O
seated O
our O
water B-AS
order I-AS
was O
taken O
promptly O
but O
they O
never O
came O
back O
with O
a O
menu B-AS
. O

You O
must O
eat O
the O
cheese B-AS
fondue I-AS
( O
I O
usually O
have O
a O
special O
one O
- O
my O
favorite O
was O
made O
with O
carmelized O
onions B-AS
) O
with O
medium O
rare O
beef B-AS
tips I-AS
! O

We O
went O
at O
1 O
am O
, O
we O
got O
food B-AS
, O
fast O
service B-AS
and O
Excellent O
drinks O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
since O
been O
back O
for O
a O
regular O
dining B-AS
night O
out O
, O
it O
was O
packed O
and O
I O
should O
have O
made O
a O
reservation B-AS
( O
the O
wait B-AS
was O
a O
little O
long O
) O
. O

they O
made O
a O
good O
mojito O
, O
but O
the O
first O
bite O
of O
food O
, O
our O
appetizer B-AS
, O
black B-AS
pepper I-AS
crab I-AS
dumplings I-AS
were O
so O
bad O
that O
they O
rendered O
my O
palate O
useless O
, O
seriously O
, O
and O
we O
had O
to O
cut O
our O
dinner B-AS
short O
and O
wash O
our O
mouths O
out O
with O
soap O
. O

When O
we O
sat O
, O
our O
dinner B-AS
was O
delivered O
promplty O
( O
Like O
FAST O
) O
and O
we O
had O
plenty O
of O
time O
to O
make O
The O
Goat B-AS
, O
which O
by O
the O
way O
I O
also O
recommend O
highly O
( O
Great O
Show O
! O

So O
, O
if O
you O
don O
' O
t O
care O
about O
speedy O
service B-AS
, O
go O
; O
but O
if O
you O
aren O
' O
t O
in O
the O
habit O
of O
lighting O
your O
cigarette O
with O
twenties O
, O
avoid O
the O
tapas B-AS
. O

Service B-AS
is O
not O
particularly O
warm O
, O
but O
I O
' O
ve O
gone O
back O
again O
and O
again O
( O
for O
dinner B-AS
) O
over O
the O
years O
on O
an O
almost O
monthly O
basis O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
not O
large O
and O
I O
could O
have O
had O
a O
few O
slices B-AS
of O
pizza O
after O
I O
left O
. O

As O
for O
the O
food B-AS
, O
apart O
from O
the O
Chef B-AS
' O
s O
Omakase O
, O
the O
appetizers B-AS
and O
rolls O
are O
just O
below O
mediocre O
for O
the O
price B-AS
they O
charged O
. O

He O
was O
not O
accommodating O
at O
all O
and O
the O
handful O
of O
dishes B-AS
I O
sampled O
that O
night O
failed O
to O
compare O
to O
anything O
you O
would O
find O
elsewhere O
in O
the O
city O
for O
less O
than O
half O
the O
price B-AS
. O

sort O
of O
crouched O
in O
a O
chair B-AS
, O
leaning O
over O
a O
table B-AS
, O
while O
someone O
did O
that O
obnoxious O
karate O
chop B-AS
sort O
of O
thing O
on O
her O
back O
for O
way O
too O
long O
. O

I O
called O
ahead O
and O
was O
told O
that O
there O
would O
be O
no O
problem O
seating B-AS
a O
party O
of O
two O
at O
5 O
: O
30 O
, O
arrived O
at O
5 O
: O
30 O
, O
was O
told O
there O
would O
be O
a O
5 O
to O
10 O
minute O
wait B-AS
. O

If O
you O
consider O
throwing O
food B-AS
at O
your O
when O
they O
remember O
good O
service B-AS
, O
then O
go O
for O
it O
. O

There O
was O
no O
price B-AS
on O
the O
menu B-AS
and O
the O
waitress B-AS
recommended O
it O
. O

Appetizers B-AS
were O
by O
far O
the O
best O
, O
entrees B-AS
were O
subpar O
but O
desserts O
were O
sublime O
. O

I O
went O
into O
the O
buffet O
style O
ordering O
counter O
, O
got O
my O
plate O
and O
was O
surprised O
when O
I O
bit O
into O
a O
cold O
plate B-AS
of I-AS
chicken I-AS
and O
sweet O
potato B-AS
. O

I O
usually O
order O
the O
specials B-AS
but O
if O
not O
there O
are O
at O
least O
5 O
great O
dishes B-AS
that O
I O
would O
choose O
from O
any O
given O
night O
. O

My O
friend O
and O
I O
did O
have O
to O
wait O
a O
few O
minutes O
for O
a O
table B-AS
, O
but O
only O
because O
Amanda O
Hesser O
( O
the O
new O
NY O
Times O
food B-AS
critic O
) O
showed O
up O
and O
, O
obviously O
, O
needed O
a O
copious O
level O
of O
attention O
from O
the O
greetings O
staff B-AS
. O

PLUS O
the O
best O
wine B-AS
can O
be O
found O
in O
the O
bar B-AS
but O
they O
refused O
to O
sell O
us O
a O
bottle O
! O
! O

The O
waiter B-AS
came O
back O
after O
I O
had O
finished O
my O
appetizer B-AS
to O
correct O
himself O
and O
let O
me O
know O
that O
it O
wasn O
' O
t O
vegetarian O
( O
chicken O
stock O
) O
after O
all O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
great O
but O
the O
music O
was O
loud O
and O
hip O
- O
hop O
and O
the O
wait B-AS
was O
ridiculous O
and O
the O
prices O
were O
out O
of O
this O
world O
. O

For O
appetizers B-AS
, O
I O
' O
d O
recommend O
the O
crab O
napolean O
or O
the O
monkfish B-AS
mousse I-AS
. O

Anyway O
the O
food B-AS
was O
really O
good O
, O
the O
portions B-AS
are O
not O
big O
however O
very O
filling O
and O
exceptionally O
good O
. O

We O
were O
planning O
to O
get O
dessert B-AS
but O
the O
waitress B-AS
basically O
through O
the O
bill O
at O
us O
before O
we O
had O
a O
chance O
to O
order O
. O

from O
drinks O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
, O
to O
our O
perfect O
round B-AS
table I-AS
! O

Do O
not O
go O
to O
this O
restaurant O
unless O
you O
like O
paying O
high O
prices B-AS
for O
small O
protions O
, O
ordering O
a O
drink B-AS
that O
arrives O
20 O
minutes O
later O
, O
or O
ordering O
a O
meal O
only O
to O
get O
the O
side O
dish O
5 O
minutes O
after O
you O
' O
re O
done O
. O

The O
waitstaff B-AS
told O
us O
that O
they O
had O
already O
run O
out O
of O
one O
of O
the O
entrees B-AS
( O
before O
8 O
p O
. O

We O
waited O
for O
1 O
hour O
each O
time O
the O
waitress B-AS
came O
over O
to O
our O
table B-AS
. O

You O
can O
' O
t O
go O
wrong O
with O
any O
of O
the O
mojitos B-AS
and O
the O
food B-AS
is O
very O
tasty O
and O
presented O
beautifully O
. O

Our O
booth B-AS
style I-AS
seats I-AS
would O
' O
ve O
been O
more O
romantic O
if O
our O
waitress B-AS
, O
though O
nice O
, O
was O
less O
intrusive O
, O
and O
the O
loud O
music O
from O
its O
bar B-AS
didn O
' O
t O
filter O
thru O
so O
much O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
then O
rushed O
unappealing O
never O
once O
were O
we O
asked O
if O
we O
' O
d O
like O
a O
a O
second O
bottle O
of O
water O
let O
alone O
a O
second O
drink B-AS
. O

They O
pray O
to O
their O
Food B-AS
Gods O
to O
make O
them O
into O
a O
good O
pizza B-AS
like O
VT O
' O
s O
. O

Heck O
even O
if O
they O
had O
awful O
service B-AS
and O
atmosphere B-AS
I O
would O
still O
come O
to O
this O
place O
for O
their O
dumplings B-AS
, O
luckly O
that O
is O
not O
the O
case O
. O

The O
chef B-AS
will O
not O
alter O
any O
of O
the O
three O
tasting O
menus B-AS
. O

I O
went O
with O
two O
friends O
and O
had O
the O
smores O
bar B-AS
- O
two O
yummy O
chocolate B-AS
chip I-AS
cookies I-AS
with O
marshmallows B-AS
and O
chocolate O
melted O
between O
, O
and O
they O
serve O
it O
piping O
hot O
! O

The O
crowd B-AS
was O
non O
- O
existent O
on O
the O
Wednesday O
we O
went O
, O
which O
had O
the O
advantage O
of O
no O
wait B-AS
for O
our O
table O
( O
even O
though O
we O
called O
an O
hour O
early O
and O
they O
said O
they O
only O
have O
a O
reservation B-AS
for O
9 O
: O
00 O
pm O
) O
. O

the O
trendy O
atmosphere B-AS
and O
high O
price B-AS
fooled O
me O
into O
thinking O
that O
somehow O
the O
food O
would O
be O
innovative O
. O

Maybe O
go O
there O
for O
the O
view B-AS
, O
but O
don O
' O
t O
bother O
eating O
there O
, O
go O
to O
the O
bar B-AS
. O

Every O
time O
I O
eat O
there O
I O
feel O
as O
if O
the O
chef O
and O
waitstaff B-AS
have O
cooked O
, O
prepared O
and O
served O
a O
meal B-AS
as O
if O
I O
am O
the O
only O
customer O
/ O
guest O
. O

staff B-AS
is O
still O
working O
out O
their O
kinks O
and O
learning O
about O
the O
menu B-AS
but O
no O
real O
complaints O
. O

Excellent O
Steaks B-AS
, O
the O
attitude B-AS
of O
the O
Servers B-AS
could O
be O
a O
little O
better O
but O
the O
food B-AS
makes O
up O
for O
everything O
. O

The O
service B-AS
is O
sweet O
and O
attentive O
, O
the O
wine O
is O
delicious O
and O
the O
new B-AS
wine I-AS
bar I-AS
around O
the O
corner O
has O
the O
most O
amazing O
selection B-AS
, O
as O
well O
as O
cheeses B-AS
and O
tapas B-AS
. O

Apparently O
the O
same O
hostess B-AS
was O
also O
trying O
to O
kick O
out O
a O
group O
of O
women O
having O
drinks B-AS
at O
a O
table O
and O
giving O
them O
a O
hard O
time O
for O
holding O
up O
a O
table O
. O

As O
appetizers B-AS
we O
enjoyed O
the O
Drunken B-AS
Goat I-AS
Cheese I-AS
Salad I-AS
and O
Lobster B-AS
Empanadas I-AS
. O

I O
ordered O
pasta B-AS
in O
a B-AS
pomodoro I-AS
sauce I-AS
and O
it O
tasted O
like O
it O
came O
out O
of O
a O
can O
. O

We O
placed O
a O
delivery B-AS
order O
- O
2 O
pastas O
and O
a O
caprese O
and O
they O
took O
and O
1 O
1 O
/ O
2 O
to O
get O
here O
and O
the O
food B-AS
was O
inedible O
when O
we O
received O
it O
. O

The O
waiters B-AS
were O
getting O
a O
wine B-AS
class O
from O
a O
very O
loud O
manager B-AS
and O
ignoring O
all O
the O
patrons B-AS
- O
someone O
should O
have O
been O
giving O
them O
a O
class O
on O
serving O
instead O
. O

My O
dining B-AS
partner O
ordered O
the O
turkey B-AS
burger I-AS
and O
declared O
this O
also O
to O
be O
the O
best O
one O
ever O
. O

There O
were O
6 O
servers B-AS
standing O
around O
watching O
me O
eat O
but O
they O
never O
asked O
if O
I O
needed O
anything O
or O
even O
offered O
me O
water B-AS
. O

The O
menu B-AS
was O
nicely O
sized O
with O
five O
small O
plates B-AS
, O
eight O
appetizers B-AS
and O
seven O
entrees B-AS
. O

But O
the O
appetizer O
is O
a O
litlle O
pricey O
, O
especialy O
$ O
6 O
for O
3 O
pieces O
sushi B-AS
, O
but O
iutside O
that O
it O
was O
a O
great O
experience O
, O
food B-AS
was O
great O
, O
and O
not O
too O
costly O
over O
all O
. O

I O
don O
' O
t O
mind O
paying O
a O
high O
price B-AS
for O
a O
really O
good O
meal B-AS
, O
but O
this O
was O
really O
average O
food B-AS
. O

As O
the O
afternoon O
progresses O
, O
you O
' O
ll O
see O
as O
many O
waitstaff B-AS
as O
customers O
scurrying O
after O
food B-AS
carts I-AS
with I-AS
bill I-AS
cards O
in O
hand O
, O
clutching O
stacks O
of O
steamers O
back O
to O
their O
tables B-AS
. O

The O
food O
and O
beer B-AS
make O
up O
for O
it O
, O
but O
it O
would O
be O
nice O
if O
the O
staff B-AS
weren O
' O
t O
such O
buzz O
kills O
! O

Didn O
' O
t O
have O
room O
for O
dessert B-AS
, O
but O
will O
definitely O
be O
back O
to O
try O
the O
coconut B-AS
mousse I-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
did O
not O
come O
out O
on O
time O
or O
together O
and O
the O
waiter B-AS
never O
came O
to O
explain O
why O
. O

Midway O
through O
the O
meal B-AS
the O
waiter B-AS
came O
over O
and O
said O
we O
were O
being O
charged O
$ O
40 O
a O
head O
since O
there O
were O
7 O
of O
us O
, O
and O
they O
never O
said O
that O
when O
i O
made O
the O
reservation B-AS
. O

Silky O
black O
bass O
with O
porcini O
mushrooms O
carries O
smoky O
, O
earthy O
and O
buttery O
overtones O
that O
somehow O
never O
overpower O
the O
fish B-AS
, O
and O
whole O
- O
roasted O
baby O
pig O
includes O
belly O
meat O
, O
braised B-AS
for O
24 O
hours O
in O
five O
spice O
- O
ginger O
glaze O
, O
and O
yet O
the O
pork B-AS
flavor I-AS
is O
still O
fully O
present O
. O

I O
had O
their O
eggs B-AS
benedict I-AS
for O
brunch B-AS
, O
which O
were O
the O
worst O
in O
my O
entire O
life O
, O
I O
tried O
removing O
the O
hollondaise B-AS
sauce I-AS
completely O
that O
was O
how O
failed O
it O
was O
. O

However O
, O
the O
cheese O
fondue O
had O
too O
much O
wine B-AS
and O
not O
enough O
cheese O
, O
the O
escargot B-AS
was O
too O
stewy O
and O
the O
salmon O
was O
very O
average O
. O

Our O
waitress B-AS
bought O
us O
a O
round O
of O
after O
drinks B-AS
too O
. O

Our O
waiter B-AS
told O
us O
he O
knew O
all O
the O
wines B-AS
on O
it O
quite O
well O
, O
and O
he O
did O
! O

Seating B-AS
is O
limited O
, O
so O
you O
will O
probably O
want O
to O
order O
take O
- O
out O
, O
but O
a O
better O
take B-AS
- I-AS
out I-AS
pizza I-AS
you O
will O
not O
find O
! O

This O
place B-AS
is O
so O
unexpected O
, O
just O
a O
tiny O
little O
bar B-AS
, O
but O
it O
serves O
dinner O
and O
even O
a O
really O
good O
weekend O
brunch B-AS
. O

For O
the O
money B-AS
, O
it O
' O
s O
a O
dependable O
and O
fun O
place B-AS
to O
get O
sushi B-AS
- O
bring O
friends O
and O
share O
the O
2 O
for O
1 O
rolls B-AS
( O
they O
have O
to O
be O
2 O
of O
the O
same O
. O

the O
filet B-AS
came O
out O
and O
was O
absolutely O
delicious O
, O
on O
a O
bed O
of O
julienned B-AS
vegetables I-AS
in O
a O
balsamic B-AS
vinagarette I-AS
sauce I-AS
. O

I O
went O
to O
Ciao O
on O
a O
Saturday O
evening O
and O
the O
food B-AS
was O
not O
up O
to O
the O
price B-AS
asked O
for O
. O

As O
for O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
I O
' O
ve O
never O
been O
disappointed O
, O
but O
the O
Margarita B-AS
chicken I-AS
salad I-AS
is O
my O
favorite O
. O

Then O
the O
staff B-AS
behind O
the O
buffett O
just O
haven O
' O
t O
gotten O
their O
groove O
yet O
, O
so O
you O
order O
your O
food B-AS
and O
wait O
five O
minutes O
while O
it O
sits O
behind O
the O
glass B-AS
on O
a O
plate O
, O
getting O
cold O
. O

Basically O
traditional O
menu B-AS
could O
have O
been O
boring O
and O
old O
- O
fashioned O
, O
but O
is O
instead O
updated O
enough O
to O
please O
modern O
palate O
: O
steaks O
, O
seafood O
, O
fish O
, O
poultry O
- O
ample O
portions B-AS
( O
we O
took O
half O
home O
) O
, O
seasoned O
with O
care O
and O
imagination O
. O

Disappointed O
in O
the O
selection O
on O
the O
restaurant O
week O
menu B-AS
( O
which O
did O
not O
include O
any O
steak B-AS
entrees I-AS
) O
but O
impressed O
with O
the O
actual O
food O
- O
everything O
was O
very O
good O
- O
fresh O
and O
innovative O
- O
saffron O
risotto O
was O
not O
too O
powerful O
and O
the O
entrees O
were O
all O
good O
. O

You O
' O
d O
expect O
one O
to O
have O
more O
dessert B-AS
options I-AS
, O
other O
than O
rice B-AS
pudding I-AS
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
returned O
seconds O
later O
to O
complain O
that O
dozens O
of O
people O
wanted O
our O
table B-AS
then O
poured O
her O
beer O
into O
a O
paper O
cup B-AS
- O
- O
presumably O
to O
encourage O
us O
to O
leave O
faster O
. O

The O
mac B-AS
and I-AS
cheese I-AS
is O
to O
die O
for O
as O
are O
many O
other O
main O
dishes B-AS
including O
the O
pork B-AS
ribs I-AS
, O
roast O
chicken O
and O
traditional O
spaghetti O
meatballs O
. O

The O
first O
course O
of O
scallops B-AS
and I-AS
caviar I-AS
coupled I-AS
with I-AS
celery I-AS
seemed O
very O
bland O
and O
left O
me O
totally O
under O
whelmed O
; O
the O
immense O
use O
of O
oil O
, O
coupled O
with O
the O
over O
cooked B-AS
vegetables I-AS
, O
left O
my O
fish B-AS
entre O
inedible O
. O

The O
food O
is O
mediocre O
, O
burgers B-AS
are O
ok O
, O
the O
pizza B-AS
tastes O
like O
the O
box O
it O
' O
s O
delivered O
in O
. O

perhaps O
the O
place B-AS
is O
better O
after O
the O
theatre B-AS
crowd I-AS
is O
gone O
but O
we O
were O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
it O
and O
it O
wasn O
' O
t O
a O
very O
enjoyable O
experience O
. O

Great O
place B-AS
to O
go O
for O
a O
lunch B-AS
date O
or O
for O
coffee B-AS
after O
a O
date O
. O

At O
lunch B-AS
, O
try O
something O
with O
chicken B-AS
. O

Service B-AS
was O
a O
little O
slow O
, O
but O
going O
on O
a O
Monday O
night O
during O
the O
Brooklyn O
Restaurant O
Week O
, O
where O
20 O
bucks O
each O
got O
a O
friend O
and O
I O
appetizer B-AS
, O
entree O
, O
and O
dessert B-AS
was O
phenomenal O
. O

The O
overpriced O
food O
that O
' O
s O
supposed O
to O
come O
off O
as O
homestyle O
diner B-AS
just O
doesn O
' O
t O
work O
when O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
supposed O
to O
be O
super O
cool O
but O
the O
food O
is O
super O
bland O
. O

When O
the O
spastic O
waiter B-AS
finally O
stopped O
by O
our O
table B-AS
, O
we O
told O
him O
we O
were O
going O
to O
order O
everything O
at O
once O
b O
/ O
c O
we O
were O
getting O
pretty O
hungry O
. O

To O
top O
it O
off O
, O
when O
we O
mentioned O
it O
to O
our O
lovely O
waitress B-AS
, O
she O
responded O
as O
though O
it O
was O
no O
big O
deal O
along O
with O
Well O
now O
you O
know O
for O
the O
next O
time B-AS
. O

Prime B-AS
Rib I-AS
was O
cold O
and O
very O
fatty O
- O
- O
Drinks B-AS
were O
good O
though O
- O
- O
Very O
expensive O
- O
- O
I O
' O
ve O
had O
much O
better O
for O
less O
. O

Our O
oh O
- O
so O
- O
chic O
waitress B-AS
obstained O
from O
half O
the O
items O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
( O
give O
me O
a O
break O
) O
so O
she O
couldn O
' O
t O
make O
subjective O
recommendations O
. O

dips O
, O
lamd O
shops O
, O
beans B-AS
, O
fresh O
fish B-AS
. O

The O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
was O
not O
as O
attentive O
as O
I O
would O
have O
liked O
, O
we O
had O
to O
ask O
several O
times O
for O
water O
and O
refills O
of O
water O
, O
and O
after O
the O
food B-AS
was O
served O
, O
no O
one O
returned O
to O
check O
on O
us O
. O

the O
food B-AS
was O
pretty O
nice O
, O
but O
it O
' O
s O
on O
the O
expensive O
side B-AS
. O

We O
ended O
the O
dinner B-AS
with O
a O
surprisingly O
light O
and O
flaky O
apple B-AS
tarte I-AS
tatin I-AS
. O

at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
meal O
the O
hostess B-AS
came O
to O
us O
and O
rudely O
ask O
us O
to O
leave O
the O
table B-AS
, O
we O
were O
astonished O
by O
her O
attitude O
. O

For O
the O
price B-AS
and O
quality O
of O
the O
food B-AS
, O
the O
service B-AS
should O
have O
been O
a O
lot O
better O
than O
it O
was O
. O

The O
only O
drawback O
is O
the O
need O
for O
reservations B-AS
around O
the O
typical O
pre O
- O
theatre O
times B-AS
. O

The O
bigger O
sin O
is O
the O
service O
- O
- O
our O
waiter B-AS
was O
late O
with O
our O
main B-AS
dishes I-AS
, O
late O
with O
the O
bill O
, O
which O
was O
totaled O
incorrectly O
( O
twice O
) O
. O

There O
is O
no O
waiting B-AS
area I-AS
, O
so O
we O
had O
a O
crowd O
hovering O
over O
our O
table B-AS
, O
this O
is O
just O
testament O
to O
how O
many O
people O
want O
to O
eat O
there O
. O

Our O
waiter B-AS
took O
our O
drink B-AS
orders O
and O
never O
came O
back O
! O

The O
Food B-AS
Surprisingly O
tasty O
Texas O
- O
style O
barbecue O
gives O
this O
place O
culinary O
flexibility O
beyond O
that O
of O
most O
wrap O
- O
and O
- O
burrito O
shacks B-AS
. O

We O
went O
in O
March O
' O
03 O
on O
Sunday O
- O
the O
food O
was O
just O
so O
- O
so O
, O
but O
we O
had O
to O
beg O
for O
a O
glass B-AS
of I-AS
water I-AS
( O
and O
never O
got O
it O
anyway O
) O
, O
but O
the O
worst O
part O
- O
the O
forks O
and O
knives O
were O
totally O
dirty O
( O
you O
could O
see O
someone O
' O
s O
scrambled O
eggs B-AS
on O
them O
) O
. O

he O
politely O
asked O
about O
what O
happened O
, O
we O
told O
him O
about O
the O
hostess O
behaviour O
, O
the O
manager B-AS
apologized O
for O
the O
her O
behavior O
and O
treated O
us O
to O
a O
drink B-AS
at O
the O
bar B-AS
. O

The O
space B-AS
is O
tiny O
and O
intimate O
, O
so O
if O
you O
score O
a O
table O
, O
or O
a O
good O
seat O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
, O
you O
' O
re O
set O
for O
the O
night O
. O

Went O
for O
dinner B-AS
around O
9pm O
on O
a O
Sunday O
night O
and O
sourdough O
bread B-AS
they O
brought O
right O
away O
was O
warmed O
to O
perfection O
and O
delicious O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
sampled O
several O
other O
dim B-AS
sum I-AS
places I-AS
here O
, O
and O
none O
feature O
the O
winning O
combination O
that O
Triple O

reasonable O
prices B-AS
, O
large O
range O
of O
standard O

and O

less O
common O
dim O
sum O
, O
little O
/ O
no O
wait B-AS
( O
not O
like O
the O
Mott O
St O
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
was O
constantly O
puching O
us O
to O
have O
drinks B-AS
, O
he O
told O
us O
that O
we O
were O
not O
ordering O
properly O
and O
insisted O
on O
bringing O
to O
the O
table O
his O
recommendations O
. O

We O
had O
to O
wait O
an O
hour O
before O
our O
food O
was O
served B-AS
, O
then O
another O
hour O
inbetween O
courses B-AS
, O
all O
the O
while O
whilst O
the O
staff B-AS
were O
naughtily O
hiding O
in O
an O
attempt O
to O
avoid O
our O
' O
where O
' O
s O
out O
food O
? O
' O

The O
Captain B-AS
was O
showing O
his O
impatience O
for O
a O
crowded O
Monday O
night O
and O
the O
dinner B-AS
I O
was O
served B-AS
was O
not O
prepared O
the O
way O
he O
told O
me O
it O
would O
be O
. O

not O
large O
portions B-AS
- O
my O
boyfriend O
' O
s O
entree B-AS
looked O
more O
like O
an O
appetizer B-AS
, O
and O
all O
we O
got O
out O
of O
the O
dinner B-AS
was O
a O
$ O
100 O
tab O
and O
hunger O
for O
more O
food B-AS
. O

The O
only O
con O
is O
the O
price B-AS
( O
$ O
110 O
for O
two O
people O
for O
a O
full O
meal B-AS
) O
. O

Their O
new O
style O
of O
all O
you O
can O
eat O
is O
: O
They O
bring O
barely O
enough O
food B-AS
for O
the O
table O
, O
mostly O
just O
bread O
, O
until O
you O
ask O
a O
waiter B-AS
to O
bring O
some O
more O
. O

I O
work O
nearby O
so O
I O
' O
ve O
eaten O
here O
countless O
times O
( O
breakfast O
, O
lunch O
, O
dinner O
, O
even O
Sunday O
brunch B-AS
) O
, O
and O
been O
to O
several O
really O
cool O
parties O
- O
- O
the O
food B-AS
' O
s O
delicious O
, O
and O
the O
setting B-AS
is O
spectacular O
. O

The O
atmosphere O
would O
have O
been O
almost O
perfect O
if O
it O
werent O
for O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
were O
seat O
right O
naext O
to O
the O
noisy O
kitchen B-AS
but O
I O
guess O
the O
speedy O
service B-AS
comes O
with O
a O
price O
. O

He O
roasts O
tomatoes B-AS
in O
the O
oven O
to O
make O
his O
fantastic O
sauce B-AS
. O

Multiple O
televisions O
on O
both O
sides O
of O
the O
cozy O
room O
ensure O
unobstructed O
sight O
lines B-AS
for O
fans O
, O
whether O
they O
' O
re O
sipping O
pints O
at O
the O
oak O
bar O
or O
snacking O
on O

and O
buffalo O

tall O

You O
can O
spend O
$ O
25 O

at O
a O
much O
fancier O
place B-AS
. O

Another O
hour O
waiting B-AS
for O
our O
food B-AS
, O
we O
spoke O
to O
the O
manager B-AS
, O
he O
told O
us O
he O
would O
give O
us O
a O
discount O
off O
our O
bill O
. O

I O
took O
a O
few O
clients O
for O
lunch B-AS
and O
the O
service B-AS
was O
lackluster O
, O
food O
was O
fair O
at O
best O
, O
and O
the O
prices O
were O
outrageous O
- O
Don O
' O
t O
wast O
your O
time O
with O
this O
place O
! O

Their O
yogurt B-AS
breads I-AS
are O
very O
good O
, O
but O
I O
wasn O
' O
t O
impressed O
with O
their O
sandwiches B-AS
. O

the O
sushi B-AS
was O
good O
and O
the O
service O
was O
not O
as O
bad O
as O
some O
would O
have O
you O
think O
but O
the O
crowd B-AS
was O
more O
business O
than O
hip O
, O
more O
wall O
st O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
only O
had O
take B-AS
- I-AS
out I-AS
from O
here O
but O
a O
couple O
of O
their O
dishes B-AS
, O
along O
with O
the O
spicy B-AS
green I-AS
and I-AS
orange I-AS
sauces I-AS
, O
are O
amazing O
. O

The O
prices B-AS
are O
up O
there O
without O
being O
over O
the O
top O
but O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
food B-AS
commands O
it O
. O

I O
ordered O
the O
empanadas O
sampler O
, O
crab B-AS
croqueta I-AS
, O
and O
something O
else O
I O
don O
' O
t O
remember O
but O
I O
remember O
( O
all O
appetizers B-AS
) O
thinking O
this O
was O
the O
best O
Cuban B-AS
meal I-AS
I O
had O
ever O
eaten O
. O

Recently O
, O
I O
celebrated O
my O
birthday O
at O
this O
restaurant O
- O
it O
was O
a O
brunch B-AS
for O
60 O
people O
, O
all O
of O
whom O
said O
the O
food B-AS
was O
exceptional O
. O

After O
admitting O
that O
the O
items O
on O
the O
bill B-AS
were O
not O
in O
line O
with O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
the O
manager B-AS
reserved O
the O
right O
to O
price B-AS
at O
her O
own O
discretion O
! O

There O
wasn O
' O
t O
even O
a O
decent O
waiting B-AS
area I-AS
- O
- O
on O
a O
Friday O
night O
the O
lounge B-AS
is O
full O
- O
- O
and O
when O
we O
tried O
to O
sit O
on O
the O
only O
available O
seating B-AS
( O
granite O
ledge O
outside O
of O
the O
restaurant O
) O
another O
bouncer O
w O
/ O
an O
earpiece O
told O
us O
to O
move O
. O

A O
reservation B-AS
did O
not O
save O
us O
from O
a O
wait O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
, O
but O
the O
food O
was O
worth O
it O
; O
a O
grilled B-AS
calamari I-AS
appetizier I-AS
with I-AS
mushrooms I-AS
was O
delicious O
as O
was O
a O
mixed B-AS
seafood I-AS
pasta I-AS
main I-AS
course I-AS
. O

that O
the O
waiting B-AS
is O
horrific O
but O
the O
food B-AS
is O
great O
. O

The O
place B-AS
is O
not O
meant O
for O
in O
house B-AS
dining I-AS
, O
but O
if O
you O
want O
to O
grab O
a O
meal B-AS
on O
the O
go O
, O
this O
is O
the O
perfect O
choice O
. O

service B-AS
, O
one O
would O
be O
overpaying O
for O
the O
experience O
and O
for O
the O
food B-AS
. O

The O
restauarnt B-AS
is O
Ok O
in O
terms O
of O
decor B-AS
, O
but O
the O
food B-AS
was O
really O
lacking O
- O
things O
were O
not O
cooked O
to O
order O
. O

The O
pricing B-AS
isn O
' O
t O
quite O
clear O
and O
look O
out O
for O
that O
asterisk O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
where O
they O
add O
on O
that O
extra O
6 O
- O
8 O
bucks O
. O

Party O
of O
4 O
after O
a O
Sunday O
matinee O
, O
no O
reservation B-AS
, O
seated B-AS
promtply O
, O
but O
service B-AS
was O
slow O
. O

The O
Happy O
Hour O
is O
the O
best O
I O
' O
ve O
ever O
been O
too O
, O
and O
the O
chocolate B-AS
chip I-AS
cookies I-AS
that O
are O
passed O
around O
throughout O
dinner B-AS
are O
to O
die O
for O
. O

The O
bartenders B-AS
could O
have O
been O
a O
lot O
nicer O
but O
the O
drinks B-AS
they O
shook O
up O
kind O
of O
made O
up O
for O
their O
poor O
attitude B-AS
. O

The O
Food O
The O
menu B-AS
is O
a O
paper O
buffet B-AS
- O
- O
pick O
your O
cut O
of O
meat B-AS
, O
dress O
it O
in O
either O
a O
sauce B-AS
or O
a O
baked O
- O
on O
chapeau O
and O
then O
pick O
accessories O
, O
such O
as O
Yukon O
gold B-AS
mashed I-AS
potatoes I-AS
, O
bitter O
greens B-AS
or I-AS
wilted I-AS
tomatoes I-AS
with I-AS
blue I-AS
cheese I-AS
. O

Our O
waiter B-AS
suggested O
a O
fantastic O
Greek B-AS
wine I-AS
that O
was O
far O
less O
expensive O
then O
we O
were O
willing O
to O
spend O
. O

Food B-AS
was O
much O
better O
then O
I O
had O
remembered O
( O
smaller O

Great O

The O
waiters B-AS
actually O
roll O
their O
eyes O
when O
you O
order O
something O
, O
as O
if O
you O
are O
imposing O
on O
them O
by O
ordering O
food B-AS

our O
waiter B-AS
noticed O
it O
was O
my O
bday O
w O
/ O
o O
me O
saying O
, O
and O
brought O
me O
cake O
w O
/ O
candles B-AS

She O
then O
sent O
over O
the O
owner B-AS
, O
and O
his O
only O
recourse O
was O
to O
give O
us O
a O
free O
bottle O
of O
sparkling B-AS
wine I-AS
. O

I O
didn O
' O
t O
know O
what O
to O
expect O
from O
Frankie O
and O
Johnnie O

when O
I O
made O
the O
reservation B-AS
after O
my O
friend O
told O
me O
it O
was O
the O
best O
steak B-AS
he O
had O
had O
. O

For O
the O
price B-AS
you O
pay O

you O
get O
good O
quality B-AS
and O

was O
not O

very O

fresh O

Although O
the O

was O
friendly O
, O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
was O
not O
. O

We O
decided O
on O
several O
appetizers B-AS
, O
the O
clear O
winner O
was O
the O
sardines B-AS
, O
something O
I O
normally O
wouldnt O
have O
tried O
. O

My O
companion O
went O
to O
the O
bathroom B-AS
and O
overheard O
the O
waiter B-AS
singing O
near O
the O
back O
of O
the O
place O
The O
cappuccino O
machine O
is O
broken O

It O

With O
so O
many O
$ O
20 O
bottles O
of O
wines B-AS
from O
which O
to O
choose O
, O
our O
waiter B-AS
helped O
pick O
a O
good O
one O
. O

From O
the O
overstuffed O
menu O
to O
the O
placemats O
advertising O
spectacularly O
festive O
drinks O
, O
to O
the O
comfy O
booths B-AS
, O
the O
decor B-AS
signals O
- O
- O
this O
is O
indeed O
your O
grandfather O
' O
s O
diner O
and O
thank O
goodness O
for O
it O
. O

Not O
only O
is O
there O
very O
little O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
besides O
steak B-AS
, O
but O
you O
really O
have O
no O
choice O
of O
what O
cut O
of O
meat B-AS
to O
get O
. O

The O
main O
meal O
, O
a O
red B-AS
snapper I-AS
, O
was O
not O
bad O
, O
but O
after O
hoping O
I O
would O
experience O
a O
true O
spanish O
experience O
, O
the O
remaining B-AS
dinner I-AS
lost O
its O
appeal O
. O

The O
only O
complaints O
( O
minor O
) O
was O
a O
15 O
minute O
wait B-AS
when O
we O
had O
a O
10 O
PM O
reservation B-AS
and O
the O
tables B-AS
are O
pretty O
close O
to O
one O
another O
. O

After O
a O
couple O
of O
drinks B-AS
upstairs O
before O
our O
meal O
, O
we O
slipped O
downstairs O
to O
a O
nice O
corner B-AS
table I-AS
that O
offered O
plenty O
of O
privacy O
in O
this O
' O
loud O
' O
place O
. O

Although O
tiramisu B-AS
was O
ordered O
on O
every O
other O
table O
, O
and O
looked O
very O
yummy O
, O
at O
the O
end O
of O
our O
meal B-AS
I O
was O
simply O
too O
full O
to O
try O

not O

ALL O
the O

the O

I O
came O
in O
for O
brunch B-AS
with O
my O
parents B-AS
on O
Saturday O
and O
the O
place B-AS
was O
packed O
. O

The O
staff B-AS
was O
gracious O
enough O
to O
keep O
her O
arrival O
a O
secret O
by O
letting O
us O
wait O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
and O
holding O
our O
table O
for O
us O
until O
she O
and O
our O
father O
arrived O
45 O
minutes O
late O
( O
delayed O

) O
. O

My O
wife O
and O
I O
, O
from O
Houston O
, O
and O
another O
couple O
from O
Conneticut O
were O
visiting O
Manhattan O
for O
the O
weekend O
and O
I O
chose O
Shula O
' O
s O
for O
dinner B-AS
because O
I O
had O
heard O
that O
it O
was O
a O
good O
steak B-AS
house I-AS
. O

I O
would O
wait O
for O
a O
table B-AS
next O
time O
, O
the O
food B-AS
was O
that O
good O
. O

Also O
excellent O
is O
the O
okonomiyaki O
, O
a O
tangy O
cabbage B-AS
, O
pork B-AS
and O
shrimp B-AS
frittata I-AS
topped I-AS
with O
bonito O
flakes O
and O
a O
dollop O
of O
mayonnaise B-AS
. O

My O
sashimi B-AS
was O
just O
ok O
with O
very O
little O
flavor O
from O
the O
sauces B-AS
they O
supposedly O
put O
on O
them O
and O
the O
napolean O
had O
something O
that O
stuck O
out O
in O
the O
flavor O
, O
not O
in O
a O
good O
way O
. O

The O
simple O
corn B-AS
tamale I-AS
comes O
with O
a O
mild O
homemade B-AS
sour I-AS
cream I-AS
, O
and O
the O
inexpensive O
enchiladas O
, O
prepared O
with O
expertly O
spiced B-AS
strips I-AS
of O
beef O
, O
could O
easily O
serve O
as O
an O
entree B-AS
. O

They O
make O
pizza B-AS
the O
way O
you O
should O
with O
lots O
of O
sauce B-AS
. O

We O
ordered O
a O
platter B-AS
that O
was O
an O
asssortment O
of O
appetizers B-AS
which O
was O
great O
recomendation O
. O

Choppy O
service B-AS
with O
a O
bit O
of O
attitude O
thrown O
in O
- O
when O
we O
asked O
for O
the O
restaurant O
week O
prix O
fix O
menus B-AS
the O
aiter O
made O
a O
face O
. O

The O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
while O
attentive O
did O
nothing O
to O
address O
the O
hair O
that O
was O
found O
in O
one O
of O
our O
dishes B-AS
. O

I O
had O
the O
tuna B-AS
, O
which O
tasted O
like O
dead O
fish B-AS
that O
laid O
in O
the O
sun O
for O
3 O
wks O
. O

After O
waiting O
an O
hour O
and O
a O
half O
, O
a O
delivery B-AS
man I-AS
- O
with O
heavily O
bleeding O
gums O
- O
told O
me O
not O
to O
worry O
, O
that O
my O
meal B-AS
had O
been O
replaced O
with O
fresh O
food O
, O
and O
that O
my O
old O
order O
had O
been O
RE O
- O
SERVED O
to O
another O
customer O
. O

The O
service B-AS
sucks O
every O
time O
, O
but O
the O
food B-AS
is O
usually O
tasty O
, O
even O
though O
the O
menu O
leans O
toward O
the O
boring O
and O
expected O
of O
French B-AS
fare I-AS
. O

Get O
it O
served O
with O
rice B-AS
and I-AS
vegetables I-AS
( O
yummy O
) O
, O
some O
house O
red B-AS
wine I-AS
, O
nice O
big O
plate B-AS
of O
tzatziki O
, O
saganaki O
and O
you O
' O
ll O
be O
in O
heaven O
. O

Waiter B-AS
had O
to O
lean O
on O
my O
husband O
to O
give O
people O
next O
to O
us O
their O
food B-AS
. O

In O
fact O
, O
our O
waiter B-AS
mis O
- O
pronounced O
many O
of O
the O
items O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
. O

Their O
menu B-AS
has O
just O
been O
updated O
featuring O
new B-AS
rolls I-AS
and O
more O
choices O
. O

the O
foods B-AS
so O
tasty O
( O
the O
soup B-AS
maybe O
a O
little O
blandbut O
ill O
forgive O
them O
only O
because O
everything O
else O
is O
out O
of O
this O
world O
. O

This O
place O
basically O
has O
the O
same O
menu B-AS
as O
Penang O
but O
everything O
is O
cheaper O
, O
including O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
. O

The O
turkey B-AS
burgers I-AS
are O
thick O
and O
juicy O
and O
they O
pile O
the O
mushrooms B-AS
on O
! O

When O
the O
bill O
came O
, O
the O
waiter B-AS
snatched O
it O
back O
so O
he O
could O
add O
the O
$ O
3 O
difference O
to O
the O
wine B-AS
. O

Bread B-AS
had O
a O
oil B-AS
on O
it O
so O
it O
was O
messy O
. O

To O
sum O
it O
up O
: O
Service B-AS
varies O
from O
good O
to O
mediorce O
, O
depending O
on O
which O
waiter B-AS
you O
get O
; O
generally O
it O
is O
just O
average O
Ok O
. O

I O
didn O
' O
t O
take O
a O
look O
at O
the O
rest O
menu B-AS
, O
but O
the O
oysters B-AS
were O
fantastic O
. O

Before O
we O
can O
even O
order O
desert O
, O
the O
waitress B-AS
comes O
and O
tells O
us O
we O
have O
to O
leave O
because O
the O
host O
wanted O
our O
table B-AS
. O

I O
ordered O
their O
famous O
buffalo B-AS
steak I-AS
which O
originally O
would O
come O
with O
homemade O
potatoe B-AS
gnocchi I-AS
but O
I O
chose O
the O
sauteed O
spinach B-AS
with I-AS
garlic I-AS
instead O
, O
which O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
exceptional O
. O

Everything O
we O
had O
from O
the O
scallop B-AS
starter I-AS
to O
the O
rare O
ribeye O
, O
right O
through O
dessert B-AS
was O
impeccible O
. O

The O
bread O
was O
served B-AS
, O
one O
razor O
thin O
slice O
on O
our O
bread O
plate O
, O
by O
the O
waiter B-AS
. O

Food B-AS
and O
service B-AS
were O
very O
good O
but O
prices B-AS
were O
a O
bit O
high O
for O
the O
portions B-AS
. O

My O
wife O
I O
went O
here O
for O
a O
Birthday O
dinner B-AS
and O
were O
immediately O
impressed O
with O
the O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
. O

I O
asked O
the O
captain B-AS
to O
bring O
the O
food B-AS
in O
separate O
bags O
and O
he O
loudly O
said O
, O
Oh O
, O
I O
guess O
you O
are O
not O
getting O
lucky O
tonight O
. O

The O
Food B-AS
The O
most O
dependable O
route O
is O
to O
stick O
to O
appetizers B-AS
- O
- O
the O
cheese B-AS
bread I-AS
is O
quite O
good O
- O
- O
and O
drinks O
. O

During O
my O
meal B-AS
the O
waiter B-AS
and O
waitress O
gathered O
with O
other O
friends O
that O
had O
arrived O
and O
they O
spent O
the O
whole O
time O
talking O
and O
ignoring O
the O
clientele O
. O

This O
is O
a O
don O
' O
t O
miss O
if O
you O
are O
anywhere O
close O
to O
the O
area O
, O
but O
if O
you O
' O
re O
going O
for O
lunch B-AS
, O
be O
there O
by O
noon O
to O
avoid O
a O
wait B-AS
. O

Mostly O
, O
this O
small O
restaurant O
offers O
eggs B-AS
, O
hot B-AS
sandwiches I-AS
and O
traditional O
American B-AS
platters I-AS
. O

When O
we O
went O
up O
to O
get O
what O
we O
assumed O
would O
be O
our O
second O
drink B-AS
at O
no O
charge O
, O
the O
bartender B-AS
charged O
us O
$ O
5 O
a O
piece O
. O

I O
had O
perhaps O
the O
finest B-AS
buffalo I-AS
mozerella I-AS
and I-AS
tomato I-AS
salad I-AS
- O
the O
cheese B-AS
seemed O
to O
melt O
in O
my O
mouth O
, O
and O
the O
tomatos O
were O
red O
, O
ripe O
and O
sweet O
. O

the O
solitary B-AS
waitress I-AS
was O
friendly O
though O
i O
found O
her O
service B-AS
a O
little O
slow O
. O

I O
thought O
it O
was O
great O
, O
best O
service B-AS
I O
' O
ve O
ever O
had O
in O
a O
long O
time B-AS
. O

This O
is O
authentic O
Japanese B-AS
food I-AS
- O
California O
roll O
is O
not O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
. O

The O
salads B-AS
were O
like O
those O
we O
were O
served O
in O
Paris O
, O
and O
the O
Eggs B-AS
Benedict I-AS
were O
out O
of O
this O
world O
. O

The O
menu B-AS
is O
limited O
: O
chicken B-AS
, O
rice B-AS
beans I-AS
, O
frozen O
fish O
( O
shrimp O
, O
whiting B-AS
, O
crab B-AS
sticks I-AS
) O
, O
and O
french B-AS
fries I-AS
, O
but O
one O
receives O
EXCELLENT O
value B-AS
for O
the B-AS
money I-AS
and O
it O
is O
SO O
WORTH O
walking O
down O
the O
block O
for O
. O

We O
got O
the O
cold O
appetizer O
sampler O
and O
the O
dish B-AS
was O
FULL O

all O

working O
the O

( O
red O

) O
- O
very O
funny O
and O

The O
waitress B-AS
did O
try O
to O
get O
the O
manager O
to O
at O
least O
give O
us O
the O
Sangria B-AS
on O
the O
house O
but O
the O

refused O

Well O
, O
what O
can O
I O
say O
about O
a O
restaurant O
with O
a O
takeaway O
menu O
completely O
devoid O
of O
sugar B-AS
, O
butter B-AS
, O
or O
deep O

anything O
? O

One O
example O
: O
They O
literally O
took O
bread O
from O
my O
baby O
, O
after O
we O
ordered O
a O
brick O
oven O
pizza B-AS
, O
not O

When O
our O

came O
to O

we O
were O
told O
that O

and O
we O
could O

Not O
the O

but O
generous O
portions B-AS
( O
at O
least O
, O
on O
the O

) O
that O
were O
faultlessly O
executed O
, O
complemented O
by O
a O
varied O

list I-AS
ranging O
from O
that O

a O

What O
I O
can O
say O
is O
that O
it O
was O
definitely O
some O
very O
good O
quality B-AS
pizza B-AS
, O
no O
matter O
what O
area O
of O
the O
world O
/ O
style O
of O

you O
are O
used O
to O
. O

However O
, O
the O
service B-AS
was O
so O
excellent O
, O
we O
added O
$ O
10 O
to O
the O
tip B-AS
! O

Portions B-AS
are O
fairly O
generous O
and O
the O
staff B-AS
brings O
out O
multiple O
little O
bites O
and O
treats O
throughout O
dinner B-AS
. O

The O
loud O
belly B-AS
dancer O
with O
her O
scarf O
dragging O
across O
my O
food B-AS
and O
table O
, O
almost O
knocked O
over O
my O
water O
glass B-AS
. O

they O
used O
to O
have O
grilled B-AS
panini I-AS
for O
under O
$ O
9 O
at O
lunch B-AS
which O
was O
great O
considering O
that O
its O
a O
sitdown O
restaurant O
with O
service O
, O
but O
i O
didnt O
see O
those O
options O
when O
i O
came O
here O
this O
week O
. O

We O
decided O
to O
share O
order O
of O
filet B-AS
mignon I-AS
for O
the B-AS
table I-AS
because O
there O
was O
just O
not O
enough O
food B-AS
. O

The O
Chicken B-AS
Tikka I-AS
is O
so O
moist O
, O
plump O
, O
seasoned O
so O
well O
and O
simply O
divine O
( O
you O
don O
' O
t O
need O
any O
extra O
sauces B-AS
to O
get O
this O
well O
marinated B-AS
chicken I-AS
down O
. O

Or O
better O
yet O
, O
if O
on O
a O
budget O
and O
want O
to O
do O
something O
romantic O
, O
stop O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
for O
a O
drink O
and O
enjoy O
the O
sunset B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
delicious O
but O
we O
were O
rushed O
through O
dinner B-AS
because O
they O
were O
closing O
soon O
( O
since O
we O
were O
seated O
an O
hour O
later O
than O
we O
should O
have O
) O
. O

Comfort B-AS

the O
restaurant O
' O

the O

tasty O
and O
the O

are O

true O

Although O
we O
were O
seated O
quickly O
, O
ambiance B-AS
was O
cozy O
, O
service B-AS
was O
decent O
the O
overall O

We O

check O
for O
the O

and O
the O

became O
completely O

In O

cases O

it O

After O
the O

gave O
us O
our O

he O
never O

We O

up O

notified O
the O
hostess B-AS
that O
we O
were O
there O

the O
other O

were O
running O
a O

Get O
some O

This O

if O

t O

paying O
up O
) O
in O
a O
low O

with O

, O
but O
don O
' O
t O
mind O
putting O
up O
with O
sub O
- O
par O
level O
of O
service B-AS
. O

I O
went O
there O
with O
family O
and O
even O
though O
we O
had O
reservations B-AS
, O
we O
were O
seated O
30 O
minutes O
late O
, O
the O
food B-AS
took O
45 O
minutes O
to O
arrive O
and O
when O
I O
got O
the O
wrong O
order O
, O
I O
had O
a O
hard O
time O
trying O
to O
find O
the O
server B-AS
. O

our O
waiter B-AS
spilled O
an O
entire O
glass B-AS
of I-AS
water I-AS
on O
my O
brother O
and O
didn O
' O
t O
so O
much O
as O
acknowledge O
it O
, O
let O
alone O
apologize O
. O

we O
walked O
in O
to O
the O
resturant O
, O
squeezed O
by O
our O
( O
to O
be O
) O
waiter B-AS
( O
who O
ignored O
us O
and O
didnt O
step O
to O
the O
side O
) O
, O
and O
straight O
up O
to O
the O
host B-AS
( O
he O
was O
busy O
talking O
to O
the O
bar B-AS
tender O
) O
. O

Unlike O
the O
reviewer O
before O
me O
, O
what O
made O
me O
KEEP O
going O
back O
was O
the O
great O
reception O
I O
received O
from O
the O
bouncers O
and O
I O
needed O
several O
cocktails B-AS
to O
endure O
the O
waitstaff B-AS
. O

If O
you O
' O
re O
going O
with O
a O
date O
to O
a O
lounge B-AS
on O
that O
street O
, O
stop O
there O
for O
a O
drink B-AS
and O
a O
quick O
appetizer B-AS
first O
. O

The O
sexy O
waiter B-AS
suggested O
the O
Pineapple B-AS
Basil I-AS
( O
I O
Know O
is O
sounds O
yucky O
, O
but O
MMMM O
) O
Martini B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
good O
but O
it O
will O
not O
make O
up O
for O
the O
negligent O
, O
rude O
, O
condescending O
and O
hostile O
service B-AS
with O
the O
full O
support O
of O
their O
management O
we O
received O
. O

I O
guess O
if O
you O
order O
the O
chef B-AS
' O
s O
tasting O
menu B-AS
, O
which O
is O
a O
seven O
course O
meal O
with O
an O
optional O
wine O
matching O
for O
$ O
125pp O
then O
your O
tummy O
will O
be O
well O
satisfied O
. O

When O
we O
requested O
a O
table O
our O
bar O
tab O
was O
quickly O
transferred O
and O
the O
LOVELY O
hostess B-AS
sat O
us O
at O
a O
table O
of O
our O
choice O
- O
we O
chose O
the O
corner B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
good O
, O
and O
we O
won O
' O
t O
let O
one O
bad O
apple B-AS
spoil O
the O
batch O
. O

Went O
on O
a O
Saturday O
with O
out O
of O
town O
tickets O
and O
the O
food B-AS
was O
great O
but O
the O
service B-AS
was O
awful O
, O
even O
surely O
. O

we O
shared O
many O
dishes B-AS
but O
none O
really O
stood O
out O
except O
the O
spinach B-AS
, O
wow O
! O
! O

Few O
styles O
of O
cooking O
place O
such O
an O
importance O
on O
texture B-AS
- O
- O
baby O
eels O
in O
a O
sizzling O
slick O
of O
oil B-AS
, O
for O
example O
, O
is O
nudged O
just O
a O
shade O
away O
from O
pasta B-AS
by O
the O
crackle O
of O
tiny O
bones O
under O
your O
teeth O
. O

Encouraged O
, O
I O
went O
back O
for O
dinner B-AS
and O
was O
again O
impressed O
: O
crisp O
, O
spicy O
asparagus B-AS
spears I-AS
( O
tad O
too O
spicy O
? O

While O
you O
' O
re O
standing O
around O
for O
a O
good O
half O
hour B-AS
waiting I-AS
for O
two O
plain O
burgers B-AS
, O
you O
' O
re O
being O
bumped O
into O
by O
people O
waiting O
to O
be O
seated O
because O
of O
the O
narrow O
passageway O
leading O
to O
the O
dining O
area B-AS
. O

Sushi B-AS
pieces O
are O
smaller O
if O
u O
r O
a O
' O
buffet O
' O
customer O
and O
choices B-AS
are O
rather O
limited O
and O
there O
' O
s O
really O
nothing O
special O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
. O

Our O
waitress B-AS
was O
pleasant O
but O
slow O
, O
and O
the O
food B-AS
is O
simply O
not O
good O
enough O
to O
be O
treated O
like O
a O
nuisance O
. O

The O
head O
waiter B-AS
made O
some O
lame O
excuse O
about O
how O
the O
chef O
had O
asked O
the O
hostess B-AS
to O
revise O
the O
menu B-AS
but O
it O
had O
not O
been O
changed O
. O

Later O
in O
the O
evening O
after O
our O
meal B-AS
we O
finally O
found O
the O
real O
owner B-AS
behind O
the O
bar B-AS
of O
the O
restaurant O
and O
explained O
to O
him O
the O
situation O
which O
he O
had O
been O
made O
aware O
of O
by O
the O
waitress B-AS
. O

The O
only O
concern O
i O
have O
is O
with O
the O
slighly O
all O
- O
business O
waitstaff B-AS
who O
order O
and O
throw O
the O
food B-AS
down O
, O
rushing O
you O
out O
. O

The O
price B-AS
wouldnt O
be O
so O
bad O
if O
it O
wasnt O
for O
the O
poor O
service B-AS
, O
average O
food O
, O
and O
uninspired O
menu B-AS
selections I-AS
( O
choice O
of O
tiramisu B-AS
and O
strawberries O
with O
whipped O
cream B-AS
for O
dessert B-AS
? O
! O

If O
you O
' O
re O
not O
looking O
for O
a O
pretentious O
atmosphere B-AS
and O
a O
restaurant B-AS
that O
serves O
the O
best O
steak B-AS
you O
' O
ve O
ever O
eaten O
. O

The O
food B-AS
* O
was O
* O
pretty O
good O
, O
though O
, O
( O
though O
certainly O
not O
worth O
the O
prices B-AS
) O
so O
it O
' O
s O
worth O
checking O
out O
if O
you O
have O
an O
expense O
account O
to O
work O
with O
. O

Our O
waiter B-AS
was O
great O
and O
we O
even O
got O
drinks O
and O
some O
food B-AS
courtesy O
of O
the O
cheff O
- O
maybe O
because O
it O
wasn O
' O
t O
so O
busy O
when O
we O
went O
. O

* O
Food O
: O
Just O
about O
anything O
on O
the O

however O
the O

And O
when O
I O
received O
my O
$ O
9 O
glass B-AS
of I-AS

, O
I O
had O
to O
ask O
the O
waitress B-AS
if O
she O
planned O
on O
putting O
more O
in O
- O
- O
there O
was O
hardly O
any O
liquid O
in O
the O
glass O
! O

Any O
sandwich B-AS
or O
appetizer O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
is O
delicious O
. O

The O
hamburger O
showed O
up O
long O
before O
the O
mussels B-AS
, O
and O
the O
waiter B-AS
suggested O
I O
start O
eating O
because O
he O
didnt O
want O
my O
food B-AS
to O
get O
cold O
. O

Try O
the O

offended O
when O

When O
we O
sat O
down O

the O
waiter B-AS
barely O
looked O
in O
our O
direction O
and O
abruptly O
shoved O
our O

the O

My O

The O

we O
only O
received O
2 O
small O
scoops O
of O
commercial B-AS
ice I-AS
cream I-AS
- O
- O
no O
pastries O
. O

My O
nice O
waitress B-AS
even O
came O
running O
out O
of O
the O
restaurant O
to O
hand O
me O
a O
tiny O
box O
I O
had O
forgotten O
on O
the O
table B-AS
. O

Bland O
food B-AS
, O
arroganrt O
waiters B-AS
. O

The O
cajun B-AS
food I-AS
is O
great O
but O
there O
is O
something O
for O
everyone O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
and O
I O
have O
yet O
to O
be O
disappointed O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
of O
the O
place B-AS
is O
nice O
as O
well O
as O
the O
location O
, O
but O
I O
found O
food B-AS
mediocre O
and O
too O
expensive O
for O
the O
quality O
offered O
. O

The O
Food B-AS
The O
French O
- O
Belgian O
menu O
is O
small O
, O
and O
everything O
on O
it O
is O
satisfyingly O
savory O
, O
such O
as O
a O
simple O
pot B-AS
of O
mussels B-AS
in O
a O
choice B-AS
of I-AS
sauces I-AS
( O
beer O
and O
bacon O
, O
creamy O
mushroom O
, O
or O
white B-AS
wine I-AS
- I-AS
and I-AS
- I-AS
garlic I-AS
broth I-AS
) O
; O
beef B-AS
stewed I-AS
with I-AS
beer I-AS
and O
prunes O
; O
and O
a O
juicy O
croque O
monsieur O
. O

Not O
only O
is O
it O
the O
nicest O
atmosphere B-AS
with O
an O
antique O
bar B-AS
and O
allabaster O
globes O
sconces O
, O
marble O
fireplace O
. O

We O
reserved O
the O
downstair B-AS
lounge I-AS
for O
private O
parties O
and O
the O
price B-AS
was O
fairly O
reasonable O
. O

after O
such O
a O
strong O
showing O
, O
dessert B-AS
was O
a O
letdown O
per O
our O
waiters B-AS
recommendation O
, O
we O
ordered O
the O
raspberry O
softie O
the O
coconut O
- O
stuffed O
apricots O
the O
softie O
tasted O
like O
a O
mixture O
between O
cough O
syrup O
a O
starburst O
, O
whereas O
the O
apricots O
were O
extremely O
sour O
. O

great O
food B-AS
, O
but O
not O
low O
fat B-AS
. O

When O
asked O
what O
the O
waitress B-AS
recommended O
she O
just O
named O
a O
few O
things O
off O
the O
menu B-AS
without O
saying O
why O
. O

The O
spicy B-AS
tuna I-AS
is O
great O
, O
as O
is O
the O
seasonal O
spider B-AS
roll I-AS
, O
( O
soft B-AS
shell I-AS
crab I-AS
) O
. O

The O
waitstaff O
briskly O
plunks O
down O
dishes B-AS
that O
take O
alarmingly O
little O
time O
to O
make O
, O
which O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
dumplings O
, O
include O
sizzling O
platters O
of O
meat B-AS
and O
lo O
mein B-AS
noodles I-AS
. O

The O
place B-AS
is O
small O
and O
intimate O
and O
you O
may O
feel O
a O
little O
crowded O
, O
but O
the O
service B-AS
is O
excellent O
and O
it O
' O
s O
great O
for O
friends O
out O
, O
a O
romantic O
date O
, O
or O
a O
special O
occassion O
. O

Sometimes O
I O
wish O
there O
were O
a O
bar B-AS
to O
sit O
at O
and O
have O
a O
glass B-AS
of I-AS
wine I-AS
, O
but O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
the O
lack O
of O
one O
allows O
the O
place B-AS
a O
pleasant O
sit O
down O
sort O
of O
feel O
. O

I O
can O
' O
t O
imagine O
how O
small O
the O
fish B-AS
portion I-AS
on O
the O
$ O
10 O
lunch B-AS
menu I-AS
must O
be O
if O
I O
got O
the O
large O
one B-AS
. O

I O
just O
think O
the O
prices B-AS
are O
high O
for O
the O
type O
of O
food B-AS
the O
kitchen O
turns O
out O
as O
well O
as O
the O
portion B-AS
sizes I-AS
. O

This O
is O
a O
very O
small O
4 O
tables O
or O
so O
restaurant O
with O
a O
very O
modest O
enviornment O
, O
so O
if O
you O
' O
re O
with O
business O
partners O
for O
lunch B-AS
or O
dinner B-AS
, O
Plataforma O
Restaurant O
or O
Brazil O
Grill B-AS
are O
the O
better O
choices O
, O
but O
if O
you O
got O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
with O
some O
buddies O
of O
yours O
, O
then O
this O
one O
may O
be O
for O
you O
. O

You O
can O
go O
to O
all O
these O
gormet O
places O
and O
eat O
expensive O
pizza B-AS
this O
is O
the O
best O
cheese B-AS
, O
sauce B-AS
, O
bread B-AS
its O
a O
done O
deal O
. O

The O
waitress B-AS
asked O
us O
if O
we O
' O
d O
be O
eating O
dinner B-AS
. O

The O
owner B-AS
lied O
to O
me O
when O
i O
asked O
where O
our O
food B-AS
was O
1 O
hour O
after O
we O
placed O
the O
order O
- O
he O
said O
oh O
your O
friend O
said O
you O
were O
not O
ready O
for O
it O
. O

The O
service B-AS
is O
Ok O
, O
but O
they O
must O
have O
drank O
the O
coolade O
, O
as O
they O
believe O
that O
they O
are O
serving B-AS
good O
food B-AS
! O

No O
compensatory O
nibbles B-AS
or O
drinks B-AS
were O
supplied O
- O
- O
even O
after O
we O
indicated O
to O
the O
waiter B-AS
that O
it O
was O
' O
the O
right O
thing O
to O
do O
' O

My O
party O
got O
the O
dessert B-AS
sampler I-AS
which O
included O
6 O
highlights O
from O
the O
dessert B-AS
menu I-AS
- O
- O
each O
of O
which O
were O
worth O
the O
price O
of O
the B-AS
three I-AS
course I-AS
meal I-AS
( O
$ O
90 O
per O
person O
with O
margaritas B-AS
, O
tax O
, O
and O
tip O
) O
. O

The O
bartender B-AS
said O
that O
they O
didn O
' O
t O
have O
one O
, O
but O
did O
say O
, O
We O
have O
mixed O
drinks B-AS
. O

Great O
roofdeck B-AS
, O
nice O
group O
of O
30 O
somethings O
, O
but O
no O
music B-AS
, O
kind O
of O
quiet O
. O

the O
place B-AS
is O
small O
but O
everything O
else O
is O
' O
big O
' O
in O
terms O
of O
quality B-AS
variety I-AS
and O
smiles O
of O
the O
wait O
service B-AS
. O

The O
coffee B-AS
by O
the O
name O
of O
the O
place O
is O
delicious O
and O
although O
the O
space B-AS
is O
a O
bit O
tight O
, O
it O
' O
s O
a O
great O
place O
to O
chat O
, O
chill O
or O
simply O
enjoy O
a O
great O
cup B-AS
of O
joe B-AS
. O

I O
requested O
a O
Riesling O
and O
the O
waiter B-AS
recommended O
staying O
with O
the O
Sencere O
which O
didn O
' O
t O
come O
by O
the O
glass B-AS
according O
to O
the O
menu B-AS
but O
he O
provided O
it O
to O
us O
any O
ways O
. O

Pad O
thai O
and O
a O
variety O
of O
noodle O
soups O
, O
such O
as O
pho O
bac O
and O
Bangkok O
Curry O
, O
round O
out O
the O
menu B-AS
and O
arrive O
in O
heaping O
portions B-AS
. O

The O
mussles O
had O
be O
be O
a O
portion B-AS
of O
maybe O
8 O
- O
9 O
mussles O
only O
and O
the O
gnocci B-AS
were O
basically O
all O
garlic O
- O
garlic O
is O
just O
meant O
to O
be O
a O
condiment O
- O
way O
tooo O
much O
garlic O
. O

When O
the O
waitress B-AS
brought O
the O
check O
after O
an O
hour O
, O
she O
finally O
noticed O
that O
I O
had O
been O
sitting O
without O
food B-AS
and O
offered O
to O
get O
it O
for O
me O
. O

I O
don O
' O
t O
understand O
the O
other O
negative O
reviews O
of O
the O
service B-AS
because O
we O
had O
amazing O
waiter B-AS
. O

Al O
Di O
La O
serves O
up O
an O
impressive O
selection O
of O
options B-AS
ranging O
from O
meditarranean O
fish B-AS
to O
rabbit O
to O
to O
duck O
to O
pasta B-AS
. O

Many O
Thais O
top O
off O
spicy O
dishes B-AS
with O
a B-AS
fried I-AS
egg I-AS
, O
but O
in O
many O
places O
it O
' O
s O
not O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
and O
when O
requested O
, O
I O
will O
either O

At O

. O

We O
were O
given O
only O
one O
waiter B-AS
for O
20 O
people O
, O
and O
it O
honestly O
took O
over O
1 O
/ O
2 O
an O
hour O
to O
get O
coffee B-AS
( O
I O
actully O
went O
across O
the O
street O
to O
Dunkin O
Donuts O
! O
) O

My O
dining B-AS
experience O
with O
friends O
started O
off O
very O
badly O
- O
40 O
minute O
wait B-AS
WITH O
a O
reservation B-AS
and O
having O
to O
repeatedly O
ask O
for O
bread O
and O
water B-AS
- O
but O
ended O
on O
a O
better O
note O
. O

While O
the O
restaurant O
/ O
space O
itself O
isn O
' O
t O
so O
great O
( O
somewhat O
cramped O
cheesy O
interior B-AS
, O
and O
the O
name O
implies O
its O
a O
burrito B-AS
take I-AS
- I-AS
out I-AS
place I-AS
) O
, O
the O
service B-AS
and O
food B-AS
outway O
its O
few O
cons O
. O

The O
uptight O
female O
manager B-AS
came O
up O
to O
our O
table O
and O
rudely O
asked O
us O
to O
get O
up O
because O
they O
had O
a O
party O
waiting B-AS
to O
eat O
. O

This O
is O
definitely O
not O
a O
place O
to O
come O
for O
lunch B-AS
because O
you O
can O
get O
the O
same O
food O
from O
a O
corner O
deli O
at O
half O
the O
price B-AS
they O
charge O
here O
. O

Fortunately O
the O
hostess B-AS
was O
nice O
enough O
to O
take O
our O
appetizers B-AS
off O
the O
bill O
after O
we O
complained O
. O

The O
service B-AS
is O
smart O
and O
though O
they O
can O
be O
overwhelmed O
with O
the O
crowds B-AS
, O
does O
a O
good O
job O
. O

Appetizers B-AS
took O
their O
sweet O
time B-AS
in O
coming O
, O
and O
literally O
about O
an O
hour O
later O
we O
had O
our O
main B-AS
dishes I-AS
which O
were O
very O
small O
considering O
the O
price B-AS
. O

The O
food O
had O
a O
somewhat O
elevated O
price B-AS
tag O
but O
but O
fair O
considering O
the O
Nobu O
origin O
- O
The O
cocktails B-AS
highly O
recommended O
including O
the O
spide B-AS
and O
lobster B-AS
roll I-AS
- O
we O
were O
well O
plated O
and O
did O
not O
encounter O
any O
arragance O
from O
the O
staff B-AS
- O
maybe O
the O
other O
student O
reviewers O
are O
used O
to O
cafeteria O
service B-AS
. O

I O
would O
not O
suggest O
dining B-AS
here O
unless O
you O
get O
a O
different O
server B-AS
. O

For O
lunch B-AS
, O
try O
the O
white B-AS
meat I-AS
chicken I-AS
salad I-AS
. O

They O
don O
' O
t O
offer O
recommendations O
, O
take O
a O
long O
time O
with O
drink O
orders O
, O
don O
' O
t O
check O
back O
after O
serving B-AS
the O
entree B-AS
, O
and O
plan O
on O
waiting B-AS
a O
long O
time O
for O
the O
check O
. O

One O
waiter B-AS
came O
by O
and O
literally O
threw O
the O
$ O
36 O
salad B-AS
on O
the O
table B-AS
. O

We O
had O
to O
call O
him O
over O
3 O
times O
during O
the O
meal B-AS
because O
he O
gave O
us O
the O
wrong O
food B-AS
, O
did O
not O
bring O
water O
after O
we O
asked O
twice O
, O
gave O
me O
the O
wrong O
drink B-AS
, O
and O
did O
not O
check O
on O
us O
once O
. O

The O
owner B-AS
kindly O
gave O
us O
appetizers B-AS
on O
the O
house O
to O
make O
our O
now O
, O
long O
wait O
, O
more O
pleasant O
, O
but O
of O
course O
they O
took O
forever O
to O
arrive O
and O
were O
insufficient O
. O

I O
adore O
Zen B-AS
Palate O
- O
and O
both O
the O
formal B-AS
upstairs I-AS
dining I-AS
room I-AS
and O
the O
crowded O
, O
counter O
- O
style O
cafe O
downstair O
, O
have O
their O
pros O
and O
cons O
. O

After O
spending O
over O
$ O
500 O
on O
a O
business O
dinner B-AS
, O
a O
manager B-AS
knelt O
down O
at O
our O
table B-AS
and O
asked O
us O
to O
quote O
, O
wrap O
it O
up O
and O
move O
to O
the O
bar B-AS
. O

To O
SM O
' O
s O
credit O
, O
our O
waiter B-AS
was O
eventually O
replaced O
and O
the O
matre O
d O
' O
offered O
us O
free O
dessert B-AS
, O
but O
we O
' O
re O
not O
going O
back O
there O
ever O
again O
. O

The O
entrance O
is O
a O
bit O
unwelcoming O
, O
after O
you O
pass O
throught O
the O
glass B-AS
doors I-AS
you O
enter O
a O
cedar O
rich O
hallway O
and O
the O
woods B-AS
at O
the O
entrance O
and O
downstairs O
are O
rich O
, O
but O
to O
my O
horror O
the O
main O
dining O
room O
is O
wallpapered O
in O
faux O
wood O
veneer O
making O
it O
look O
like O
a O
bad O
episode O
of O
trading O
spaces O
. O

It O
' O
s O
a O
shame O
you O
can O
' O
t O
even O
sample O
the O
food B-AS
or O
sit O
in O
what O
is O
a O
very O
nice O
space B-AS
. O

also O
, O
when O
i O
was O
waiting O
to O
be O
seated O
the O
bartender B-AS
gave O
great O
service B-AS
and O
mixed O
a O
mean O
cocktail B-AS
for O
me O
. O

It O
gets O
crazy O
busy O
like O
any O
other O
bar B-AS
on O
the O
weekends O
, O
so O
don O
' O
t O
go O
there O
on O
a O
busy O
night O
if O
your O
looking O
for O
a O
quiete O
dinner O
party O
or O
fine O
dining O
service B-AS
. O

A O
friend O
was O
dieing O
for O
chorizo B-AS
but O
it O
was O
only O
in O
the O
tapas B-AS
menu I-AS
which O
we O
couldn O
' O
t O
have O
. O

This O
is O
the O
local O
spot O
where O
we O
can O
always O
count O
on O
for O
a O
great O
brunch O
, O
a O
California O
Burger O
, O
the O
best O
fries O
or O
their O
carrot B-AS
dressing I-AS
for O
salads B-AS
. O

This O
place O
is O
good O
but O
food B-AS
and O
service O
is O
presented O
for O
the O
masses O
, O
not O
much O
personalized O
service O
considering O
the O
price O
tag O
and O
that O
it O
is O
a O
full O
- O
evening O
- O
out O
type O
of O
dinner B-AS
place I-AS
. O

While O
it O
can O
get O
pricey O
, O
25 O
$ O
for O
a O
lobster B-AS
3sides O
and O
a O
refillable B-AS
drink I-AS
, O
its O
tons O
of O
fun O
, O
and O
the O
food B-AS
tastes O
great O
! O

The O
waiter B-AS
said O
they O
mixed O
it O
up O
because O
there O
were O
three O
similar O
things O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
. O

Dinner O
' O
s O
nothing O
to O
scream O
about O
( O
although O
there O
are O
a O
few O
winners O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
) O
, O
but O
solid O
margaritas B-AS
and I-AS
appetizers I-AS
are O
well O
- O
suited O
for O
a O
summer O
evening O
. O

Mysteriously O
, O
the O
reserved B-AS
tables I-AS
all O
stayed O
empty O
throughout O
our O
meal B-AS
and O
were O
still O
empty O
when O
we O
left O
an O
hour O
later O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
I O
never O
felt O
rushed O
to O
vacate O
the O
place B-AS
at O
the O
end O
of O
my O
meal B-AS
. O

The O

I O
asked O
one O
of O
the O
more O
elderly O
managers B-AS
what O
we O
were O
eating O
and O
he O

that O
he O
didn O
' O

really O
know O
so O
he O
referred O
someone O
else O
to O
us O
who O
basically O
repeated O
what O
was O
written O
in O
the O
menu B-AS

BUT O
most O

are O
GREAT O
as O
the O

how O
our O

doing O
. O

Had O
a O
few O
appetizers B-AS
; O
smoked O
duck O
was O
served O
cold O
but O
good O
flavor B-AS
, O
tofu O
was O
good O
/ O
fresh O
too O
, O
nothing O
to O
rave O
about O
though O
. O

We O
had O
to O
ask O
the O
busboy B-AS
if O
bread O
came O
with O
our O
meal B-AS
, O
which O
it O
did O
and O
we O
received O

waiting B-AS
about O
30 O
minutes O

The O
Food B-AS
The O
free O
chips O
- O
and O
- O
salsa O
may O
suggest O
casual O
Tex O
- O
Mex O
cooking O
, O
but O
this O
menu B-AS
is O
a O
couple O
notches O
above O
. O

The O
menu B-AS
holds O
no O
letdowns O
: O
Desserts B-AS
, O
like O
a O
cone O
of O
stiff O
kulfi O
with O
licorice O
, O
ot O
cinnamon O
souffle B-AS
, O
extend O
dinner B-AS
' O
s O
spice O
into O
the O
sweet O
realm O
. O

The O
place O
was O
a O
bit O
noisy O
, O
but O
sitting O
on O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
restaurant O
helped O
, O
and O
although O
the O
portions B-AS
were O
small O
, O
w O
/ O
an O
appetizer O
it O
was O
the O
perfect O
amount O
of O
food B-AS
. O

Id O
say O
a O
little O
better O
than O
most O
Thai O
Ive O
eaten O
, O
and O
the O
menu B-AS
had O
an O
astounding O
selection B-AS
, O
which O
isnt O
bad O
for O
such O
a O
reasonable O
price B-AS
. O

Nonetheless O
, O
it O
' O
s O
an O
excellent O
pie B-AS
- O
- O
and O
don O
' O
t O
let O
the O
long O
lines B-AS
scare O
you O
off O
- O
- O
they O
keep O
them O
moving O
. O

This O
place O
is O
the O
tourist O
fav O
of O
chinese B-AS
food I-AS
in O
the O
city O
, O
the O
service O
was O
fast O
, O
but O
the O
taste O
of O
the B-AS
food I-AS
is O
average O
, O
too O
much O
starch O
used O
in O
dishes O
, O
and O
the O
flavors B-AS
of I-AS
different I-AS
dishes I-AS
are O
very O
similar O
, O
can O
' O
t O
really O
tell O
the O
difference O
. O

The O
owner B-AS
himself O
one O
time O
came O
to O
our O
table O
to O
clear O
our O
dishes B-AS
when O
our O
waiter B-AS
didn O
' O
t O
show O
( O
a O
rare O
occurance O
, O
but O
it O
was O
late O
at O
night O
) O
. O

they O
continue O
to O
expand O
their O
garden B-AS
space I-AS
, O
w O
/ O
out O
expanding O
their O
kitchen B-AS
and O
cannot O
provide O
even O
adequate O
service B-AS
. O

We O
were O
seated O
fastly O
enough O
, O
and O
ordering B-AS
was O
painless O
, O
but O
I O
got O
the O
wrong O
appetizer B-AS
, O
we O
both O
received O
the O
same O
item O
instead O
. O

Choices B-AS
are O
standard O
and O
plentiful O
: O
omelettes O
and O
egg B-AS
dishes I-AS
, O
pancakes B-AS
, O
bagels O
, O
muffins B-AS
, O
croissants O
, O
mini O
- O
doughnuts O
, O
cookies O
, O
etc O
. O

Waiters B-AS
had O
to O
reach O
over O
people O
to O
deliver O
food B-AS
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
horrible O
- O
the O
' O
manager O
' O
took O
my O
our O
order O
- O
did O
not O
write O
it O
down O
- O
and O
two O
of O
us O
were O
given O
the O
wrong O
apps O
and O
or O
entrees B-AS
. O

Even O
if O
their O
service B-AS
was O
not O
top O
notch O
at O
all O
times O
, O
at O
least O
the O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
was O
very O
accommodating O
and O
respectful O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
very O
rushed O
and O
as O
we O
were O
finishing O
our O
drinks B-AS
and O
paying O
our O
bill O
, O
the O
owner B-AS
asked O
us O
to O
leave O
so O
he O
could O
seat O
other O
people O
at O
our O
table O
. O

however O
the O
dessert B-AS
porportions O
somehow O
ballooned O
to O
regular O
conventional O
sizes B-AS
. O

Summary O
good O
service B-AS
, O
bad O
food B-AS
! O

It O
was O
spaced O
out O
( O
we O
had O
the O
80pp O
) O
, O
toro B-AS
appetizer I-AS
was O
so O
smooth O
, O
we O
had O
quail B-AS
, O
numerous O
sushi B-AS
, O
soup B-AS
, O
pumpin B-AS
puree I-AS
and O
more O
. O

Not O
to O
mention O
that O
the O
busboy B-AS
spilled O
2 O
glasses B-AS
of I-AS
water I-AS
on O
my O
back O
and O
the O
Manager B-AS
was O
NOWHERE O
TO O
BE O
SEEN O
. O

I O
made O
reservations B-AS
one O
week O
in O
advance O
and O
although O
I O
had O
to O
change O
it O
at O
the O
last O
minute O
, O
the O
hostess B-AS
was O
very O
accommodating O
and O
we O
got O
seated O
promptly O
upstairs O
overlooking O
the O
Buddha O
. O

And O
once O
the O
bill B-AS
was O
paid O
, O
the O
bartender B-AS
kept O
on O
giving O
us O
drinks B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
came O
out O
really O
quick O
and O
the O
service B-AS
overall O
was O
not O
bad O
. O

Breakfast B-AS
, O
Lunch O
and O
Dinner O
are O
all O
great O
, O
but O
they O
are O
hit O
or O
miss O
with O
some O
of O
their O
pasta B-AS
dishes I-AS
. O

The O
Scene B-AS
The O
bar B-AS
' O
s O
upbeat B-AS
Latin I-AS
music I-AS
, O
colorful O
stools B-AS
and O
cocktail B-AS
napkins I-AS
, O
and O
a O
fruity B-AS
drink I-AS
menu I-AS
are O
the O
first O
confirmations O
that O
Agozar O
lives O
up O
to O
its O
translation O
: O
A O
good O
time O
. O

Though O
there O
are O
a O
handful O
of O
Japanese O
a O
la O
carte O
offerings O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
the O
prix B-AS
fixe I-AS
is O
most O
popular O
by O
far O
. O

For O
dinner B-AS
I O
had O
a O
very O
balanced O
spinach B-AS
fettucine I-AS
dish I-AS
served I-AS
piping I-AS
hot I-AS
with I-AS
salmon I-AS
, I-AS
dill I-AS
, O
in O
a O
creamy O
pink B-AS
sauce I-AS
. O

We O
often O
come O
with O
a O
baby B-AS
and O
the O
staff B-AS
is O
so O
sweet O
and O
kind O
to O
her O
, O
it O
is O
a O
joy O
to O
be O
there O
. O

Then O
, O
we O
discovered O
that O
not O
ordering O
guacamole B-AS
for O
your O
table O
is O
tantamount O
to O
asking O
the O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
to O
roll O
their O
eyes O
at O
you O
and O
then O
ignore O
you O
during O
your O
entire O
meal B-AS
( O
I O
had O
to O
eventually O
go O
to O
the O
front O
of O
the O
restaurant O
to O
ask O
for O
our O
check O
) O
. O

The O
calamari B-AS
salad I-AS
was O
huge O
( O
but O
delicious O
) O
- O
- O
it O
could O
be O
a O
meal B-AS
unto O
itself O
. O

The O
only O
drawback O
is O
that O
the O
tiny O
cafe O
can O
only O
hold O
so O
many O
people O
with O
even O
less O
tables B-AS
available O
, O
so O
if O
you O
are O
lucky O
enough O
to O
score O
a O
table O
, O
stay O
put O
with O
a O
date O
and O
some O
wine O
, O
because O
no O
place O
nearby O
can O
serve O
so O
much O
romance O
with O
such O
quality O
eats B-AS
. O

A O
hard O
- O
drinking O
, O
upscale O
crowd O
, O
holding O
conversations O
over O
loud O
Latin B-AS
jazz I-AS
music I-AS
, O
packs O
the O
small O
, O
open O
dining O
room O
and O
attached O
bar B-AS
. O

I O
wasn O
' O
t O
impressed O
by O
dessert B-AS
- O
I O
ordered O
truffles O
w B-AS
/ I-AS
bisquits I-AS
. O

I O
love O
it O
at O
lunch B-AS
time O
, O
less O
expensive O
, O
excellent O
food B-AS
, O
awesome O
people O
- O
watching O
( O
Hi O
, O
Regis O
who O
is O
right O
next O
to O
our O
table B-AS
) O
and O
really O
nice O
and O
airy O
in O
the O
summertime O
when O
they O
open O
the O
windows O
. O

A O
hint B-AS
of I-AS
wasabi I-AS
enlivens I-AS
the I-AS
shrimp I-AS
; O
while O
the O
vegetarian B-AS
, O
stuffed O
with O
seasonal O
greens O
, O
gets O
overwhelmed O
by O
its O
healthful O
- O
tasting O
herb B-AS
dipping I-AS
sauce I-AS
. O

had O
the O
$ O
80 O
chefs B-AS
tasting O
menu O
- O
was O
excellent O
- O
and O
we O
were O
stuffed O
- O
basically O
is O
a O
bit O
of O
all O
of O
their O
special B-AS
dishes I-AS
- O
one O
at O
a O
time O
- O
with O
sushi B-AS
soup I-AS
coming O
last O
. O

When O
I O
asked O
to O
speak O
to O
a O
manager B-AS
, O
I O
was O
sent O
to O
voicemail O
, O
and O
I O
still O
haven O
' O
t O
received O
a O
callback B-AS
. O

By O
dessert B-AS
, O
I O
gave O
up O
and O
sat O
there O
hopelessly O
watching O
as O
my O
rice B-AS
pudding I-AS
was O
snatched O
away O
half O
eaten O
, O
only O
to O
be O
replaced O
immediately O
with O
a O
hefty O
bill B-AS
. O

Don O
' O
t O
look O
for O
sushi B-AS
on O
the O
menu B-AS
although O
there O
' O
s O
tons O
of O
sake O
and O
it O
' O
s O
served B-AS
properly O
. O

Didn O
' O
t O
get O
a O
call O
so O
I O
thought O
all O
was O
ok O
- O
they O
didn O
' O
t O
have O
a O
reservation B-AS
and O
wouldn O
' O
t O
seat O
us O
for O
over O
an O
hour O
even O
though O
no O
one O
else O
was O
waiting O
and O
I O
saw O
several O
empty O
tables B-AS
. O

On O
top O
of O
that O
, O
the O
portions B-AS
were O
hearty O
enough O
that O
we O
barely O
had O
any O
appetite O
left O
for O
dessert B-AS
. O

When O
I O
pointed O
this O
out O
to O
the O
waiter B-AS
he O
told O
me O
that O
all O
of O
the O
lox B-AS
is O
like O
that O
. O

But O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
a O
great O
experience O
doesn O
' O
t O
just O
pertain O
to O
food O
, O
and O
an O
evening O
of O
dining B-AS
is O
certainly O
given O
a O
bad O
taste O
when O
the O
service B-AS
is O
not O
up O
to O
par O
. O

There O
was O
a O
ten O
minute O
wait B-AS
with O
a O
reservation B-AS
, O
but O
the O
bar B-AS
kept O
us O
entertained O
. O

We O
were O
about O
the O
leave O
when O
a O
nice O
waitress B-AS
explained O
to O
us O
that O
she O
' O
d O
personally O
seat O
us O
when O
she O
witnessed O
the O
hostess B-AS
' O
actions O
. O

The O
food B-AS
wasn O
' O
t O
impressive O
either O
- O
I O
was O
expecting O
huge O
portions B-AS
, O
but O
my O
lobster B-AS
ravioli I-AS
was O
only O
4 O
medium O
sized O
pieces O
, O
and O
I O
' O
ve O
tasted O
better O
at O
other O
restaurants O
. O

Even O
when O
the O
chef B-AS
is O
not O
in O
the O
house O
, O
the O
food B-AS
and O
service B-AS
are O
right O
on O
target O
. O

Be O
prepared O
to O
wait O
for O
your O
table B-AS
at O
peak O
hours O
, O
even O
if O
you O
have O
a O
reservation B-AS
. O

I O
used O
to O
think O
Lombardi O
' O
s O
served O
the O
best O
pizza B-AS
in O
the O
city O
, O
but O
then O
I O
happened O
in O
on O
Grimaldi O
' O
s O
en O
route O
to O
the O
Brooklyn O
Ice O
Cream B-AS
Factory O
one O
day O
. O

We O
ordered O
Brushetta B-AS
, O
a O
6 O
on O
a O
scale O
of O
10 O
, O
I O
like O
cold B-AS
tomatoes I-AS
on I-AS
toasted I-AS
bread I-AS
, O
they O
had O
warm O
tomatoes O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
ok O
, O
but O
not O
worth O
the O
prices B-AS
. O

If O
you O
' O
ve O
got O
the O
money O
and O
don O
' O
t O
mind O
being O
packed O
in O
like O
sardines B-AS
- O
then O
cozy O
on O
up O
to O
the O
Sushi O
Bar O
( O
much O
better O
than O
a O
table B-AS
) O
and O
let O
Gari O
work O
his O
Omikase O
magic O
. O

I O
had O
the O
GREATEST O
MEAL B-AS
THAT O
I O
' O
VE O
EVER O
HAD O
at O
Babbo O
( O
Aside O
from O
my O
Grandmothers O
) O
The O
food B-AS
is O
not O
quite O
traditional O
Italian O
but O
then O
again O
not O
exactly O
Nouvo O
- O
cuisine O
. O

The O
Food B-AS
For O
the O
most O
part O
, O
it O
' O
s O
solid O
, O
sometimes O
impressive O
Chinese O
: O
One O
can O
easily O
find O
better O
pork O
buns O
and O
Peking O
duck O
in O
Chinatown O
, O
but O
then O
you O
' O
d O
have O
to O
settle O
for O
dining B-AS
with O
regular O
folks O
. O

Not O
only O
is O
the O
sushi B-AS
mostly O
stellar O
, O
you O
' O
d O
have O
to O
be O
a O
real O
bonehead O
to O
not O
take O
advantage O
of O
their O
cooked O
items B-AS
. O

At O
one O
point O
, O
we O
tried O
to O
get O
our O
waitresses B-AS
attention O
and O
she O
ignored O
us O
and O
than O
we O
asked O
for O
more O
biscuits B-AS
and O
never O
got O
them O
. O

Yes O
, O
the O
wait B-AS
is O
long O
and O
ridiculous O
as O
times O
, O
especially O
as O
you O
watch O
others O
gobble O
down O
their O
food B-AS
. O

The O
staff B-AS
is O
warm O
and O
friendly O
, O
and O
the O
bartender B-AS
makes O
an O
awesome O
drink B-AS
with O
something O
called O
pisco O
. O

Save O
room O
for O
extra O
sides B-AS
, O
even O
though O
two O
come O
with O
each O
main O
course O
: O
The O
collard B-AS
greens I-AS
, O
gooey O
mac O
and O
cheese O
and O
ham B-AS
- I-AS
hocked I-AS
lima I-AS
beans I-AS
all O
stoke O
the O
soul O
like O
the O
sound O
of O
a O
pedal O
- O
steel O
guitar O
. O

It O
had O
not O
been O
made O
fresh O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
, O
but O
kept O
in O
the O
freezer O
till O
we O
ordered O
, O
they O
also O
forgot O
our O
soup B-AS
, O
kept O
us O
waiting B-AS
for O
the O
frozen B-AS
sushi I-AS
for O
close O
to O
an O
hour O
. O

There O
are O
some O
reviews O
complaining O
about O
the O
menu B-AS
but O
I O
had O
the O
same O
dish O
the O
first O
three O
times O
that O
I O
was O
there O
- O
and O
any O
specials B-AS
that O
I O
have O
had O
have O
been O
excellent O
. O

Everything O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
is O
worth O
trying O
at O
least O
once O
, O
from O
the O
calamari O
/ O
zucchini O
appetizer O
, O
to O
the O
homemade O
cavatelli O
, O
to O
the O
rib B-AS
eye I-AS
steak I-AS
( O
like O
butter O
! O
) O

It O
' O
s O
too O
loud O
and O
the O
cheesiest B-AS
music I-AS
is O
played O
throughout O
the O
meal B-AS
. O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
was O
embracing O
and O
enticing O
and O
the O
costs B-AS
of O
the O
meal O
, O
$ O
45 O
to O
$ O
55 O
in O
value O
. O

When O
we O
followed O
the O
waiter B-AS
to O
get O
back O
the O
card O
, O
the O
Manager B-AS
explained O
that O
their O
machine B-AS
did O
work O
, O
but O
someone O
else O
' O
s O
bill B-AS
was O
charged O
on O
our O
card O
( O
total O
charge O
= O
$ O
140 O
) O
. O

I O
have O
yet O
to O
visit O
for O
dinner B-AS
, O
but O
had O
a O
lovely O
brunch B-AS
there O
recently O
- O
the O
french B-AS
toast I-AS
is O
to O
DIE O
for O
. O

The O
Food B-AS
In O
addition O
to O
its O
potent O
, O
expertly O
made O
coffee B-AS
drinks I-AS
- O
- O
beans O
come O
from O
upstate O
coffee O
roaster O
Irving O
Farm O
- O
- O
71 O
stocks O
a O
full O
array B-AS
of I-AS
cakes I-AS
, O
tarts O
, O
sandwiches O
and O
salads B-AS
. O

The O
$ O
75 O
tasting O
menu B-AS
features O
seafood O
which O
is O
both O
unusual O
and O
powerfully O
fresh O
, O
but O
the O
chef B-AS
' I-AS
s I-AS
appetizers I-AS
which O
preceed O
it O
like O
sesame B-AS
flavored I-AS
tile I-AS
fish I-AS
with I-AS
raw I-AS
vegetable I-AS
salad I-AS
and O
japanese B-AS
spiced I-AS
flan I-AS
with I-AS
seafood I-AS
were O
unbalanced O
and O
far O
too O
delicate O
on O
the O
palate O
( O
although O
the O
tuna B-AS
tartare I-AS
with I-AS
avocado I-AS
is O
a O
standout O
) O
. O

I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
the O
food B-AS
at O
Bread B-AS
TriBeCa O
was O
a O
major O
letdown O
. O

There O
isn O
' O
t O
a O
huge O
selection O
of O
food B-AS
, O
but O
there O
' O
s O
something O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
for O
everyone O
to O
really O
enjoy O
. O

The O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
was O
all O
hanging O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
, O
lounging O
around O
. O

the O
manager B-AS
was O
nice O
profecional O
and O
service B-AS
was O
average O
but O
the O
food B-AS
was O
not O
italian O
, O
a O
diner B-AS
is O
better O
, O
try O
po O
' O

It O
took O
us O
20 O
minutes O
to O
get O
a O
check B-AS
, O
despite O
many O
attempts O
at O
meaningful O
eye O
contact O
with O
the O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
. O

Bread O
bar B-AS
couldn O
' O
t O
get O
anything O
right O
except O
water O
refills B-AS
( O
good O
job O
to O
the O
water O
guy O
) O
. O

Everyone O
says O
that O
their O
round O
slice B-AS
is O
no O
good O
, O
but O
the O
Sicilian B-AS
is O
so O
good O
that O
I O
have O
never O
tried O
the O
round O
. O

When O
we O
mentioned O
that O
we O
had O
theatre O
tickets O
, O
the O
waiter B-AS
made O
certain O
that O
our O
dishes B-AS
were O
served B-AS
promptly O
and O
courteously O
. O

When O
you O
feel O
like O
eating O
again O
an O
hour O
later O
( O
portions B-AS
are O
small O
) O
at O
least O
you O
won O
' O
t O
feel O
as O
regretful O
about O
ordering O
take B-AS
- I-AS
out I-AS
. O

The O
staff B-AS
were O
friendly O
, O
but O
the O
food B-AS
just O
wasn O
' O
t O
that O
great O
. O

For O
brunch B-AS
, O
go O
for O
the O
fluffy O
raisin B-AS
challah I-AS
French I-AS
toast I-AS
or O
Tex B-AS
- I-AS
Mex I-AS
scrambled I-AS
eggs I-AS
with O
fresh O
tortillas O
and O
a O
side O
of O
crisp B-AS
pork I-AS
sausage I-AS
. O

The O
pieces O
were O
small O
but O
the O
fish B-AS
was O
good O
quality B-AS
and O
there O
wasn O
' O
t O
a O
lot O
of O
rice B-AS
to O
mess O
with O
. O

The O
server B-AS
spilled O
beer B-AS
on O
the O
table B-AS
when O
he O
poured O
it O
; O
he O
dropped O
ice O
cubes O
for O
another O
one O
of O
our O
guests O
and O
water O
everywhere O
else O
. O

To O
start O
with O
- O
the O
maitre B-AS
' O
d O
forgot O
our O
reservation B-AS
and O
then O
when O
it O
came O
time O
to O
sit O
us O
down O
- O
he O
told O
us O
we O
only O
had O
an O
hour O
. O

This O
review O
is O
based O
on O
breakfast O
/ O
brunch O
: O
I O
called O
on O
Saturday O
for O
a O
table O
the O
next O
day O
( O
knowing O
it O
was O
unlikely O
that O
I O
' O
d O
get O
one O
) O
and O
the O
reservations B-AS
person O
told O
me O
that O
there O
were O
no O
tables B-AS
available O
. O

The O
staff B-AS
forgot O
my O
girlfriend O
' O
s O
food B-AS
altogether O
as O
she O
waited O
for O
half O
an O
hour O
. O

The O
silvery O
beige B-AS
decor I-AS
reflects O
the O
refined O
air B-AS
of O
the O
store O
as O
a O
whole O
. O

Our O
plates B-AS
were O
taken O
before O
we O
finished O
eating O
and O
our O
waitress B-AS
sent O
the O
hostess B-AS
to O
tell O
us O
we O
had O
to O
leave O
to O
make O
room O
for O
the O
next B-AS
table I-AS
and O
that O
we O
had O
to O
pay O
before O
we O
left O
. O

The O
restaurant O
is O
loud O
, O
the O
tables B-AS
are O
wooden O
and O
the O
service B-AS
is O
OK O
. O

Overall O
, O
it O
is O
a O
nice O
place O
and O
if O
you O
don O
' O
t O
mind O
possible O
attitude O
and O
the O
not O
- O
so O
- O
cheap O
prices B-AS
, O
it O
is O
a O
great O
place O
to O
meet O
for O
coffee B-AS
or O
drinks B-AS
( O
they O
have O
a O
nice O
selection O
of O
that O
too O
! O

had O
to O
ask O
the O
host B-AS
for O
the O
check B-AS
because O
the O
waitress B-AS
was O
sitting O
at O
another O
table O
taking O
their O
order O
. O

NOTE O
: O
Plan O
ahead O
, O
make O
a O
reservation B-AS
and O
arrive O
early O
- O
parking O
is O
tight O
in O
the O
area O
- O
valet O
service B-AS
is O
available O
if O
all O
else O
fails O
! O

Everything O
from O
the O
salmon B-AS
dip I-AS
at O
the O
bar B-AS
( O
while O
waiting O
for O
our O
table O
) O
to O
the O
dessert B-AS
was O
perfect O
. O

The O
front B-AS
desk I-AS
is O
disorganized O
( O
couldn O
' O
t O
find O
my O
reservation B-AS
made O
a O
week O
in O
advance O
) O
; O
service B-AS
is O
below O
- O
par O
; O
food O
is O
just O
so O
so O
; O
the O
most O
expected O
dessert O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
disappointed O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
as O
we O
were O
finishing O
up O
, O
the O
manager B-AS
hovered O
around O
us O
and O
asked O
us O
to O
go O
to O
the O
bar B-AS
to O
finish O
our O
drinks B-AS
because O
there O
were O
other O
people O
waiting B-AS
. O

The O
Food B-AS
Recalling O
an O
era O
of O
calorie O
- O
defying O
decadence O
- O
- O
hard O
liquor O
, O
red O
meat B-AS
, O
cigars O
and O
mammoth O
portions B-AS
- O
- O
gluttony O
is O
the O
operative O
word O
here O
. O

The O
Ceviche B-AS
was O
a O
standout O
, O
but O
everything O
was O
above O
average O
from O
the O
fried O
plantain O
and O
refried O
beans B-AS
to O
the O
homemade B-AS
guac I-AS
and O
yellow B-AS
rice I-AS
. O

The O
servers B-AS
were O
extremely O
professional O
, O
especially O
considering O
the O
entire O
room O
needed O
to O
be O
served B-AS
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

The O
food B-AS
, O
admittedly O
, O
was O
tasty O
( O
we O
came O
prepared O
for O
high O
prices O
and O
small O
portions O
) O
but O
I O
could O
not O
believe O
that O
with O
entrees B-AS
, O
appetizers B-AS
, O
and O
wine B-AS
that O
the O
servers O
would O
rush O
us O
through O
each O
course O
. O

The O
ambience B-AS
is O
simple O
, O
yet O
elegant O
and O
be O
sure O
to O
finish O
your O
meal B-AS
with O
their O
famous O
shlog O
. O

71 O
Irving B-AS
' O
s O
coffee B-AS
is O
not O
only O
delicious O
but O
also O
consistently O
delicious O
. O

The O
pommes B-AS
frites I-AS
are O
top O
- O
notch O
, O
and O
there O
' O
s O
an O
impressive O
array O
of O
Belgian B-AS
beers I-AS
to O
pair O
with O
your O
meal B-AS
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
was O
singing O
while O
taking O
our O
order O
- O
the O
food O
arrived O
30 O
minutes O
later O
and O
the O
food O
was O
good O
, O
but O
the O
mules B-AS
Frites I-AS
were O
cold O
, O
the O
steak O
had O
to O
be O
returned O
twice O
- O
the O
spinach B-AS
looked O
like O
it O
was O
grass O
from O
Union O
Square O
park O
with O
hunks O
of O
garlic B-AS
in O
it O
- O
totally O
Unacceptable O
. O

Half O
way O
through O
the O
meal O
we O
did O
not O
have O
refills O
on O
our O
waters O
, O
even O
though O
our O
waiter B-AS
passed O
the O
table B-AS
many O
times O
and O
he O
never O
stopped O
to O
check O
on O
us O
or O
to O
ask O
if O
we O
were O
pleased O
with O
the O
entrees O
. O

but O
when O
tables B-AS
began O
to O
clear O
up O
, O
it O
seemed O
polite O
to O
seat O
us O
comfortably O
in O
the O
dining O
area O
instead O
of O
having O
us O
twist O
our O
backs O
to O
talk O
, O
perched O
on O
bulky O
high O
chairs B-AS
at O
the O
bar B-AS
with O
no O
place O
to O
put O
our O
handbags O
( O
which O
the O
waiter B-AS
happened O
to O
drop O
and O
expose O
contents O
later O
on O
) O
. O

Most O
laughable O
moment O
of O
night O
was O
when O
waiter B-AS
offered O
me O
a O
free O
drink B-AS
to O
make O
up O
for O
th O
50 O
minute O
appetizer O
wait O
. O

cool O
new B-AS
cocktails I-AS
, O
amazing O
apps O
, O
we O
were O
seated O
on O
Chefs B-AS
Table I-AS
for O
dinner B-AS
; O
) O
All O
ten O
of O
us O
were O
extremely O
comfortable O
, O
where O
the O
Chef O
came O
personally O
and O
we O
had O
special O
dishes B-AS
that O
were O
pre O
- O
decided O
by O
my O
cousin O
for O
his O
party O
. O

After O
waiting O
forty O
minutes O
for O
our O
brunch B-AS
, O
learned O
that O
the O
waitress B-AS
had O
- O
- O
oops O
! O

i O
have O
been O
waiting B-AS
for O
15 O
mn O
( O
no O

menu I-AS
, O
no O
cocktail B-AS
menu I-AS
, O
no O
one O
even O
say O
hi O
to O
me O
) O
. O

the O
tables B-AS
are O
in O
the O
back O
and O
the O
ambience B-AS
was O
less O
to O
be O
desired O
. O

The O
cooks B-AS
in O
the O
front B-AS
are O
very O
friendly O
and O
helpful O
. O

waitress B-AS
brought O
different O
food B-AS
. O

There O
was O
interesting O
summer O
dessert B-AS
, O
a O
rubarb B-AS
- I-AS
crisp I-AS
with I-AS
basil I-AS
ice I-AS
cream I-AS
. O

There O
is O
no O
menu B-AS
and O
the O
waiter B-AS
never O
told O
us O
how O
much O
lunch B-AS
was O
, O
I O
thought O
it O
couldn O
' O
t O
be O
more O
than O
$ O
35 O
. O

At O
first O
I O
was O
shocked O
by O
the O
price B-AS
, O
but O
the O
excellent O
and O
friendly O
service B-AS
from O
our O
waiter B-AS
Jack O
was O
great O
and O
the O
duck B-AS
salad I-AS
was O
the O
best O
ever O
. O

The O
atmosphere O
was O
a O
+ O
, O
until O
a O
friend O
and O
I O
were O
rudely O
interrrupted O
and O
rushed O
out O
by O
the O
attendant B-AS
at O
the O
door O
when O
the O
check B-AS
was O
only O
returned O
to O
us O
just O
5 O
mins O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
inexcusably O
, O
excruciatingly O
slow O
- O
it O
took O
more O
than O
30 O
min O
to O
get O
the O
first O
round O
of O
drinks B-AS
, O
by O
which O
point O
our O
party O
was O
ready O
to O
walk O
out O
. O

We O
told O
the O
manager B-AS
it O
was O
not O
worth O
a O
few O
appetizers B-AS
to O
be O
treated O
that O
way O
and O
left O
. O

We O
got O
up O
from O
the O
bar B-AS
and O
got O
pushy O
with O
the O
hostess B-AS
and O
finally O
were O
seated O
at O
an O
excellent O
table O
. O

There O
are O
a O
few O
chefs B-AS
who O
aren O
' O
t O
very O
enthusiastic O
and O
not O
very O
theatrical O
, O
but O
the O
end O
product O
is O
always O
great O
food B-AS
. O

also O
you O
dont O
mind O
waiting B-AS
because O
theres O
such O
a O
buzz O
around O
the O
bar B-AS
it O
makes O
you O
feel O
like O
you O
are O
out O
for O
drinks B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
at O
Mercer O
Kitchen B-AS
is O
great O
, O
flavorful O
and O
nicely O
portioned O
. O

Beautiful O
rooms O
filled O
with O
beautiful O
people O
, O
but O
expensive O
for O
what O
it O
is O
( O
$ O
68 O
prix B-AS
fixe I-AS
) O
, O
limited O
menu O
, O
tiny O
portions B-AS
, O
reeeeeeeally O
slow O
service B-AS
, O
undercooked O
potatoes O
with O
the O
cod B-AS
, O
less O
than O
fascinating O
desserts O
. O

The O
dramatic B-AS
space I-AS
complements O
the O
food B-AS
and O
will O
wow O
out O
- O
of O
- O
towners O
. O

Bartender B-AS
, O
should O
not O
be O
taking O
dinner B-AS
orders O
on O
napkins O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
was O
so O
fun O
that O
we O
decided O
to O
have O
another O
cocktail B-AS
at O
the O
bar B-AS
and O
enjoy O
the O
scene B-AS
. O

Besides O
their O

or O
bulgoki B-AS
( I-AS

I O
' O

too O
fond O
of O
their O
traditional O
Korean B-AS
dishes I-AS
. O

check O
it O
out O
but O
i O
cant O
narrow O
down O
what O
to O
order O
cause O
Ive O
always O
had O
v O
good O
food B-AS
from O
pastas B-AS
to O
fish O
! O

If O
I O
were O
to O
spend O
a O
decent O
amount O
of O
cash O
on O
dinner B-AS
, O
I O
' O
d O
go O
someplace O
with O
EXCELLENT O
, O
not O
just O
really O
good O
food B-AS
. O

Our O
dinner B-AS
was O
enhanced O
by O
a O
1999 O
Pinot O
Grigio O
, O
recmmended O
by O
the O
waitress B-AS
. O

I O
tried O
that O
on O
a O
Friday O
, O
told O
the O
guy B-AS
otside O
the O
door O
that O
I O
did O
not O
have O
a O
reservation B-AS
and O
he O
said O
, O
You O
may O
as O
well O
just O
leave O
now O
. O

In O
a O
room O
decorated O
with O
beautiful O
Ottoman O
antiques O
and O
artwork O
you O
can O
pick O
exceptional O
mezzes O
( O
appetizers O
) O
from O
a O
selection O
presented O
by O
a O
super O
- O
friendly O
staff B-AS
or O
order O
lip B-AS
- I-AS
smacking I-AS
dishes I-AS
( O
especially O
if O
you O
like O
lamb O
) O
from O
the O
menu B-AS
. O

Catch O
a O
Yankee O
, O
Mets O
game O
, O
have O
a O
burger B-AS
and O
great O
conversation O
with O
the O
bar B-AS
keep I-AS
. O

The O
extensive O
menu B-AS
spans O
the O
familiar O
, O
with O
dishes B-AS
like O
a O
tataki O
of O
superior O
- O
quality O
beef B-AS
with O
an O
arousing O
ginger O
sauce O
; O
the O
rare O
, O
with O
freshly O
made O
tofu O
, O
its O
ultra O
- O
creamy O
texture B-AS
wowing O
more O
than O
its O
flavor O
. O

From O
the O
intricately O
decorated O
plates O
to O
the O
elaborate B-AS
sushi I-AS
dishes I-AS
, O
it O
is O
everything O
a O
Japanese B-AS
dinner I-AS
should O
be O
. O

Expect O
a O
crowd B-AS
while O
waiting B-AS
, O
but O
they O
seat O
quickly O
. O

Start O
off O
with O
an O
expertly O
mixed B-AS
cocktail I-AS
or O
glass O
of O
wine O
at O
the O
beautiful O
bar B-AS
. O

I O
was O
lured O
in O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
they O
have O
soy O
options O
for O
almost O
everything O
that O
includes O
dairy O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
as O
well O
as O
tofu O
subs O
for O
eggs O
; O
It O
is O
hard O
to O
find O
mexican O
tinged O
food O
with O
an O
optional O
vegetarian O
slant B-AS
. O

After O
the O
rude O
waitress B-AS
took O
our O
order O
we O
were O
sipping O
our O
drinks B-AS
when O
the O
manager B-AS
comes O
over O
and O
says O
we O
have O
to O
leave O
as O
the O
tables O
are O
reserved O

Server B-AS
' O
s O
were O
extremely O
nice O
, O
yet O
were O
socializing O
too O
much O
with O
friends O
that O
were O
having O
drinks O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
and O
it O
was O
difficult O
to O
get O
their O
attention O
. O

Also O
, O
if O
you O
order O
a O
dinner B-AS
, O
plan O
to O
have O
leftovers O
for O
the O
next O
day O
because O
the O
portions B-AS
are O
HUGE O
, O
the O
salad O
that O
comes O
with O
a O
meal O
is O
large O
enough O
to O
be O
a O
meal O
itself O
. O

Fast O
and O
Fresh O
is O
also O
a O
bodega O
, O
and O
they O
have O
the O
usual O
offerings O
: O
cold O
drinks B-AS
in O
the O
fridge O
( O
Corona O
and O
other O
beers O
available O
) O
, O
bagels O
, O
sammiches B-AS
and O
salads B-AS
to O
order O
. O

Although O
the O
homefried O
potatoes O
were O
not O
worth O
the O
plate B-AS
space I-AS
, O
next O
time O
I O
' O
ll O
ask O
to O
substitute O
a O
nice O
salad B-AS
. O

By O
the O
end O
of O
the O
meal B-AS
, O
we O
were O
shaking O
hands O
with O
/ O
hugging O
our O
waiter B-AS
as O
we O
stumbled O
/ O
rolled O
out O
the O
door O
. O

I O
requested O
the O
waiter B-AS
to O
seat O
us O
at O
a O
different O
table B-AS
, O
and O
he O
was O
like O
' O
its O
the O
same O
everywhere O
' O
, O
and O
walked O
off O
. O

They O
had O
a O
great O
wine B-AS
selection I-AS
to O
choose O
from O
, O
the O
single B-AS
mixed I-AS
drinks I-AS
were O
a O
little O
pricey O
. O

For O
example O
, O
the O
flavor B-AS
in O
each O
dish B-AS
didn O
' O
t O
really O
stand O
out O
and O
the O
spanish B-AS
rice I-AS
seemed O
more O
like O
uncle O
ben O
' O
s O
with O
peas O
and O
corn O
mixed O
in O
. O

Other O
than O
the O
too O
fruity O
drinks O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
which O
wasn O
' O
t O
my O
cup O
of O
tea B-AS
, O
everything O
else O
was O
excellent O
. O

The O
Food O
Scott O
Ehrlich O
' O

cerebral O
New B-AS
American I-AS
food I-AS
demands O
both O
close O
attention O
and O
a O
certain O
amount O
of O
faith O
; O
even O
when O
dishes B-AS
aren O
' O
t O
entirely O
successful O
, O
they O
manage O
to O
be O
compelling O
. O

interesting O
back B-AS
patio I-AS
- O
curious O
what O
it O
would O
be O
like O
for O
lunch B-AS
. O

We O
were O
a O
party O
of O
six O
and O
I O
had O
tried O
almost O
everything O
that O
was O
on O
the O
table B-AS
, O
and O
had O
I O
been O
rich O
I O
would O
have O
hired O
the O
chef B-AS
to O
cook O
only O
for O
me O
! O

the O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
trendy O
, O
i O
think O
it O
' O
s O
better O
to O
come O
here O
for O
a O
drink B-AS
rather O
than O
dinner B-AS
. O

Great O
place O
for O
either O
appetizers O
and O
drinks B-AS
at O
the O
bar B-AS
, O
a O
romantic O
dinner O
or O
late O
night O
partying O
. O

The O
menu B-AS
can O
give O
you O
price B-AS
shock O
but O
the O
food B-AS
, O
service B-AS
and O
drinks B-AS
are O
worth O
every O
stinking O
penny O
. O

I O
went O
there O
on O
my O
2nd O
day O
in O
New O
York O
ever O
for O
a O
quick O
lunch B-AS
and O
ended O
up O
staying O
and O
chatting O
with O
the O
owners B-AS
wife O
and O
a O
waiter B-AS
, O
Javi O
for O
two O
hours O
. O

The O
main B-AS
floor I-AS
space I-AS
is O
lovely O
, O
but O
cavernous O
( O
which O
means O
* O
VERY O
* O
noisy O
) O
, O
so O
our O
server B-AS
was O
especially O
patient O
with O
us O
since O
we O
couldn O
' O
t O
hear O
each O
other O
or O

half O

who O
all O

The O
food B-AS
as O
always O
was O
fantastic O
, O
and O
the O
pricing B-AS
was O
moderate O
although O
I O
was O
not O
happy O
about O
the O
18 O
% O
gratuity B-AS
being O
added O
for O
parties O
over O

especially O
after O
the O

a O

The O
orange B-AS

signalling O
the O

of O
the O
dinner B-AS
was O
brought O
to O
our O
table O
even O
though O
we O
were O
still O
eating O
the O
main O
entrees B-AS
. O

I O
came O
to O
have O
dinner B-AS
with O
two O
of O
my O
girlfriends O
on O
saturday O
and O
had O
an O
awsome O
time B-AS
. O

Aperitif O
was O
the O
Casablanca O
; O
it O
was O
served B-AS
carelessly O
with O
ice B-AS
chunks I-AS
large O
enough O
to O
sink O
the O
Titanic O
. O

The O
pretty O
waitstaff B-AS
is O
always O
pleasant O
, O
but O
service B-AS
is O
inconsistent O
at O
best O
. O

They O
were O
seating O
people O
without O
reservations B-AS
who O
were O
either O
friends O
of O
the O
employees B-AS
or O
were O
slipping O

parmigiana I-AS
and O
so O
on O
. O

After O
dinner B-AS
the O
manager B-AS
grabbed O
my O
boyfriend O
, O
asked O
him O
: O
Where O
are O
you O
from O
. O

Each O
entre O
came O
with O
a O
side O
of O
rice O
and O
bread O
( O
most O

you O
have O
order O
the O
bread O
separately O
) O
, O
dal B-AS
( O

) O
and O
fresh O
vegetable B-AS

A O
simple O
dish B-AS
like O
Fattouch B-AS
or O
Tabbouleh O
are O
turned O
into O
the O
most O
delicious O
salad B-AS
youll O
ever O
have O
. O

We O
were O
first O
greeted O
by O
a O
very O
friendly O
hostess O
who O
asked O
if O
we O
had O
reservations B-AS
- O
even O
though O
we O
didn O
' O
t O
they O
were O
VERY O
accommodating O
- O
we O
sat O
at O
the O
bar O
and O
spoke O
to O
the O
VERY O
nice O
bartender B-AS
who O
recommended O
a O
GREAT O
wine B-AS
and O
gave O
us O
some O
brucetta O
to O
munch O
on O
while O
we O
waited O
. O

Full O
of O
characters O
from O
the O
neighborhood O

it O
' O

a O
fun O
place B-AS
to O
meet O
up O
with O
friends O
or O
have O
a O
drink B-AS
at O
the O
bar B-AS
. O

You O
must O
think O
that O
the O
quality B-AS
is O
poor O
for O
them O
to O
sell O
it O
for O
such O
a O
low O
price B-AS
. O

50 O
a O
better O
meal B-AS
on O
the O
go O
than O
pizza B-AS
. O

I O
had O
oysters B-AS
for O
my O
appetizer B-AS
and O
the O
Turbot B-AS
with O
a O
delicate O
creamy B-AS
lemon I-AS
sauce I-AS
with O
a O
hint B-AS
of I-AS
dill I-AS
for O
dinner B-AS

I O
checked O
this O
place O
out O
during O
the O
blizzard O

was O
thrilled O
to O
discover O

The O
Food B-AS
The O
restaurant O
boasts O
an O
impressive O
raw O
bar B-AS
and O
samplings O
from O
the O
bait O
menu B-AS
a O
big O
draw O
. O

Much O
has O
been O
made O
of O

- O
space B-AS
and O

are O
cited O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
- O
- O
but O
an O
order O
of O
thick O
crispy O
salt B-AS
and I-AS
vinegar I-AS
chips I-AS
almost O
satisfies O
the O
craving O
. O

Well O
i O
asked O
the O
server B-AS
to O
describe O
a O
certain O
wine B-AS
for O
me O
, O
he O
seemed O
like O
he O
knew O
what O
he O
was O
talking O
about O
, O
till O
i O
tasted O
it O
, O
it O
was O
totally O
the O
opposite O
of O
what O
he O
described O
. O

Growling O
at O
us O
when O
we O
asked O
for O
water B-AS
is O
one O
thing O
, O
but O
to O
just O
lie O
and O
make O
NO O
effort O
to O
satisfy O
, O
or O
apologize O
at O
these O
moderately O
high O
prices B-AS
( O
$ O
12 O
. O

Food O
is O
decent O
but O
portions B-AS
so O
small O
that O
after O
5 O
appetizers B-AS
, O
2 O
sides B-AS
and O
three O
entrees B-AS
, O
the O
three O
of O
us O
left O
still O
hungry O
! O

The O
scene B-AS
was O
sassy O
and O
cool O
, O
but O
i O
would O
never O
eat O
dinner B-AS
here O
again O
. O

and O
they O
have O
this O
great O
deal O
: O
6 O
oysters B-AS
on O
the O
half O
shell O
and O
your O
choice B-AS
of O
beer O
, O
or O
wine B-AS
for O
only O
$ O
7 O
! O

The O
waiter B-AS
simply O
comped O
off O
our O
appetizer O
and O
then O
stayed O
away O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
night O
- O
- O
we O
waited O
an O
additional O
twenty O
minutes O
after O
we O
were O
done O
eating O
for O
the O
check B-AS

all O

- O
Il O
Mulino O
is O
the O
best O
for O
both O

if O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
fabulous O
dinner B-AS
in I-AS
/ I-AS
out I-AS
- O
this O
restaurant O
is O
it O
! O

The O
food B-AS
is O
spicy O
like O
it O
should O
be O
not O
swimming O
in O
oil B-AS
like O
it O
is O
at O
song O
down O
the O
street O
. O

I O
' O
m O
sorry O
, O
but O
the O
prices B-AS
at O
Boi O
are O
outrageous O
for O
this O
type O
of O
cuisine B-AS
. O

It O
was O
worth O
the O
wait B-AS
, O
an O
hour O
, O
without O
a O
reservation B-AS
, O
for O
an O
out O
of O
this O
world O
meal O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
decent O
, O
but O
for O
what O
the O
bill B-AS
comes O
to O
, O
it O
' O
s O
just O
not O
worth O
it O
. O

Our O
waiter B-AS
was O
apparently O
angry O
to O
have O
to O
be O
serving B-AS
, O
because O
it O
took O
him O
15 O
minutes O
to O
even O
bring O
water O
, O
let O
alone O
take O
a O
drink B-AS
order O
( O
it O
was O
early O
on O
in O
the O
day O
and O
the O
restaurant O
was O
not O
even O
50 O
% O
full O
, O
so O
he O
was O
NOT O
busy O
) O
. O

Last O
visit O
, O
ignored O
by O
our O
waiter B-AS
, O
we O
finally O
got O
beers O
and O
ordered O
food B-AS
. O

The O
entire O
restaurant O
staff B-AS
was O
disappointing O
to O
begin O
with O
( O
any O
waiters B-AS
over O
17 O
with O
some O
knowledge O
of O
the O
menu B-AS
or O
wine O
? O

Unless O
you O
like O
getting O
bumped O
by O
waiters B-AS
and O
people O
walking O
by O
, O
do O
not O
sit O
at O
a O
middle O
table B-AS
. O

Justin O
our O
waiter B-AS
, O
explained O
to O
us O
that O
the O
menu B-AS
changes O
daily O
, O
more O
of O
a O
reason O
to O
return O
. O

The O
atmosphere O
and O
clientele B-AS
often O
evoke O
the O
feeling O
of O
being O
at O
a O
friend O
' O
s O
dinner B-AS
party O
, O
where O
people O
linger O
over O
wine B-AS
, O
and O
chat O
over O
small O
plates O
of O
food B-AS
. O

And O
who O
else O
has O
this O
great O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
to O
go O
with O
pizza B-AS
? O

After O
being O
given O
a O
bad O
table B-AS
at O
Becco O
and O
leaving O
there O
, O
we O
walked O
around O
and O
decided O
on O
Da O
Rosina O
because O
the O
price B-AS
was O
right O
and O
the O
menu B-AS
looked O
good O
. O

Obviously O
bz O
place O
, O
greeting O
was O
less O
than O
welcoming O
, O
service B-AS
was O
adequate O
from O
less O
than O
friendly O
waiters B-AS
, O
steak O
for O
2 O
was O
anything O
but O
spectacular O
served O
with O
sauce O
that O
' O
s O
better O
suited O
for O
seafood O
than O
meat B-AS
. O

Dinner B-AS
was O
very O
rushed O
- O
the O
waiter B-AS
was O
bringing O
out O
the O
main O
course O
even O
before O
we O
had O
finished O
the O
appetizer B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
average O
, O
however O
the O
service B-AS
is O
way O
below O
average O
( O
our O
waiter B-AS
was O
a O
stuttering O
fool O
when O
it O
came O
to O
the O
specials O
and O
left O
our O
drinks B-AS
empty O
for O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
night O
) O
The O
atmostphere B-AS
is O
cheesy O
as O
well O
as O
the O
crowd B-AS
. O

The O
seating B-AS
arrangment I-AS
isn O
' O
t O
the O
most O
practical O
because O
people O
get O
in O
the O
way O
of O
each O
other O
a O
lot O
, O
but O
the O
food B-AS
makes O
it O
worth O
it O

I O
had O
the O
item O
that O
they O
forgot O
to O
put O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
; O
some O
very O
tasty O
fish B-AS
over O
jasmine O

with I-AS

The O
waiters B-AS
seemed O
annoyed O
we O
all O
ordered O
the O
restaurant O

menu B-AS
and O
were O
going O
to O
cut O
into O
their O
tips O

Before O

For O
an O

I O
should O
have O
been O
more O
adventurous O

every O

that O
aroused O

I O
went O
for O
the O
Portabello O
sandwich O
. O

The O
kicker O
was O
when O
there O
were O
three O
items O
on O
our O
check O
that O
were O
priced B-AS
higher O
than O
stated O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
and O
by O
the O
server B-AS
. O

The O
servers B-AS
didn O
' O
t O
know O
what O
tables B-AS
the O
meals B-AS
were O
going O
to O
, O
it O
was O
a O
complete O
comedy O
show O
. O

Though O
the O
service B-AS
is O
speedy O
be O
prepared O
to O
wait O
at O
least O
20 O
minutes O
for O
the O
soup B-AS
dumplings I-AS
. O

Obviously O
we O
did O
not O
get O
right O
service B-AS
and O
nobody O
said O
soory O
for O
that O
and O
other O
restaurant O
guests O
who O
came O
after O
us O
got O
quicker O
dish B-AS
than O
us O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
good O
but O
our O
waiters B-AS
were O
pushy O
, O
rude O
and O
dumb O
. O

At O
any O
rate O
, O
the O
waiter B-AS
totally O
forgot O
about O
us O
and O
we O
had O
to O
hail O
him O
down O
a O
couple O
of O
times O
just O
to O
get O
the O
specials B-AS
and O
to O
order O
. O

We O
went O
again O
and O
sat O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
this O
time O
, O
I O
had O
5 O
pints O
of O
guinness O
and O
not O
one O
buy O
- O
back O
, O
I O
ordered O
a O
basket O
of O
onion B-AS
rings I-AS
and O
there O
were O
about O
5 O
in O
the O
basket O
, O
the O
rest O
was O
filled O
with O
crumbs O
, O
the O
chili B-AS
was O
not O
even O
edible O
. O

It O
has O
the O
most O
authentic O
Mexican B-AS
found O
I O
have O
found O
in O
the O
Metro O
area B-AS
and O
the O
margaritas B-AS
are O
outstanding O
. O

However O
, O
everything O
we O
ate O
was O
salted O
to O
an O
extreme O
, O
and O
the O
steak B-AS
, O
so O
regrettably O
, O
was O
saturated O
with O
butter B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
, O
congeniality O
, O
and O
service O
have O
all O
deteriorated O
overf O
the O
past O
few O
years O
and O
so O
the O
wait B-AS
is O
not O
worth O
it O
. O

Suprising O
was O
the O
cheese B-AS
selections I-AS
that O
were O
sort O
of O
dessert B-AS
as O
well O
. O

My O
doubts O
were O
cleared O
immediately O
, O
the O
host B-AS
was O
friendly O
and O
yes O
they O
suggest O
the O
pitcher O
of O
sangria O
before O
you O
look O
at O
the O
menu B-AS
but O
you O
should O
take O
it O
anyway O
! O

When O
you O
crave O
comfort O
food B-AS
, O
make O
a O
reservation B-AS
and O
head O
to O
Piccolo O
Angolo O
, O
they O
never O
dissappoint O
. O

Waiter B-AS
took O
our O
drink B-AS
order I-AS
and O
then O
we O
didn O
' O
t O
see O
him O
for O
15 O
minutes O
. O

For O
dessert B-AS
the O
waiter B-AS
reccomended O
his O
favorite O
which O
was O
a O
Torreja O
. O

Caravan O
can O
be O
a O
little O
slow O
sometimes O
, O
but O
more O
than O
makes O
up O
for O
it O
in O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
food B-AS
and O
the O
care B-AS
of O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
. O

Short O
of O
being O
invited O
to O
a O
Filipino O
home O
for O
dinner B-AS
, O
Elvie O
' O
s O
is O
the O
closest O
you O
' O
ll O
get O
to O
tasting O
Filipino O
delights B-AS
. O

Although O
the O
place B-AS
had O
an O
actual O
makeover O
not O
long O
ago O
, O
the O
food B-AS
or O
chef O
needs O
to O
be O
changed O
. O

It O
' O
s O
so O
out O
there O
that O
it O
works O
- O
- O
black O
- O
clad O
raver O
waiters B-AS
and O
all O
- O
- O
and O
even O
the O
most O
normal O
of O
groups O
love O
getting O
together O
for O
dinner B-AS
and O
popular O
brunching O
on O
the O
palm O
- O
lined O
backyard B-AS
patio I-AS
spread I-AS
. O

Mind O
you O
, O
we O
had O
not O
finished O
drinking O
our O
Sangria B-AS
( O
which O
absolutely O
sucked O
) O
nor O
eating O
our O
tapas B-AS
( O
which O
took O
forever O
to O
arrive O
) O
. O

The O
kitchen B-AS
is O
open O
and O
surrounded O
by O
bar B-AS
seating I-AS
( O
the O
only O
kind O
of O
seating O
) O
, O
and O
they O
have O
a O
nice O
set O
- O
up O
where O
the O
waitress B-AS
stays O
behind O
the O
bar O
and O
the O
chefs B-AS
deliver O
your O
food B-AS
after O
you O
have O
watched O
them O
prepare O
it O
. O

The O
limited O
number O
of O
toppings O
prevented O
the O
sogginess O
described O
by O
other O
reviewers O
and O
allowed O
the O
intense O
flavors O
from O
the O
fresh O
ingredients B-AS
; O
sauce O
, O
mozarella B-AS
, O
basil O
and O
black B-AS
olives I-AS
to O
really O
shine O
through O
, O
without O
being O
watered O
down O
from O
too O
many O
extra O
toppings O
. O

The O
lobster B-AS
bisque I-AS
was O
good O
, O
but O
the O
price B-AS
of I-AS
adding I-AS
lobster I-AS
meat I-AS
was O
astronomical O
. O

One O
night O
we O
landed O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
for O
a O
late O
night O
dinner O
, O
and O
the O
hanger B-AS
steak I-AS
and O
frites B-AS
w I-AS
/ I-AS
marjoram I-AS
aioli O
was O
the O
BEST O
. O

Tip O
: O
go O
for O
lunch B-AS
early O
, O
12 O
: O
00 O
say O
, O
when O
the O
place O
and O
street O
is O
quiet O
and O
enjoy O
the O
romantic O
and O
charming O
setting B-AS
and O
delicious O
food B-AS
. O

In O
Short O
Custard O
Beach O
is O
located O
in O
the O
lower O
- O
level O
dining B-AS
concourse I-AS
of O
Grand O
Central O
Terminal O
, O
which O
features O
seating B-AS
, O
many O
dining B-AS
choices I-AS
and O
a O
crowd O
of O
tourists O
and O
commuters O
. O

The O
menu B-AS
has O
been O
changed O
to O
a O
mostly O
unhealthy O
one O
, O
adding O
bacon B-AS
even O
to O
the O
fish B-AS
dishes I-AS
( O
sometimes O
with O
no O
notice O
) O
, O
so O
if O
youre O
looking O
for O
vegetarian O
or O
even O
just O
healthy O
seafood B-AS
dishes I-AS
, O
you O
wont O
find O
much O
. O

I O
for O
one O
do O
not O
plan O
to O
go O
back O
, O
there O
are O
many O
other O
places O
in O
Manhattan O
that O
have O
just O
as O
good O
food B-AS
if O
not O
better O
, O
at O
the O
same O
prices B-AS
with O
much O
better O
service B-AS
. O

Not O
always O
consistent O
with O
cooking O
the O
steak B-AS
( O
we O
wanted O
really O
rare O
and O
it O
was O
a O
bit O
more O
well O
done O
than O
that O
) O
but O
still O
fantastic O
with O
a O
great O
cut O
and O
dependable O
sides B-AS
. O

Every O
time O
I O
go O
I O
order O
the O
eggs B-AS
benedict I-AS
which O
comes O
with O
home O
fries O
and O
an O
alcoholic O
beverage B-AS
. O

Although O
the O
service B-AS
was O
top O
notch O
, O
all O
of O
the O
food B-AS
was O
disappointing O
: O
burnt O
octopus O
, O
bland O
ravioli O
, O
odd O
tasting O
mint O
love O
letters O
. O

The O
only O
downside O
was O
our O
waitress B-AS
- O
- O
she O
forgot O
to O
order O
one O
of O
our O
side B-AS
dishes I-AS
, O
was O
not O
attentive O
, O
and O
then O
gave O
us O
our O
check O
before O
we O
finished O
our O
bottle O
of O
wine B-AS
. O

We O
didn O
' O
t O
have O
reservations B-AS
, O
and O
showing O
up O
at O
8 O
: O
45 O
we O
were O
told O
it O
would O
be O
about O
an O
hour O
wait B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
ranges O
from O
okay O
to O
delicious O
and O
the O
service B-AS
varies O
from O
great O
to O
poor O
. O

For O
breakfast B-AS
there O
are O
a O
wide O
variety O
of O
whole O
grain B-AS
pancakes I-AS
; O
pumpkin O
is O
my O
favorite O
, O
blueberry O
second O
! O

The O
first O
time O
we O
went O
there O
had O
been O
a O
party O
of O
10 O
that O
was O
just O
seated O
and O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
tables B-AS
were O
all O
full O
, O
so O
we O
decided O
to O
take O
the O
drinks B-AS
to O
go O
. O

But O
then O
there O
' O
s O
the O
sluggish O
and O
absentminded O
service B-AS
: O
twice O
someone O
tried O
to O
serve O
us O
something O
for O
another O
table B-AS
and O
it O
took O
a O
long O
time O
to O
get O
our O
check O
. O

nothing O
more O
than O

For O

and O

) O
, O
the O
food O
and O
presentation O
was O
just O
average O
. O

the O
staff O
there O
was O
really O
freindly O
the O
owner B-AS
even O
sat O
down O
at O
one O
point O
to O
chat O
with O
us O
, O
it O
was O
hard O
to O
chose O
from O
the O
menu B-AS
it O
all O
sounded O
good O
, O
so O
my O
wife O
and O
i O
shared O
plates O
to O
try O
a O
little O
of O
each O
dish O
, O
we O
ordered O
. O

We O
waited O
in O
the O
bar B-AS
area I-AS
and O
had O
an O
excellent O
time B-AS
waiting O
for O
dinner B-AS
with O
the O
bartender O
and O
staff B-AS
. O

Each O
appetizer B-AS
was O
a O
success O
: O
lobster B-AS
bisque I-AS
, O
fried O
clams O
, O
scallops O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
good O
but O
for O
the O
prices B-AS
, O
it O
was O
definitely O
not O
worth O
it O
. O

We O
ordered O
the O
recommended O
dessert B-AS
ahead O
of O
time O
as O
they O
suggested O
but O
when O
it O
came O
time O
for O
it O
, O
the O
waiter B-AS
had O
forgotten O
it O
. O

The O
steak B-AS
, O
duck B-AS
and O
soft B-AS
shell I-AS
crab I-AS
are O
musts O
for O
dinner B-AS
and O
almost O
every O
side O
dish B-AS
was O
great O
. O

It O
has O
a O
large O
salad B-AS

, O
many O
side B-AS
dishes I-AS
, O

hot O
and O
fresh O
and O
fast O
, O
though O
you O
' O
ll O
probably O
have O
to O
wait O
for O
a O
table B-AS
. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
the O
meal B-AS
, O
I O
politely O
asked O
the O
waitress B-AS
whether O
she O
would O
comp O
something O
, O
and O
she O
said O
yes O
. O

When O
we O
ordered O
our O
Margaritas B-AS
, O
the O
waiter B-AS
said O
$ O
10 O
, O
so O
we O
gave O
him O
a O
20 O
and O
waited O
, O
and O
when O
he O
didn O
' O
t O
give O
us O
our O
change O
, O
we O
asked O
and O
he O
said O
- O
Happy O
Hour O
' O
s O
over O
, O
they O
' O
re O
$ O
10 O
each O
. O

It O
is O
now O
nothing O
but O
an O
overpriced O
establishment B-AS
that O
is O
shamelessly O
riding O
on O
the O
coat B-AS
tails I-AS
of O
its O
past O
. O

But O
the O
food B-AS
here O
is O
excellant O
and O
there O
are O
just O
too O
many O
appetizers B-AS
( O
in O
the O
traditional O
custom B-AS
of O
Korean O
restaurants O
) O
to O
sample O
. O

one O
of O
us O
still O
had O
wine B-AS
, O
so O
the O
others O
tried O
to O
order O
dessert B-AS
drinks I-AS
, O
but O
the O
owner B-AS
told O
us O
no O
because O
there O
were O
people O
waiting B-AS
and O
the O
waiter B-AS
said O
if O
he O
served B-AS
us O
more O
he O
would O
be O
fired O
. O

Went O
for O
restaurant O

and O
surprisingly O
on O
the O

were O

options I-AS
of I-AS

Kobe B-AS

some O

things O
in O
very O
reasonable O
portions B-AS

I O
have O
tried O
everything O
available O
on O
the O
AYCE O
menu B-AS
, O
it O
has O
all O
been O
quite O
good O
( O
although O
I O
am O
not O
one O
to O
be O
especially O
particular O
with O

as O
of O
late O
though O
( O
maybe O

) O
the O
food B-AS
quality I-AS
dropped O
with O

and O
the O
service B-AS
got O
worse O
. O

Spring B-AS

did O
not O
taste O
very O
fresh O
, O
soup B-AS
ok O
but O
only O
had O

. O

Overall O
, O
reasonable O
food B-AS
for O

for O
Pre B-AS
- I-AS

( O

. O

The O
brief O
list B-AS
of O
desserts B-AS
includes O
a O
rich O
chocolate O
marquise O
and O
a O
lemony O
banana O
- O
cream O
pie B-AS
. O

I O
was O
accompanied O
by O
foodies O
, O
yet O
the O
waiter B-AS
treated O
the O
few O
questions O
people O
had O
about O
the O
menu B-AS
as O
if O
he O
was O
dealing O
with O
diners B-AS
who O
had O
never O
eaten O
at O
a O
decent O
restaurant O
. O

We O
sat O
way O
before O
2 O
other O
tables O
ahead O
of O
us O
that O
rec O
' O
d O
their O
appetizers B-AS
before O
us O
; O
the O
waiter B-AS
neglected O
to O
apologize O
. O

fish B-AS
was O
fresh O
enough O
, O
but O
the O
quality B-AS
was O
only O
so O
- O
so O
( O
the O
salmon B-AS
was O
especially O
sinewy O
) O
. O

Thankfully O
, O
a O
succinct O
menu B-AS
leaves O
little O
to O
ponder O
- O
- O
and O
, O
despite O
the O
high O
churn O
, O
burgers B-AS
always O
arrive O
as O
specified O
. O

The O
place B-AS
is O
small O
, O
or O
at O
lease O
it O
felt O
that O
way O
b O
/ O
c O
tables B-AS
were O
right O
on O
top O
of O
each O
other O
. O

The O
Food O
Mi O
Nidito O
' O

menu B-AS
offers O
a O
considerable O
array B-AS
of O
Mexican O
standards O
, O
with O
a O
separate O
page O
for O
seafood B-AS
, O
such O
as O
King O

enchiladas O
, O
and O
another O
for O
vegetarian O
dishes O
such O
as O
almond O

Our O
waitress B-AS
had O
a O
French O
accent O
and O
her O
caring O
and O
knowledgeable O
attitude O
she O
discplayed O
with O
each O

led O
us O
to O
beleive O
she O
was O
the O
owner B-AS
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
average O
- O
the O
waiter B-AS
did O
not O
check O
in O
on O
our O
meals O
and O
did O
not O
even O
refill O
the O
water B-AS
, O
but O
was O
a O
bit O
pushy O
on O
desert O
( O
we O
both O
ordered O
schnapps O
) O
. O

While O
certain O
staples B-AS
are O
excellent O
( O
the O
burger B-AS
, O
some O
of O
the O
pastas B-AS
) O
, O
the O
food B-AS
is O
not O
really O
the O
point O
. O

We O
were O
a O
large O
party O
, O
over O
6 O
people O
, O
and O
after O
our O
initial B-AS
drinks I-AS
, O
which O
included O
a O
couple O
bottles O
of O
wine O
, O
and O
order O
were O
taken O
we O
did O
not O
see O
a O
waiter B-AS
or O
a O
busboy B-AS
again O
for O
over O
an O
hour O
! O
! O

Our O
waiter B-AS
was O
courteous O
and O
knew O
the O
menu B-AS
well O
, O
though O
he O
was O
a O
little O
pushy O
with O
the O
bottles B-AS
of I-AS
wine I-AS
. O

After O
45 O
mins O
of O
waiting O
in O
an O
sans O
air O
conditioned O
bar B-AS
, O
we O
grew O
tired O
of O
paying O
for O
over O
- O
priced O
drinks B-AS
. O

The O
best O
dish B-AS
is O
not O
listed O
on O
their O
menu B-AS
- O
it O
is O
a O
special O
- O
the O
flat B-AS
pasta I-AS
with I-AS
truffle I-AS
mushroom I-AS
sauce I-AS
. O

Never O
heard O
anything O
about O
a O
minimum O
required O
food B-AS
order O
of O
$ O
30 O
or O
had O
any O
bad O
experiences O
with O
the O
staff B-AS
. O

Long O
wait O
for O
our O
meal B-AS
( O
approx O
30 O
minutes O
) O
, O
unusual O
slow O
service B-AS
, O
waitresses B-AS
( O
especially O
the O
preety O
one O
with O
black O
hair O
) O
louder O
thn O
clients O
, O
do O
not O
care O
much O
for O
customers O
. O

The O
only O
cuisines O
that O
will O
provide O
comparable O
quality O
in O
the O
vicinity B-AS
are O
Greek O
( O
if O
you O
know O
where O
to O
look O
) O
and O
Pizza B-AS
. O

I O
defy O
anyone O
to O
tell O
me O
where O
else O
you O
can O
cut O
the O
steak B-AS
with O
your O
fork B-AS
, O
it O
practically O
melts O
in O
your O
mouth O
- O
and O
the O
sides B-AS
are O
amazing O
. O

my O
personal O
favorite O
is O
the O
meat B-AS
pie I-AS
( O
which O
uses O
meat B-AS
sauce I-AS
instead O
of O
regular O
marinara O
sauce O
) O
. O

The O
only O
failing O
was O
the O
persian B-AS
tea I-AS
, O
that O
I O
' O
m O
used O
to O
being O
sweetened O
with O
honey B-AS
. O

I O
don O
' O
t O
claim O
that O
the O
place B-AS
as O
the O
most O
authentic O
, O
but O
when O
you O
' O
re O
talking O
about O
Southeast O
Asian O
street O
food B-AS
, O
which O
really O
represents O
a O
melting O
pot B-AS
of O
cultures O
and O
have O
slight O
variation O
in O
style O
for O
many O
similarly O
- O
named O
dishes O
depending O
where O
yuo O
' O
re O
specifically O
from O
, O
who O
' O
s O
to O
claim O
what O
' O
s O
authentic O
? O

My O
friends O
and O
I O
went O
to O
dinner B-AS
last O
weekend O
and O
had O
a O
great O
time B-AS
. O

Avoid O
this O
restaurant O
on O
a O
busy O
night O
at O
all O
costs O
- O
- O
they O
have O
yet O
to O
learn O
how O
to O
make O
the O
appropriate O
number O
of O
reservations B-AS
; O
the O
front O
of O
the O
house O
and O
the O
managers B-AS
are O
amateurs O
. O

When O
spending O
upwards O
of O
$ O
200 O
for O
dinner B-AS
for O
two O
, O
I O
expect O
better O
service B-AS
. O

MeetLESS O
gives O
you O
a O
dance O
club B-AS
w O
/ O
o O
the O
dance O
floor O
a O
restaurant O
w O
/ O
horrendous O
service B-AS
and O
limited O
menu B-AS
selections O
( O
the O
ONLY O
steak B-AS
is O
a O
top O
sirloin O
? O
! O
! O
! O
) O

Appetizers O
, O
such O
as O
sweet O
grilled O
scallops O
with O
butter O
, O
and O
mouthwatering O
grilled O
yellowtail O
collar O
, O
are O
mostly O
excellent O
, O
though O
some O
, O
like O
mushrooms B-AS
stuffed O
with O
bland O
poached B-AS
fish I-AS
, O
fall O
flat B-AS
. O

You O
can O
' O
t O
go O
wrong O
with O
this O
spicy O
sausage O
, O
better O
than O
the O
chicken B-AS
or O
beef O
which O
would O
be O
much O
better O
if O
it O
were O
seared O
rather O
than O
limply O
fried B-AS
on O
the O
skillet O
. O

The O
Food O
The O
Portuguese O
knack O
for O
exploration O
couldn O
' O
t O
be O
more O
apparent O
on O
the O
expansive O
menu B-AS
, O
which O
moves O
beyond O
classics O
like O
bacalhau O
to O
encompass O
a O
world O
of O
former O
colonies O
along O
with O
the O
motherland B-AS
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
the O
Risotto B-AS
with O
pear O
and O
spinach B-AS
, O
the O
lasagna O
, O
and O
the O
salads O
. O

Delicious O
appetizers B-AS
and O
entrees B-AS
, O
our O
server B-AS
recommended O
a O
wonderful O
bottle B-AS
of I-AS
wine I-AS
, O
and O
we O
couldn O
' O
t O
resist O
dessert B-AS
. O

My O
only O
complaint O
is O
that O
the O
place O
is O
over O
crowded O
on O
weekends O
, O
but O
that O
' O
s O
the O
price B-AS
you O
pay O
for O
having O
such O
great O
food B-AS
. O

The O
entree B-AS
menu I-AS
is O
not O
diverse O
, O
but O
the O
items B-AS
on O
it O
are O
all O
very O
good O
. O

So O
I O
go O
into O
the O
bar B-AS
, O
and O
I O
ask O
the O
( O
extremely O
hot O
) O
waitress B-AS
, O
what O
' O
s O
the O
soup O
of O
the O
day O
? O

Each O
week O
, O
Zutto O
' O
s O
sushi B-AS
chef I-AS
never O
ceases O
to O
amaze O
me O
with O
new O
concoctions B-AS
. O

For O
dessert B-AS
, O
there O
' O
s O
sublime O
cheesecake B-AS
. O

The O
place B-AS
was O
busy O
, O
but O
the O
comfortable O
banquets B-AS
and O
friendly O
service B-AS
made O
me O
not O
mind O
waiting B-AS
a O
little O
extra O
while O
for O
my O
food B-AS
to O
come O
out O
. O

It O
might O
be O
a O
good O
place O
to O
have O
a O
drink B-AS
, O
but O
not O
for O
food B-AS
. O

We O
went O
there O
on O
New O
Year O
' O
s O
Day O
around O
7 O
pm O
without O
a O
reservation B-AS
and O
were O
able O
to O
get O
a O
table O
right O
away O
thanks O
to O
the O
very O
accomodating O
hostess B-AS
. O

Kid O
faves O
include O
grilled B-AS
cheese I-AS
and O
, O
quite O
possibly O
, O
the O
biggest O
peanut B-AS
butter I-AS
and I-AS
jelly I-AS
sandwich I-AS
in O
New O
York O
City O
. O

Since O
then O
, O
he O
cannot O
get O
enough O
of O
their O
salmon B-AS
roll I-AS
, O
and O
spicy O
tuna B-AS
roll I-AS
. O

the O
waitress B-AS
was O
probably O
new O
, O
because O
she O
had O
no O
idea O
what O
wine B-AS
they O
had O
, O
or O
if O
they O
had O
a O
certain O
type O
by O
the O
glass B-AS
or O
bottle O
, O
and O
kept O
going O
back O
to O
the O
bar O
to O
find O
out O
. O

I O
would O
love O
the O
owner B-AS
to O
consider O
hosting O
a O
' O
tango O
bar B-AS
' O
once O
- O
twice O
a O
week O
. O

For O
the O
price B-AS
I O
paid O
for O
a O
cup B-AS
of O
Bustelo B-AS
coffee I-AS
w O
/ O
milk O
I O
could O
buy O
2 O
vacumed O
packs O
for O
3 O
bucks O
. O

Everything O
from O
the O
little O
tastes O
prepared O
by O
the O
kitchen O
to O
the O
main B-AS
course I-AS
to O
dessert B-AS
was O
outstanding O
and O
the O
beauty O
of O
the O
restaurant O
makes O
it O
that O
much O
nicer O
. O

Our O
waitress B-AS
was O
so O
helpful O
with O
the O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
. O

The O
menu B-AS
, O
fortunately O
, O
matches O
the O
other O
locations O
, O
covering O
the O
basics O
of O
Ethiopian O
cooking O
, O
and O
includes O
sambosas B-AS
, O
kifto O
( O
chopped O
beef O
often O
served O
raw O
) O
, O
tibs O
( O
lamb O
sauteed O
with O
rosemary O
) O
, O
and O
, O
of O
course O
, O
injera O
, O
the O
spongy O
bread B-AS
that O
doubles O
as O
a O
utensil O
. O

Staff B-AS
wouldn O
' O
t O
take O
no O
for O
an O
answer O
on O
pitchers O
of O
sangria B-AS
. O

They O
brought O
fresh O
naan B-AS
to O
the O
table O
as O
well O
as O
a O
kind O
of O
crepe B-AS
filled I-AS
with I-AS
potatoes I-AS
that O
was O
cooked O
on O
a O
griddle O
set O
up O
by O
the O
window B-AS
. O

I O
honestly O
do O
not O
understand O
how O
anyone O
can O
not O
love O
this O
place B-AS
, O
unless O
they O
don O
' O
t O
like O
real O
pizza B-AS
. O

Make O
a O
reservation B-AS
, O
and O
if O
possible O
grab O
a O
seat B-AS
outside O
, O
even O
on O
cool O
days O
the O
heat B-AS
torches O
work O
great O
. O

The O
space B-AS
is O
small O
and O
reservations B-AS
are O
definitly O
needed O
. O

It O
is O
a O
small O
restaurant O
so O
without O
reservations B-AS
, O
there O
can O
be O
a O
long O
wait B-AS
. O

Even O
if O
you O
hate O
beets B-AS
, O
try O
the O
beet B-AS
ravioli I-AS
- O
you O
will O
not O
be O
disappointed O
! O

For O
roughly O
$ O
10 O
- O
12 O
one O
can O
get O
themselves O
a O
healthy O
burger B-AS
decked O
with O
toppings O
, O
fries O
, O
and O
a O
drink B-AS
, O
a O
meal O
that O
makes O
the O
neighboring O
fast O
food B-AS
places O
look O
inferior O
. O

Po O
has O
the O
best O
food B-AS
in O
NY O
, O
if O
you O
don O
' O
t O
mind O
a O
wait B-AS
. O

I O
' O
m O
not O
a O
drinker O
, O
and O
I O
find O
that O
the O
waiters O
usually O
blow O
us O
off O
and O
ignore O
us O
once O
we O
don O
' O
t O
spend O
a O
lot O
of O
money O
ordering O
wine B-AS
, O
and O
the O
water O
takes O
a O
while O
to O
get O
re O
- O
filled O
, O
but O
the O
food B-AS
is O
good O
enough O
that O
we O
return O
. O

No O
condiments B-AS
on O
table O
or O
offered O
, O
service O
average O
, O
smokey O
upon O
arrival O
as O
the O
kitchen B-AS
is O
fully O
exposed O
and O
the O
space B-AS
very O
tight O
. O

After O
finishing O
your O
meal B-AS
, O
you O
can O
drop O
by O
their O
natural O
food B-AS
market O
next O
door O
for O
organic O
all O
natural O
grocery O
. O

The O
waiters B-AS
didn O
' O
t O
clean O
it O
up O
until O
they O
brought O
our O
dessert B-AS
. O

In O
Short O
This O
restaurant O
, O
an O
offshoot O
of O
the O
celebrity O
- O
besieged O
East O
Hampton O
eatery O
of O
the O
same O
name O
, O
is O
enlivened O
by O
a O
copper O
- O
topped O
bar B-AS
, O
an O
on O
- O
display O
wood O
- O
burning O
oven O
and O
a O
royal O
blue B-AS
oceanic I-AS
mural O
running O
along O
its O
walls O
. O

Went O
with O
three O
people O
last O
saturday O
night O
- O
half O
way O
through O
our O
entrees B-AS
we O
tried O
to O
order O
a O
second O
bottle B-AS
of I-AS
wine I-AS
- O
both O
the O
hostess B-AS
and O
waitress B-AS
told O
us O
no O
, O
cause O
, O
ehh O
, O
the O
place B-AS
is O
very O
crowded O
this O
night O
guys O
. O

If O
you O
eat O
here O
, O
just O
keep O
in O
mind O
that O
the O
specials B-AS
are O
much O
higher O
than O
the O
regular O
menu B-AS
when O
ordering O
. O

The O
regular O
entrees B-AS
and O
desserts B-AS
here O
are O
excellent O
, O
with O
truly O
unusual O
sides B-AS
and O
garnishes O
that O
make O
for O
brilliant O
flavor B-AS
combinations O
with O
the O
central B-AS
meat I-AS
or O
fish B-AS
. O

True O
, O
the O
service B-AS
is O
hardly O
on O
par O
with O
the O
finer O
restaurants O
in O
NYC O
, O
but O
I O
go O
for O
the O
energy O
and O
the O
tasty O
tapas B-AS
- I-AS
like I-AS
seafood I-AS
treats I-AS
that O
are O
perfect O
with O
beer B-AS
or O
sake B-AS
. O

There O
is O
no O
service B-AS
at O
this O
bar B-AS
, O
which O
means O
no O
drinks B-AS
or O
food O
- O
- O
ultimately O
leading O
to O
a O
very O
frustrating O
night O
out O
, O
and O
you O
end O
up O
kicking O
yourself O
for O
not O
leaving O
an O
hour O
earlier O
. O

Hostess B-AS
finally O
brought O
it O
, O
saying O
if O
we O
wanted O
dessert B-AS
, O
we O
could O
move O
to O
another O
table O
. O

The O
bill B-AS
was O
surprisingly O
inexpensive O
considering O
we O
each O
had O
appetizers B-AS
, O
an O
entree O
, O
dessert B-AS
and O
drinks O
( O
alcoholic B-AS
and O
non O
) O
we O
also O
had O
3 O
rounds O
of O
shots O
for O
the O
entire O
table B-AS
. O

You O
get O
plenty O
of O
food B-AS
for O
the O
price B-AS
, O
enough O
leftovers O
for O
lunch B-AS
and O
they O
actually O
serve O
garlic O
chicken O
with O
lots O
of O
chicken O
and O
chinese O
vegetables O
. O

We O
waited O
forever O
for O
our O
orders O
, O
our O
drinks B-AS
came O
out O
AFTER O
our O
food O
, O
we O
never O
got O
refills O
on O
water B-AS
, O
we O
had O
to O
ask O
like O
three O
times O
for O
extra O
dressing B-AS
, O
and O
our O
waiter B-AS
was O
rude O
. O

I O
am O
not O
sure O
if O
this O
was O
just O
an O
off O
night O
or O
what O
, O
our O
waiter B-AS
forgot O
wine B-AS
, O
brought O
us O
desert B-AS
menus I-AS
before O
dinner O
came O
, O
then O
brought O
us O
the O
wrong O
dinner O
. O

From O
the O
opera O
playing O
in O
the O
background B-AS
, O
to O
Emilio O
, O
the O
owner B-AS
wishing O
everyone O
a O
good O
meal B-AS
, O
this O
should O
be O
the O
highest O
rated O
Italian O
restaurant O
in O
the O
city O
. O

who O
seemed O
honestly O
offended O
that O
we O
asked O
why O
our O
table B-AS
was O
45 O
minutes O
late O
; O
a O
cold O
cafeteria B-AS
room I-AS
that O
was O
clearly O
designed O
to O
intimidate O
; O
and O
haute O
chinese B-AS
food I-AS
that O
was O
over O
- O
salted O
to O
make O
up O
for O
the O
lack O
of O
flavor B-AS
. O

After O
our O
initial O
order O
, O
the O
waitress B-AS
wasn O
' O
t O
very O
attentive O
( O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
15 O
minutes O
at O
a O
time O
to O
get O
her O
attention O
to O
refill O
drinks B-AS
, O
order O
desert B-AS
, O
etc O
) O
. O

Main O
courses O
include O
a O
list O
of O
housemade O
pastas O
, O
a O
daily B-AS
risotto I-AS
special I-AS
( O
if O
you O
' O
re O
lucky O
, O
you O
' O
ll O
arrive O
on O
wild B-AS
mushroom I-AS
day I-AS
) O
, O
plus O
a O
handful O
of O
fish O
and O
meat B-AS
dishes I-AS
. O

our O
waitress B-AS
( O
who O
was O
ok O
) O
disappeared O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
our O
dinner B-AS
, O
leaving O
us O
to O
an O
obnoxious O
amateur O
( O
must O
answer O
the O
phones O
or O
something O
) O
who O
could O
not O
answer O
our O
questions O
and O
treated O
us O
extremely O
rudely O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
I O
think O
our O
service B-AS
person O
was O
miffed O
that O
we O
couldn O
' O
t O
order O
much O
for O
apps O
or O
drinks B-AS
since O
we O
had O
already O
started O
at O
the O
bar B-AS

I O

cloudy O

constantly O

Before O

it O
' O

harder O
for O
a O
relatively O
untrained O
palate O
to O
appreciate O
the O
difference O
between O

than O
to O
savor O

the O

The O

beautiful O
and O
romantic O
place O
to O

with O

The O

Palm O

. O

Got O
a O

, O
and O
had O
some O
weird O
fill O
- O
out O
order O
form O
for O
a O
hard O
to O
understand O
menu B-AS
. O

The O
interior B-AS
is O
understated O
making O
it O
special O
enough O
to O
take O
a O
date O
but O
easy O
enough O
to O
stop O
in O
anytime O
for O
dinner B-AS
or O
snack B-AS
. O

We O
get O
treated O
very O
well O
and O
before O

immediately O
when O

for O

When O
my O

I O
visited O
, O
we O
were O
hearded O
in O
and O
out O
of O
the O
restaurant O
like O

not O
once O
did O
our O
waiter O
ask O
how O
are O
meal B-AS
was O
, O
and O
the O
waitress B-AS
mixed O
up O
our O
steaks O

Any O
of O

the O

finish O
to O
a O
picnic O
lunch B-AS
in O
the O

or O
a O
Romantic O
Dinner B-AS
at O

The O
service B-AS
was O
terrible O
- O
our O
waiter B-AS
was O
unable O
to O
make O
any O
recommendations O
, O
mumbled O
the O
special O
and O
failed O
to O
check O
back O
during O
the O
course O
of O
our O
meal B-AS
. O

I O

I O
expected O

SO O
I O
ASKED O
, O
TO O
SPEAK O
TO O
THE O
MANAGER B-AS

AND O
ONE O
OF O
THE O
OWNER B-AS
WHO O
MANAGES O
THE O
PLACE O
CAME O
TO O
MY O
TABLE O
, O
TOLD O
ME O
THAT O
THE O
CEVICHE B-AS
WAS O
FRESH O
. O

When O
we O
got O
there O
, O
the O
wait B-AS
was O
just O
as O
everyone O
here O
has O
described O
, O
Domenico O
' O
s O
process O
was O
just O
as O
described O
, O
but O
the O
pizza B-AS
? O

The O
place B-AS
got O
really O
crowded O
around O
8ish O
when O
I O
went O
right O
before O
Christmas O
so O
reservations B-AS
might O
be O
necessary O
. O

The O
Food O
This O
Cajun B-AS
- I-AS
Italian I-AS
menu I-AS
is O
lengthier O
than O
its O
Manhattan O
counterparts O
- O
- O
here O
, O
adventuresome O
diners B-AS
can O
still O
design O
their O
own O
pies O
, O
but O
they O
can O
also O
feast O
on O
oversized O
plates B-AS
of O
peel O
- O
and O
- O
eat O
old O
bay O
shrimp O
and O
cajun B-AS
spaghetti I-AS
with I-AS
meatballs I-AS
enlivened I-AS
with O
andouille O
sausage O
. O

Great O
tasting O
meat B-AS
, O
intimate O
if O
slightly O
noisy O
ambience O
and O
the O
service B-AS
is O
slightly O
less O
attentive O
than O
it O
could O
be O
but O
is O
done O
with O
charm O
. O

For O
an O
entree B-AS
, O
I O
tried O
the O
Ravioli B-AS
, O
cooked O
to O
perfection O
and O
stuffed O
with O
eggplant O
, O
ricotta B-AS
, O
and O
chicken B-AS
and O
served O
in O
an O
suculent O
sage O
butter O
sauce O
. O

We O
are O
30 O
plus O
year O
olds O
, O
very O
gainfully O
employed O
, O
were O
not O
being O
loud O
or O
obnoxious O
, O
there O
were O
other O
diners O
around O
us O
as O
well O
as O
a O
bunch O
of O
people O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
and O
nobody O
seemed O
to O
have O
a O
problem O
with O
us O
except O
for O
this O
manager B-AS
. O

You O
' O
ll O
have O
to O
wait O
for O
a O
long O
time O
if O
you O
' O
re O
not O
in O
with O
the O
management B-AS
or O
Fernando O
, O
but O
it O
' O
s O
worth O
it O
, O
have O
some O
campari O
and O
cinzano O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
! O

The O
sauce B-AS
is O
filled O
with O
spices B-AS
, O
including O
fresh O
garlic B-AS
and I-AS
basil I-AS
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
got O
aggravated O
when O
we O
explained O
how O
we O
wanted O
our O
entrees B-AS
prepared O
. O

What O
I O
thought O
was O
a O
rip O
off O
was O
, O
when O
we O
were O
ordering O
, O
the O
waiter B-AS
told O
us O
there O
was O
a O
minimum O
of O
food B-AS
we O
can O
purchase O
. O

Service O
only O
so O
- O
so O
- O
- O
I O
saw O
a O
lot O
of O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
standing O
around O
, O
and O
at O
the O
busiest O
moment O
, O
I O
watched O
waiter O
stroll O
through O
the O
dining B-AS
room I-AS
with O
two O
plates O
as O
if O
he O
had O
all O
the O
time O
in O
the O
world O
. O

My O
Moon O
spent O
all O
their O
money B-AS
on O
an O
architect O
/ O
interior O
designer O
and O
forgot O
about O
the O
chef B-AS
. O

Now O
, O
I O
expressed O
my O
surprise O
and O
then O
the O
bartender O
and O
manager B-AS
chimed O
in O
with O
a O
simpleton O
' O
s O
remark O
sir O
, O
with O
restaurants O
at O
this O
time O
, O
reservations B-AS
start O
coming O
in O
. O

Their O
mixed B-AS
drinks I-AS
weren O
' O
t O
so O
good O
, O
but O
they O
have O
nice O
selection B-AS
of I-AS
wines I-AS
. O

sam O
adams O
on O

, O
french B-AS
fries I-AS
served I-AS
out O
of O
a O
brown O
paper O
bag O
and O
a O
burger B-AS
cooked O
perfectly O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
good O
but O
took O
long O
and O
the O
drinks B-AS
she O
recommended O
to O
us O
were O
too O
strong O
. O

be O
prepared O
for O
a O
long O
wait B-AS
at O
dinner B-AS
. O

My O
friend O
and O
I O
went O
out O
for O
a O
cigarette O
, O
and O
when O
we O
returned O
, O
our O
table O
had O
been O
given O
to O
another O
party O
- O
even O
though O
our O
drinks B-AS
and O
unpaid O
bill B-AS
were O
still O
on O
the O
table O
. O

finally O
they O
wanted O
to O
take O
our O
app O
order O
before O
taking O
our O
wine B-AS
order O
, O
seemed O
like O
the O
waiter B-AS
couldnt O
handle O
it O
all O
at O
once O
. O

The O
food B-AS
, O
service B-AS
, O
and O
atmosphere B-AS
are O
all O
pretty O
good O
, O
but O
a O
little O
pricy O
, O
coming O
to O
about O
40 O
$ O
a O
person O
if O
you O
order O
1 O
drink B-AS
and O
1 O
appetizer B-AS
each I-AS
. O

But O
the O
best O
offerings O
are O
the O
a O
la B-AS
carte I-AS
grilled I-AS
items I-AS
, O
such O
as O
the O
chicken B-AS
with I-AS
scallion I-AS

and O
asparagus B-AS
with I-AS
bacon I-AS
rolls I-AS
. O

The O
portions B-AS

entrees B-AS
did O
make O
up O
for O
it O
. O

the O
prices B-AS
are O
right O
and O
i O
strongly O
recommend O
this O
place O
for O
any O
time O
of O
day O
: O
early O
breakfast B-AS
or O
late O
night O
snack B-AS
. O

Well O

Dishes B-AS

. O

For O
spending O
over O
$ O
100 O
per O
person O
for O
dinner B-AS
, O
i O
would O
think O
that O
the O
waiter B-AS
would O
put O
my O
plate O
of O
food B-AS
down O
for O
me O
instead O
of O
handing O
me O
my O
dish O
. O

The O
good O
service B-AS
started O
from O
the O
moment O
we O
walked O
in O
the O
front O
door B-AS
. O

We O
get O
our O
beers B-AS
and O
then O
are O
told O
from O
a O
confuzed O
waitress B-AS
that O
she O
realized O
that O
she O
can O
' O
t O
give O
us O
the O
happy O
hour O
drink O
prices O
if O
we O
are O
not O
sitting O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
was O
pleasant O
and O
I O
thought O
how O
bad O
could O
someone O
screw O
up O
basic O
Italian B-AS
food I-AS
? O

They O
spoon O
the O
FAT B-AS

were O
flawless O
( O

was O
succulent O

fun O
having O
the O
branzino B-AS
fileted I-AS
at O
the O
table O
) O
, O
and O
the O
tiramisu B-AS
. O

Hostess B-AS
continued O
to O
ask O
us O
if O
everything O
was O
okay O
, O
and O
then O
did O
nothing O
when O
we O
gave O
her O
specific O
actions O
( O
how O
about O
some O
water O
or O
coffee B-AS
served I-AS
in O
paper O
cups O
) O

As O
expected O

list I-AS
is O
as O
thoughtful O
as O
the O

the O
staff B-AS
has O
earned O
my O
trust O
with O
their O
bullet O

proof O

I O
have O
yet O
to O
be O
disappointed O
from O
their O

I O
' O

, O
and O
I O
can O
honestly O
say O
that O
I O
' O
ve O
finally O
found O

eating O
at O
a O
reasonable O

an O
hour O
, O
being O
seated O
when O
we O
reminded O
the O
hostess B-AS
that O
we O
were O
still O
waiting O
. O

Went O
the O
next O
day B-AS
for O
lunch O
- O
menu B-AS
too O
pricey O
for O
lunch O
and O
the O
waiter B-AS
was O
the O
WORST O
! O
! O

The O
only O
problem O
we O
had O
was O
with O
an O
incompetent O
waitress B-AS
and O
floor B-AS
manager I-AS
which O
slowed O
down O
our O
food B-AS
and O
seating O
. O

One O
oversight O
: O
the O
gf O
wanted O
tea O
to O
go O
along O
with O
the O
plate B-AS
of O
yummies O
they O
gave O
me O
, O
but O
the O
server B-AS
forgot O
to O
bring O
it O
since O
we O
took O
our O
time O
to O
finish O
the O
wine B-AS
. O

The O
Patroon B-AS
burger I-AS
- O
- O
Angus O
beef O
topped O
with O
a B-AS
roasted I-AS
tomato I-AS
- O
- O
is O
simple O
, O
yet O
able O
to O
stand O
on O
its O
own O
against O
any O
fully O
loaded O
competitor O
. O

Good O
location B-AS
, O
but O
tourist O
- O
y O
and O
poor O
quality O
food B-AS
. O

I O
realize O
that O
this O
place O
has O
a O
huge O
menu B-AS
and O
, O
therefore O
, O
will O
have O
some O
not O
- O
so O
- O
good O
things O
, O
but O
it O
' O
s O
the O
rudeness O
of O
the O
service B-AS
that O
gets O
to O
me O
. O

The O
chefs B-AS
and O
staff B-AS
are O
welcoming O
and O
happy O
to O
make O
substitutions O
or O
tune O
the O
spice B-AS
up O
or O
down O
to O
your O
requests O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
at O
best O
distracted O
, O
at O
worst O
disdainful O
, O
even O
though O
we O
came O
early O
with O
a O
reservation B-AS
and O
are O
not O
food O
novices O
. O

as O
written O
below O
, O
the O
drinks B-AS
were O
watered O
down O
, O
and O
they O
didn O
' O
t O
have O
the O
ginger O
martini O
available O
nor O
all O
of O
the O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
. O

great O
food B-AS
, O
even O
better O
price B-AS
, O
they O
also O
have O
a O
dj B-AS
spinning O
great O
music B-AS
, O
definitely O
a O
must O
try O
. O

No O
matter O
what O
you O
order O
, O
you O
' O
re O
almost O
certain O
to O
get O
so O
much O
food B-AS
you O
' O
ll O
be O
leaving O
with O
a O
doggie O
bag B-AS
. O

Good O
wines B-AS
under O
$ O
100 O
are O
included O
in O
the O
predominantly O
French B-AS
list I-AS
, O
but O
take O
some O
ferreting O
out O
to O
find O
. O

Since O
we O
already O
have O
our O
drinks B-AS
there O
is O
no O
choice O
, O
so O
we O
are O
forced O
to O
pay O
full O
price B-AS
. O

I O
think O
the O
person O
who O
says O
it O
has O
a O
wierd O
taste B-AS
must O
have O
had O
very O
bad O
luck O
because O
I O
think O
this O
is O
the O
most O
authentic O
thai O
I O
' O
ve O
had O
in O
NYC O
( O
and O
I O
' O
m O
comparing O
it O
to O
food B-AS
in O
Thailand O
) O
. O

If O
the O
staff B-AS
actually O
got O
it O
together O
and O
showed O
some O
customer O
service B-AS
this O
place O
would O
be O
good O
. O

The O
food O
was O
not O
good O
at O
all O
, O
starting O
with O
the O
green B-AS
salad I-AS
, O
and O
the O
entrees O
( O
garlic O
chicken O
, O
chicken O
extreme O
) O
were O
chicken O
doused O
in O
oily O
sauce B-AS
. O

Waitress B-AS
forgot O
drinks B-AS
, O
and O
watched O
us O
begin O
our O
dinner B-AS
without O
even O
water O
, O
strange O
. O

After O
paying O
for O
our O
meal B-AS
, O
we O
left O
some O
feedback O
with O
the O
manager B-AS
( O
a O
chap O
named O
J O
. O

Order O
the O
porterhouse O
and O
they O
put O
it O
between O
you O
and O
you O
kind O
of O
eat B-AS
family O
style B-AS
at O
a O
wooden O
table B-AS
. O

In O
any O
case O
, O
the O
food B-AS
was O
quite O
yummy O
and O
on O
monday O
nights O
, O
they O
have O
a O
prix B-AS
fixe O
$ O
25 O
dinner B-AS
which O
is O
definitely O
a O
deal O
. O

Someone O
should O
tell O
these O
people O
that O
high O
prices B-AS
on O
the O
menu B-AS
does O
not O
make O
your O
restaurant O
better O
. O

A O
full O
bar B-AS
and O
a O
dozen O
different O
margaritas B-AS
attract O
a O
happy O
hour O
crowd O
, O
and O
a O
tortilla O
machine O
is O
often O
surrounded O
by O
children O
watching O
the O
dough O
- O
to O
- O
tortilla O
transformation B-AS
. O

When O
we O
were O
finally O
seated O
about O
half O
an O
hour O
after O
my O
reservation B-AS
, O
the O
waitress B-AS
took O
her O
time O
taking O
our O
order O
. O

If O
you O
' O
re O
dining B-AS
solo O
, O
you O
will O
feel O
completely O
at O
ease O
in O
the O
cozy O
environs B-AS
; O
in O
fact O
, O
you O
' O
re O
likely O
to O
see O
at O
least O
one O
other O
solo O
diner B-AS
hunched O
over O
a O
book O
, O
sipping O
a O
glass O
of O
Chianti O
. O

( O
and O
don O
' O
t O
miss O
the O
olive B-AS
oil I-AS
when O
dining B-AS
in O
- O
not O
sure O
what O
they O
put O
in O
it O
, O
but O
it O
is O
de O
- O
licious O
! O

I O
ordered O
dessert B-AS
and O
it O
was O
they O
gave O
me O
the O
wrong O
flavor B-AS
of O
ice O
cream O
. O

Nice O
decor O
and O
an O
extensive O
menu B-AS
lured O
me O
in O
, O
but O
the O
horrible O
service O
and O
rude O
staff B-AS
drove O
me O
out O
. O

Meaning O
, O
I O
ordered O
Lobster B-AS
Tails I-AS
as O
an O
entree B-AS
( O
The O
Tails O
were O
delicious O
) O
and O
along O
with O
my O
Tails O
came O
Spinach B-AS
with I-AS
beans I-AS
and I-AS
fried I-AS
potatoes I-AS
that O
were O
close O
to O
potato B-AS
steak I-AS
fries I-AS
. O

I O
was O
surprise O
with O
the O
Champagne B-AS
toast I-AS
from O
the O
concierge O
who O
booked O
our O
dinner B-AS
. O

My O
girlfriend O
asked O
the O
bartender B-AS
what O
kind O
of O
wine B-AS
they O
had O
and O
since O
she O
couldn O
' O
t O
hear O
she O
leaned O
on O
the O
bar O
to O
get O
closer O
to O
him O
and O
he O
made O
a O
face O
and O
told O
her O
not O
to O
get O
near O
him O
. O

The O
rice B-AS
that O
we O
were O
served O
for O
dinner B-AS
was O
dry O
and O
hard O
, O
obviously O
left O
over O
from O
lunch O
. O

the O
food B-AS
was O
excellent O
, O
although O
they O
didn O
' O
t O
have O
any O
dishes B-AS
with O
meat O
, O
and O
the O
soy B-AS
replacements O
definitely O
were O
not O
a O
replacement O
for O
meat O
. O

ten O
minutes O
after O
we O
ordered O
the O
waitress O
came O
to O
our O
table B-AS
and O
told O
us O
we O
had O
ordered O
complicated O
entrees B-AS
and O
we O
would O
be O
waiting O
for O
45 O
minutes O
. O

The O
margaritas O
were O
mediocre O
, O
but O
it O
did O
not O
make O
up O
for O
the O
muzak O
they O
played O
in O
the O
resturant O
nor O
the O
bad O
food O
and O
drink B-AS
they O
served B-AS
. O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
was O
wonderful O
, O
however O
the O
service B-AS
and O
food B-AS
were O
not O
. O

I O
had O
a O
tasty O
Caesar B-AS
salad I-AS
for O
an O
appetizer B-AS
and O
ordered O
the O
10 O
oz B-AS
Fillet I-AS
Mignon I-AS
medium O
rare O
. O

Bartenders B-AS
look O
like O
model O
wannabes O
and O
threw O
out O
my O
friend O
' O
s O
beer B-AS
before O
he O
was O
finished O
( O
about O
1 O
/ O
4 O
left O
) O
. O

They O
did O
not O
have O
mayonnaise B-AS
, O
forgot O
our O
toast B-AS
, O
left O
out O
ingredients B-AS
( O
ie O
cheese B-AS
in O
an O
omelet B-AS
) O
, O
below O
hot O
temperatures O
and O
the O
bacon B-AS
was O
so O
over O
cooked O
it O
crumbled O
on O
the O
plate O
when O
you O
touched O
it O
. O

The O
place B-AS
is O
packed O
, O
they O
don O
' O
t O
take O
reservations B-AS
and O
waited O
almost O
2 O
hours O
. O

When O
it O
came O
time O
to O
get O
the O
check B-AS
, O
they O
couldn O
' O
t O
seem O
to O
determine O
which O
of O
the O
servers B-AS
had O
it O
. O

I O
though O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
get O
such O
appetizers B-AS
as O
a O
seafood O
salad O
or O
a O
seafood O
soup O
for O
about O
$ O
3 O
, O
but O
the O
taste B-AS
and O
portions B-AS
won O
' O
t O
let O
you O
have O
any O
doubts O
. O

An O
Egg O
like O
custard O
appetizer O
, O
a O
platter B-AS
of O
different O
kinds O
of O
rolls B-AS
made O
from O
: O
Lobster O
, O
Eel B-AS
, O
Sword O
Fish O
, O
Trout B-AS
, O
Blue O
Fin O
Tuna O
, O
Horse O
Mackerel O
, O
and O
Salmon O
Roe O
. O

Get O
a O
bottle B-AS
of I-AS
wine I-AS
, O
and O
eat O
what O
your O
heart O
has O
been O
desiring O
because O
all O
the O
things O
you O
would O
love O
to O
be O
on O
one O
menu B-AS
- O
- O
are O
! O

Granted O
, O
it O
' O
s O
loud O
and O
sometimes O
obnoxious O
and O
it O
' O
s O
such O
a O
pain O
to O
get O
seats B-AS
for O
, O
but O
the O
the O
food B-AS
is O
great O
. O

Unfortunately O
the O
food B-AS
and O
the O
service O
don O
' O
t O
live O
up O
to O
the O
spectacular O
setting B-AS
. O

The O
place B-AS
has O
a O
sort O
of O
trendy O
pseudo O
- O
asian O
decor B-AS
that O
seems O
perfectly O
casual O
or O
romantic O
. O

The O
staff B-AS
was O
great O
- O
and O
all O
guests O
are O
seated O
by O
the O
owners B-AS
. O

With O
dessert B-AS
, O
the O
pre B-AS
- I-AS
theater I-AS
is O
a O
great O
deal O
/ O
meal O
. O

Smallish O
menu B-AS
, O
but O
more O
than O
adequate O
, O
and O
not O
that O
heavy O
on O
sauces B-AS
which O
is O
so O
typical O
of O
italian O
restaurants O
. O

This O
place O
is O
so O
very O
nearly O
achieving O
, O
but O
in O
the O
mean O
time O
, O
my O
advice O
- O
eat O
early O
elsewhere O
, O
then O
take O
your O
seat O
, O
order O
a O
bottle B-AS
of I-AS
wine I-AS
and O
enjoy O
the O
performance O
and O
the O
ambience B-AS
. O

The O
Scene B-AS
You O
' O
ll O
have O
to O
knock O
to O
enter O
this O
hidden O
dining B-AS
room I-AS
, O
a O
luxe O
windowless O
space B-AS
featuring O
four O
wall O
- O
sized O
murals O
depicting O
famous O
landmarks O
throughout O
the O
seasons O
, O
as O
well O
as O
a O
handful O
of O
finery O
- O
laden O
tables B-AS
. O

When O
the O
manager B-AS
came O
over O
, O
he O
accused O
my O
friend O
of O
offending O
the O
chef B-AS
and O
continued O
to O
argue O
with O
her O
about O
the O
dish B-AS
. O

For O
around O
$ O
50 O
per O
person O
for O
brunch B-AS
, O
it O
was O
a O
great O
value O
and O
the O
food B-AS
really O
was O
fantastic O
. O

After O
waiting O
more O
than O
15 O
minutes O
for O
our O
order O
to O
be O
taken O
and O
then O
having O
the O
waitress B-AS
not O
know O
how O
to O
make O
certain O
drinks B-AS
, O
our O
party O
of O
7 O
was O
obviously O
dissatisified O
. O

Ones O
experience B-AS
is O
truly O
dampened O
by O
having O
to O
trundle O
up O
lifts O
and O
escalators O
, O
further O
on O
arrival O
at O
the O
restaurant O
we O
found O
the O
actual B-AS
dining I-AS
room I-AS
to O
be O
slightly O
sterile O
and O
lacking O
in O
atmosphere B-AS
. O

The O
worst O
service B-AS
I O
have O
ever O
had O
- O
entered O
the O
restaurant O
and O
waited O
at O
the O
door O
for O
5 O
minutes O
before O
deciding O
to O
push O
our O
way O
past O
the O
extremely O
small O
bar B-AS
to O
find O
a O
waitress B-AS
. O

The O
waitress B-AS
/ I-AS
hostess I-AS
seemed O
a O
bit O
sad O
when O
we O
told O
her O
we O
weren O
' O
t O
ordering O
dessert B-AS
( O
those O
arepas O
are O
deceptively O
filling O
! O

The O
food B-AS
was O
ok O
, O
good O
bread B-AS
. O

I O
am O
a O
martini B-AS
guy I-AS
- O
vodka O
, O
not O
gin O
- O
and O
their O
classic O
martini B-AS
with I-AS
blue I-AS
cheese I-AS
olives I-AS
is O
pretty O
damn O
near O
definitive O
. O

While O
I O
would O
agree O
with O
the O
initial O
review O
that O
Asia O
de O
Cuba O
isn O
' O
t O
really O
Asian O
or O
Cuban O
in O
its O
decor B-AS
, O
the O
food B-AS
was O
a O
nice O
fusion O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
you O
can O
' O
t O
really O
say O
you O
' O
ve O
arrived O
in O
this O
town O
until O
you O
' O
ve O
scored O
a O
table B-AS
here O
and O
made O
the O
pilgrimage O
to O
east O
Harlem O
for O
luscious O
pastas B-AS
and O
chicken B-AS
in I-AS
vinegar I-AS
and O
lemon B-AS
. O

The O
waitstaff B-AS
was O
helpful O
but O
watch O
out O
, O
after O
you O
pay O
your O
hefty O
bill B-AS
managment O
will O
ask O
you O
to O
leave O
if O
they O
think O
you O
' O
ve O
lingered O
too O
long O
. O

The O
Setting B-AS
The O
exposed O
brick O
and O
tangerine O
walls O
, O
flickering O
candles B-AS
and O
tiny O
bar B-AS
cast O
a O
formal O
mood O
across O
this O
cozy O
Park O
Slope O
trattoria O
, O
but O
the O
high O
ceiling B-AS
fans O
and O
two O
glass O
walls O
( O
left O
open O
in O
warm O
weather O
) O
add O
a O
casual O
breeziness B-AS
. O

We O
made O
reservations B-AS
for O
6pm O
on O
Friday O
and O
it O
was O
not O
necessary O
BUT O
the O
place B-AS
got O
packed O
really O
quick O
around O
7 O
- O
8pm O
. O

Other O
than O
its O
impossible O
reservation B-AS
( O
no O
matter O
how O
many O
months O
you O
call O
in O
advance O
, O
the O
only O
available O
time O
slots O
for O
dinner B-AS
on O
a O
Saturday O
are O
always O
4 O
: O
45 O
or O
9 O
: O
45 O
) O
, O
Peter O
Luger O
is O
worth O
the O
drive O
over O
to O
Brooklyn O
. O

The O
pooris B-AS
were O
miniscule O
, O
about O
2 O
bites O
each O
; O
they O
serve O
4 O
of O
those O
as O
a O
dinner B-AS
for O
$ O
25 O
! O

Highly O
suggest O
you O
sit O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
for O
added O
atmosphere B-AS
and O
generally O
friendly O
people O
. O

As O
a O
lover O
of O
everything O
humus B-AS
and O
cucumber B-AS
, O
there O
is O
no O
other O
restaurant O
in O
the O
city O
that O
compares O
to O
Mogador O
' O
s O
appetizers B-AS
. O

A O
great O
coal O
fired O
crust B-AS
provides O
a O
backyard B-AS
BBQ I-AS
taste I-AS
. O

Although O
the O
food B-AS
was O
great O
, O
the O
service B-AS
was O
so O
bad O
that O
I O
can O
' O
t O
see O
myself O
ever O
returning O
. O

Tried O
to O
get O
a O
table B-AS
during O
restaurant O
week O
but O
there O
was O
an O
over O
an O
hour O
wait B-AS
. O

The O
fresh O
mozzerella B-AS
appetizer I-AS
had O
to O
be O
the O
runniest O
mozz O
I O
have O
ever O
had O
, O
and O
the O
accompanying B-AS
tomato I-AS
was O
so O
over O
- O
salted O
I O
could O
barely O
eat O
it O
. O

The O
cultured B-AS
wait I-AS
staff I-AS
were O
accommodating O
and O
helped O
explain O
and O
pronounce O
the O
items O
off O
the O
menu B-AS
. O

A O
cocky O
, O
arrogant O
and O
shockingly O
condescending O
manager B-AS
( O
all O
of O
22 O
years O
- O
old O
) O
then O
told O
us O
we O
should O
leave O
the O
restaurant O
if O
we O
wouldn O
' O
t O
move O
to O
the O
bar B-AS
. O

When O
I O
saw O
it O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
I O
didn O
' O
t O
beleive O
it O
and O
was O
not O
expecting O
the O
real O
thing B-AS
. O

You O
can O
undoubtedly O
get O
better O
food B-AS
and O
service O
for O
the O
price B-AS
at O
other O
places O
, O
but O
certainly O
not O
with O
those O
views O
! O

When O
I O
complained O
regarding O
the O
poor O
tiramisu B-AS
, O
the O
waitress B-AS
made O
a O
flip O
comment O
regarding O
the O
fact O
that O
I O
shouldn O
' O
t O
order O
an O
italian O
dessert B-AS
in O
an O
irish O
restaurant O
. O

We O
held O
a O
birthday O
dinner B-AS
for O
my O
friend O
and O
were O
very O
impressed O
w O
/ O
both O
food B-AS
and O
service B-AS
. O

My O
favorite O
dishes B-AS
all O
involved O
squash B-AS
of O
some O
kind O
, O
which O
i O
would O
not O
expect O
to O
love O
. O

The O
restaurant O
appears O
clean O
and O
the O
food O
was O
fine O
until O
my O
dining B-AS
partner O
discovered O
pieces O
of O
chicken B-AS
about O
half O
way O
through O
her O
vegetarian O
dish O
. O

The O
waitresses B-AS
and O
the O
diners B-AS
have O
to O
scream O
at O
one O
another O
to O
give O
an O
order O
. O

We O
a O
menu O
that O
rearely O
changes O
, O
e O
xcept O
for O
one O
or O
two O
specials O
, O
the O
quality B-AS
and O
care B-AS
they O
put O
in O
thier O
food B-AS
in O
evident O
. O

This O
Raku O
provided O
fresh O
and O
sumptuous O
sushi B-AS
, O
sashimi B-AS
, O
and O
deliciously O
prepared O
cooked O
entrees B-AS
, O
which O
did O
much O
to O
alleviate O
my O
jitters O
about O
fishing O
( O
or O
dining B-AS
, O
as O
it O
were O
) O
in O
unfamiliar O
waters O
. O

When O
we O
sat O
, O
our O
waiter B-AS
came O
over O
immediately O
and O
recommended O
the O
snapper B-AS
and O
the O
pho B-AS
- O
- O
some O
of O
the O
tastiest O
I O
' O
ve O
had O
, O
and O
I O
went O
to O
Tu O
Lan O
3x O
a O
week O
in O
San O
Francisco O
. O

Had O
an O
OK O
dinner B-AS
that O
was O
made O
better O
by O
the O
attention O
the O
owners B-AS
pay O
to O
the O
patrons O
. O

I O
must O
start O
by O
stating O
plainly O
that O
I O
love O
Jeollado O
, O
but O
it O
is O
loud O
, O
the O
service B-AS
is O
bad O
, O
but O
the O
rolls B-AS
are O
great O
and O
it O
is O
the O
best O
deal O
( O
CHEAP O
) O
in O
town O
. O

We O
sat O
near O
the O
sluggish O
, O
hot O
and O
very O
loud O
kitchen B-AS
and O
the O
service O
area O
was O
not O
wiped O
down O
once O
during O
the O
entire O
time B-AS
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
the O
food B-AS
is O
awful O
, O
the O
staff B-AS
really O
doesnt O
care O
about O
you O
, O
and O
the O
frozen B-AS
hot I-AS
chocolate I-AS
is O
just O
a O
chocolate B-AS
milkshake I-AS
( O
it O
wasnt O
all O
that O
great O
) O
I O
went O
before O
lunch B-AS
on O
a O
Thursday O
and O
it O
took O
me O
2 O
hours O
to O
get O
in O
. O

There O
might O
be O
a O
wait O
for O
brunch B-AS
or O
even O
for O
dinner B-AS
, O
but O
the O
quality B-AS
of I-AS
the I-AS
food I-AS
is O
always O
worth O
the O
wait O
. O

The O
service B-AS
, O
which O
was O
horrendous O
- O
they O
charged O
us O
for O
two O
appetizers B-AS
when O
we O
asked O
to O
split O
one O
( O
when O
we O
brought O
it O
up O
, O
he O
insisted O
that O
the O
appetizer O
really O
did O
only O
consist O
of O
2 O
sliced O
tomatoes O
and O
1 O
slice B-AS
of I-AS
cheese I-AS
) O
. O

It O
was O
a O
crowded O
Wednesday O
night O
but O
we O
were O
seated O
near O
the O
kitchen O
right O
away O
, O
talked O
to O
all O
of O
the O
staff B-AS
who O
were O
friendly O
and O
made O
the O
evening O
special B-AS
for O
my O
date O
and O
I O
. O

The O
$ O
9 O
glass B-AS
of I-AS
wine I-AS
which O
the O
waitress B-AS
called O
good O
was O
like O
grape B-AS
juice I-AS
with O
alcohol B-AS
and O
no O
sugar B-AS
. O

The O
waitresses B-AS
are O
at O
your O
table O
filling O
your O
water B-AS
or O
oil B-AS
before O
your O
last O
sip O
or O
dip O
. O

I O
managed O
to O
get O
the O
last O
reservation B-AS
at O
11 O
: O
15pm O
during O
the O
week O
, O
and O
, O
upon O
entering O
the O
restaurant O
, O
my O
boyfriend O
and O
I O
were O
seated O
next O
to O
each O
other O
, O
hardly O
a O
romantic O
atmosphere B-AS
! O

The O
upside O
of O
the O
smallish O
portions B-AS
is O
that O
a O
good O
sake O
can O
do O
a O
better O
job O
working O
over O
one O
' O
s O
date O
, O
and O
you O
don O
' O
t O
leave O
the O
table B-AS
w O
/ O
a O
food B-AS
coma O
. O

Personally O
, O
I O
like O
my O
food B-AS
fresh O
, O
so O
you O
just O
have O
to O
tell O
the O
waiter B-AS
that O
you O
would O
like O
to O
order O
by O
ear O
. O

I O
and O
3 O
friends O
went O
there O
last O
night O
for O
dinner B-AS
and O
loved O
the O
food B-AS
, O
which O
I O
have O
to O
say O
was O
uniformly O
outstanding O
and O
some O
of O
the O
best O
I O
' O
ve O
had O
for O
under O
a O
zillion O
dollars O
in O
a O
long O
time O
. O

Then O
we O
were O
seated O
at O
a O
large O
booth B-AS
and O
it O
took O
the O
waiter B-AS
20 O
minutes O
to O
come O
back O
and O
take O
our O
order O
but O
I O
sort O
of O
expected O
that O
with O
a O
new O
restaurant O
. O

The O
mint O
love O
letters B-AS
and O
spaghettini O
primi B-AS
we O
ordered O
as O
entrees B-AS
were O
perfection O
. O

the O
waiter B-AS
was O
extremely O
helpful O
, O
basically O
we O
gave O
him O
carte B-AS
blanche O
to O
order O
small O
plates B-AS
for O
us O
that O
he O
thought O
we O
' O
d O
like O
. O

No O
doubt O
, O
the O
lobster B-AS
bisque I-AS
will O
knock O
your O
socks O
off O
, O
but O
you O
' O
d O
be O
cheating O
yourself O
if O
you O
didn O
' O
t O
try O
some O
of O
the O
other O
options O
, O
specifically O
the O
sausage B-AS
gumbo I-AS
and O
the O
veal B-AS
ghoulash O
really O
lit O
my O
fire O
. O

Their O
service B-AS
needs O
some O
work O
, O
but O
it O
is O
safe O
to O
say O
that O
you O
will O
enjoy O
the O
food B-AS
. O

I O
have O
worked O
in O
the O
restaurant O
industry O
for O
5 O
years O
, O
and O
so O
am O
understanding O
of O
things O
out O
of O
my O
server B-AS
' O
s O
control O
, O
and O
I O
have O
never O
experienced O
such O
poor O
service B-AS
! O

I O
had O
one O
of O
the O
worst O
service B-AS
experiences O
in O
memory O
having O
the O
prix O
fix O
brunch B-AS
there O
- O
- O
waving O
arms O
, O
calling O
, O
asking O
two O
or O
three O
times O
for O
everything O
from O
coffee O
to O
the O
check O
. O

I O
love O
deviled O
eggs O
, O
a O
BBQ B-AS
staple O
- O
but O
I O
' O
ll O
be O
damned O
if O
serving O
two O
eggs O
( O
four O
VERY O
small O
halves O
) O
qualifies O
as O
an O
appetizer B-AS
. O

Food B-AS
is O
decent O
but O
portions B-AS
are O
so O
tiny O
and O
the O
whole O
meal B-AS
is O
served B-AS
on O
huge O
plate O
which O
makes O
it O
look O
even O
more O
ridiculous O
. O

The O
Scene B-AS
The O
entrance O
leads O
into O
a O
dim O
, O
narrow O
bar B-AS
decorated O
with O
sake B-AS
bottles O
, O
exposed O
brick O
and O
a O
beautiful O
arched O
wooden O
ceiling B-AS
. O

Nothing O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
jumped O
out O
at O
me O
, O
but O
when O
we O
tasted O
the O
chicken O
and O
the O
pork B-AS
tenderloin I-AS
. O

Our O
waiter B-AS
fast O
to O
get O
our O
drinks B-AS
, O
aptz O
, O
and O
orders O
. O

And O
don O
' O
t O
forget O
to O
try O
the O
Korean B-AS
rice I-AS
wine I-AS
to O
go O
with O
your O
dinner B-AS
( O
Sansachun O
is O
one O
of O
my O
favorite O
) O
. O

I O
have O
tried O
to O
make O
reservations B-AS
, O
but O
both O
times O
, O
the O
hostess B-AS
didn O
' O
t O
have O
my O
name O
. O

We O
had O
to O
ask O
for O
the O
bill B-AS
twice O
, O
and O
our O
water B-AS
was O
refilled O
only O
when O
we O
asked O
for O
it O
. O

The O
salmon B-AS
carpaccio I-AS
was O
just O
bland O
lox B-AS
over O
a O
bed O
of O
unseasoned O
spinich O
, O
the O
NY O
strip O
steak B-AS
was O
not O
a O
good O
cut O
of O
meat B-AS
, O
the O
fish B-AS
special I-AS
, O
snapper O
, O
was O
tough O
and O
flavorless O
, O
and O
the O
key B-AS
lime I-AS
pie I-AS
for O
dessert B-AS
tasted O
like O
it O
was O
from O
a O
supermarket O
. O

Appetizers B-AS
were O
OK O
, O
steak B-AS
was O
not O
as O
good O
as O
what O
I O
would O
have O
prepared O
at O
home O
on O
the O
grill O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
been O
a O
few O
times O
for O
dinner B-AS
and O
dessert O
and O
the O
food B-AS
is O
always O
old O
- O
tasting O
and O
bland O
. O

words O
can O
' O
t O
even O
describe O
how O
delicious O
that O
dessert B-AS
was O
post O
a O
bottle O
of O
wine O
and O
pesto B-AS
ravioli I-AS
. O

Forget O
what O
it O
was O
called O
, O
but O
it O
had O
some O
kind O
of O
onion B-AS
puree I-AS
on O
top O
that O
ROCKED O
and O
the O
steak B-AS
was O
a O
grass O
- O
fed O
organic O
type O
and O
very O
tender O
. O

For O
example O
, O
the O
last O
time O
I O
was O
there O
the O
bartender B-AS
seemed O
visibly O
irritated O
that O
I O
would O
ask O
him O
for O
a O
drink B-AS
instead O
of O
the O
waitress B-AS
. O

We O
waited O
half O
an O
hour O
just O
to O
get O
menus B-AS
, O
and O
watched O
another O
table O
of O
10 O
people O
leave O
because O
they O
had O
been O
ignored O
by O
the O
( O
single O
) O
waiter B-AS
. O

The O
staff B-AS
were O
all O
partying O
with O
each O
other O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
, O
so O
even O
though O
we O
were O
the O
only O
ones O
there O
for O
food O
, O
it O
took O
15 O
minutes O
to O
get O
menus B-AS
. O

It O
is O
the O
only O
all O
Austrian O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
in O
the O
country O
and O
the O
waitress B-AS
gladly O
broke O
it O
down O
for O
me O
, O
so O
I O
could O
find O
just O
the O
right O
wine O
for O
my O
meal B-AS
. O

but O
no O
reservations B-AS
makes O
for O
a O
very O
long O
wait B-AS
, O
usually O
of O
an O
hour O
. O

I O
was O
shocked O
by O
the O
amount O
of O
butter O
used O
in O
the O
pork O
and O
lamb O
dishes O
- O
- O
the O
smell B-AS
of I-AS
butter I-AS
was O
literally O
wafting O
off O
the O
plate B-AS
! O

dining B-AS
with O
my O
mother O
this O
past O
Saturday O
must O
have O
signaled O
to O
the O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
that O
I O
wasn O
' O
t O
cool O
enough O
to O
merit O
their O
attention O
. O

The O
wait B-AS
for O
brunch B-AS
is O
kinda O
long O
( O
what O
can O
you O
say O
? O

The O
seafood B-AS
sausage I-AS
is O
ok O
, O
but O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
appetizers B-AS
outshine O
them O
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
handed O
us O
menus O
consisting O
of O
about O
7 O
entrees B-AS
, O
and O
after O
telling O
us O
the O
specials B-AS
, O
informed O
us O
that O
there O
was O
no O
chicken B-AS
. O

The O
Food B-AS
Pies I-AS
come O
in O
three O
sizes O
, O
from O
a O
petite O
five O
inches O
( O
perfect O
for O
the O
solo O
diner B-AS
) O
up O
to O
10 O
. O

best O
chicken B-AS
in O
queens B-AS
. O

The O
ambience B-AS
is O
extremely O
romantic O
, O
even O
if O
you O
get O
seated O
upstairs B-AS
. O

Just O
be O
sensible O
, O
if O
the O
wait B-AS
is O
45 O
minutes O
or O
longer O
- O
- O
just O
have O
sushi B-AS
there O
some O
other O
time O
, O
and O
eat O
something O
else O
that O
night O
. O

I O
don O
' O
t O
know O
why O
people O
complain O
about O
the O
service O
- O
our O
waiter B-AS
brought O
our O
drinks B-AS
and O
food B-AS
out O
promptly O
. O

My O
dining B-AS
companion O
had O
a O
steak B-AS
with O
so O
much O
fat B-AS
on O
it O
that O
he O
had O
to O
send O
back O
it O
. O

the O
3rd O
however O
, O
the O
waiter B-AS
forgot O
to O
put O
in O
our O
order O
for O
food B-AS
and O
we O
ended O
up O
waiting B-AS
an O
hour O
for O
them O
( O
b O
/ O
c O
they O
were O
really O
busy O
) O
. O

I O
have O
been O
a O
waiter B-AS
for O
many O
years O
and O
I O
can O
tell O
you O
that O
if O
bad O
service B-AS
is O
given O
you O
at O
least O
apologize O
to O
the O
costumer O
. O

Waited O
an O
hour O
for O
the O
food B-AS
to O
come O
out O
, O
couldnt O
even O
find O
the O
waitress B-AS
. O

When O
one O
of O
our O
party O
brazenly O
asked O
to O
substitue O
a O
flavor O
of O
gelato O
for O
one O
of O
the O
desserts B-AS
on O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
the O
waiter B-AS
snobbishly O
told O
us O
that O
, O
Mario O
and O
the O
chef B-AS
don O
' O
t O
like O
to O
do O
that O
. O

The O
decor B-AS
is O
nothing O
great O
to O
speak O
of O
, O
but O
who O
cares O
- O
the O
food B-AS
is O
top O
notch O
. O

The O
Food O
The O
seafood B-AS
- I-AS
dominant I-AS
fusion I-AS
menu I-AS
features O
standout O
starters O
, O
like O
super O
- O
fresh O
raw O
bar O
oysters O
, O
crispy O
citrus O
- O
pepperoncini O
calamari O
and O
flaky O
lobster B-AS
- I-AS
mushroom I-AS
tart I-AS
with I-AS
fiery I-AS
chorizo I-AS
and O
caramelized O
onions O
. O

Even O
though O
we O
complained O
several O
times O
, O
they O
brought O
us O
the O
bill B-AS
before O
dessert B-AS
and O
the O
manager B-AS
came O
to O
our O
table B-AS
to O
mention O
he O
was O
closing O
the O
place O
for O
the O
night O
. O

I O
forget O
the O
name O
of O
the O
dish B-AS
but O
anyone O
going O
here O
must O
get O
the O
shrimp B-AS
cooked O
in O
molases O
and O
rum O
. O

My O
wife O
and O
I O
invited O
our O
friends O
to O
a O
late O
dinner B-AS
and O
were O
having O
drinks O
afterwards O
when O
the O
manager O
instructed O
the O
waitress B-AS
not O
to O
serve O
us O
any O
more O
drinks O
as O
it O
was O
bottle O
service O
. O

Wait B-AS
staff I-AS
started O
swarming O
around O
us O
as O
if O
we O
just O
ordered O
cokes O
throughout O
lunch B-AS
. O

I O
read O
the O
high O
reviews O
for O
Lombardi O
' O
s O
and O
John O
' O
s O
, O
and O
disliked O
the O
pizza B-AS
I O
got O
at O
both O
places O
, O
so O
Grimaldi O
' O
s O
was O
my O
last O
try O
at O
finding O
the O
perfect O
pie B-AS
in O
NYC O
. O

When O
I O
questioned O
the O
purpose O
of O
waiting B-AS
on O
this O
line O
, O
I O
was O
asked O
to O
leave O
the O
bar B-AS
. O

This O
is O
definately O
a O
place O
to O
go O
for O
drinks B-AS
and O
then O
get O
dinner B-AS
somewhere O
else O
! O

Our O
server O
, O
Ben O
, O
was O
perhaps O
the O
best O
waiter B-AS
I O
' O
ve O
ever O
had O
- O
- O
he O
walked O
us O
through O
the O
menu B-AS
to O
design O
our O
meal O
, O
and O
suggested O
what O
textures O
, O
tastes O
, O
and O
wines O
would O
complement O
each O
other O
. O

In O
the O
hour O
we O
waited O
for O
our O
food B-AS
we O
had O
to O
remind O
our O
mentally O
challenged O
waitress B-AS
3times O
to O
bring O
our O
chipssalsa O
. O

The O
kitchen B-AS
is O
fast O
, O
but O
you O
sometime O
may O
have O
trouble O
getting O
a O
seat B-AS
, O
since O
this O
place O
is O
very O
small O
. O

I O
met O
a O
client O
here O
and O
wasn O
' O
t O
expecting O
much O
but O
after O
the O
lunch B-AS
was O
over O
, O
I O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised O
with O
the O
quality B-AS
of O
the O
meal B-AS
and O
the O
price B-AS
point I-AS
. O

Good O
date O
place O
too O
, O
if O
the O
date O
isn O
' O
t O
prissy O
about O
food B-AS
( O
I O
' O
ll O
marry O
the O
woman O
who O
splits O
the O
grilled B-AS
sardines I-AS
with O
me O
) O
. O

The O
menu B-AS
is O
short O
and O
sweet O
: O
hamburgers O
, O
cheeseburgers O
and O
double O
cheeseburgers O
, O
with O
all O
- O
beef O
patties B-AS
steam I-AS
- I-AS
grilled I-AS
on O
a O
pile O
of O
onions B-AS
and O
served O
on O
square O
white O
buns O
with O
pickles O
. O

We O
also O
tried O
grilled B-AS
chicken I-AS
( O
not O
bad O
) O
, O
fried B-AS
whiting I-AS
( O
fried O
too O
long O
, O
very O
greasy O
) O
, O
taramasolata O
( O
too O
salty O
) O
, O
chicken B-AS
rice I-AS
soup I-AS
( O
oily O
mess O
) O
, O
and O
an O
OK O
Greek B-AS
salad I-AS
. O

True O
, O
the O
menu B-AS
doesn O
' O
t O
offer O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
choices O
and O
portions B-AS
are O
not O
la O
all O
- O
you O
- O
can O
- O
eat O
, O
buffet O
style O
( O
but O
is O
that O
a O
negative O
thing O
after O
all O
? O

I O
went O
recently O
for O
brunch B-AS
and O
will O
never O
go O
back O
- O
my O
glass B-AS
of I-AS
wine I-AS
was O
vinegary O
and O
obviously O
old O
, O
my O
food O
gummy O
and O
disgusting O
, O
and O
the O
service B-AS
totally O
ditzy O
. O

Food O
was O
served B-AS
very O
promptly O
, O
but O
our O
wait B-AS
for O
drinks B-AS
was O
surprisingly O
long O
. O

I O
politely O
told O
our O
waitress B-AS
about O
this O
and O
she O
was O
not O
only O
apologetic O
, O
but O
the O
manager B-AS
came O
over O
a O
minute O
later O
and O
apologized O
and O
bought O
myself O
and O
my O
guest O
another O
round O
of O
drinks B-AS
. O

Nothing O
wrong O
with O
the O
service B-AS
, O
either O
, O
but O
don O
' O
t O
we O
all O
want O
something O
more O
from O
a O
dining O
experience O
than O
just O
average O
for O
above O
- O
average O
prices B-AS
? O

Service B-AS
was O
atrocious O
: O
appetizers B-AS
came O
out O
3 O
minutes O
after O
we O
ordered O
, O
and O
10 O
minutes O
before O
we O
finally O
tracked O
down O
the O
bottle O
of O
wine O
we O
had O
ordered O
, O
the O
waiter B-AS
rushed O
us O
from O
start O
to O
finish O
, O
we O
had O
to O
repeatedly O
track O
down O
someone O
to O
pour O
us O
more O
wine O
since O
it O
wasn O
' O
t O
at O
the O
table O
, O
etc O
, O
etc O
. O

But O
the O
price B-AS
tag I-AS
was O
high O
, O
and O
the O
food B-AS
was O
comparable O
to O
a O
Las O
Vegas O
buffet O
for O
flavor O
and O
quality O
. O

In O
Short O
At O
this O
Upper O
East O
Side O

it O
' O

The O

the O

down O
to O
the O
perfection O
of O
the O

, O
it O
is O

Roof O
: O
very O
nice O
space B-AS
( O
although O
I O
know O
5 O
other O
rooftop O
bars B-AS
just O
as O
good O
) O
, O
but O
the O
crowd O
was O
a O
bunch O
of O
posers B-AS
and O
the O
owner O
was O
a O
tool O
. O

The O
Food O
The O
casual O
Middle B-AS
Eastern I-AS
menu I-AS
looks O
familar O
, O
but O
the O
food O
- O
- O
made O
to O
order O
in O
the O
open B-AS
kitchen I-AS
- O
- O
is O
a O
notch O
above O
its O
peers O
. O

Good O
value B-AS
for O
breakfast B-AS
. O

The O
waitress B-AS
waited O
until O
I O
went O
to O
the O
bathroom O
to O
ask O
my O
friend O
to O
order O
more O
food B-AS
. O

Great O
food B-AS
- O
- O
but O
some O
of O
the O
worst O
service B-AS
in O
the O
neighborhood O
. O

We O
ordered O
two O
appetizers B-AS
and O
two O
entrees B-AS
and O
were O
absolutely O
stuffed O
, O
we O
couldn O
' O
t O
even O
finish O
our O
meals B-AS
. O

The O
menu B-AS
is O
a O
bit O
different O
and O
all O
of O
the O
selections B-AS
are O
pretty O
tasty O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
this O
place O
as O
a O
great O
introduction O
to O
someone O
who O
has O
never O
tried O
indian B-AS
food I-AS
as O
they O
give O
you O
tiny O
appetizer B-AS
like O
portions B-AS
of O
a O
myriad O
of O
items O
( O
that O
they O
keep O
bringing O
you O
more O
of O
) O
, O
so O
if O
you O
aren O
' O
t O
crazy O
about O
an O
item O
it O
' O
s O
not O
a O
big O
deal O
b O
/ O
c O
there O
are O
a O
ton O
of O
other O
dishes O
to O
try O
. O

Reserve O
a O
cozy O
window O
seat O
for O
more O
privacy B-AS
, O
or O
hop O
onto O
a O
stool O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
to O
dine O
solo O
. O

The O
sandwiches O
, O
platters B-AS
, O
and O
pitzas O
are O
top O
notch O
too O
, O
but O
I O
could O
make O
a O
meal B-AS
just O
out O
of O
their O
pita O
bread O
and O
babaganoush O
. O

waiters B-AS
were O
very O
nice O
, O
they O
dont O
take O
reservations O
during O
the O
week O
end O
, O
we O
waited O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
with O
some O
sangria B-AS
, O
Very O
good O
experience O
, O
loud O
music O
but O
we O
were O
able O
to O
communicate O
easily O
, O
overall O
i O
recommand O
this O
place O
to O
groups O
and O
dates B-AS
, O
Will O
be O
back O
more O
often O
! O

Accompaning O
fish O
or O
meat O
are O
some O
hefty O
side O
dishes B-AS
such O
as O
white B-AS
rice I-AS
, O
black B-AS
beans I-AS
, O
yucca O
, O
radish O
, O
tomato B-AS
, O
and O
green O
pepper O
salad O
, O
or O
plaintains O
cooked O
a O
variety O
of O
different O
ways O
. O

It O
was O
somewhere O
between O
our O
waiter B-AS
not O
knowing O
what O
sushi B-AS
came O
as O
part O
of O
the O
tasting O
platter O
and O
the O
copious O
amounts O
of O
wine B-AS
that O
he O
spilt O
while O
trying O
to O
pour O
me O
a O
taste O
that O
I O
realized O
. O

My O
friend O
was O
a O
vegetarian O
and O
the O
staff B-AS
went O
out O
of O
their O
way O
to O
provide O
her O
with O
a O
special O
entree B-AS
. O

The O
waitress B-AS
came O
three O
times O
: O
to O
take O
our O
order O
, O
to O
bring O
the O
order O
, O
and O
to O
bring O
the O
check B-AS
. O

The O
second O
time O
we O
went O
the O
waiter B-AS
didn O
' O
t O
put O
in O
our O
pizza B-AS
order O
! O

The O
restaurant O
didn O
' O
t O
mind O
me O
sitting O
on O
their O
doorstep O
to O
the O
extent O
that O
the O
bartender B-AS
invited O
me O
in O
for O
a O
drink B-AS
. O

Although O
the O
service B-AS
can O
be O
a O
bit O
brusque O
at O
times O
, O
the O
food B-AS
is O
always O
good O
, O
hearty O
and O
hot O
. O

Entrees B-AS
are O
right O
around O
$ O
10 O
, O
with O
fried O
rice O
and O
noodles B-AS
being O
a O
little O
cheaper O
. O

The O
server B-AS
was O
condescending O
and O
was O
unable O
to O
provide O
assistance O
with O
menu B-AS
selections I-AS
. O

The O
portions B-AS
are O
like O
a O
buffett O
for O
breakfast B-AS
. O

17 O
for O
a O
small O
cup B-AS
of O
tea B-AS
. O

After O
a O
waiter B-AS
spilled O
a O
soda B-AS
on O
me O
, O
without O
cleaning O
it O
up O
, O
offering O
me O
a O
napkin O
, O
or O
apologizing O
, O
I O
tried O
to O
send O
back O
my O
awful O
friench O
fries B-AS
. O

He O
let O
us O
be O
seated O
, O
but O
told O
the O
hostess B-AS
to O
make O
sure O
we O
didn O
' O
t O
get O
menus B-AS
until O
it O
was O
our O
arrival O
time O
. O

Hostess B-AS
was O
extremely O
accommodating O
when O
we O
arrived O
an O
hour O
early O
for O
our O
reservation B-AS
. O

Furthermore O
, O
while O
the O
fish B-AS
is O
unquestionably O
fresh O
, O
rolls B-AS
tend O
to O
be O
inexplicably O
bland O
. O

Wide O
range B-AS
of O
dim B-AS
sum I-AS
and O
food O
. O

I O
have O
gotten O
warmer O
and O
much O
friendlier O
welcome B-AS
and O
outstanding O
service B-AS
at O
the O
other O
Thai O
restaurants O
in O
the O
Greenpoint O
area B-AS
. O

I O
went O
anyway O
and O
was O
greeted O
by O
the O
rude O
owner B-AS
who O
practicly O
ripped O
our O
outside O
drink B-AS
from O
our O
hands O
( O
although O
we O
were O
trying O
to O
throw O
it O
out O
anyway O
. O

Since O
I O
listened O
closely O
, O
I O
know O
they O
were O
a O
party O
of O
2 O
without O
any O
reservation B-AS
The O
manager B-AS
then O
offered O
to O
seat O
us O
but O
we O
left O
. O

In O
summary O
: O
a O
terribly O
obnoxious O
and O
impolite O
host O
, O
a O
long O
and O
cramped O
wait O
for O
a O
table O
( O
complete O
with O
a O
mediocre O
bartender B-AS
and O
drinks B-AS
) O
, O
more O
bad O
host O
, O
a O
calamari B-AS
appetizer I-AS
that O
may O
have O
actually O
been O
a O
joke O
, O
an O
hour O
' O
s O
wait O
for O
our O
entrees B-AS
, O
and O
tough O
chop B-AS
- I-AS
away I-AS
- I-AS
at I-AS
- I-AS
it I-AS
veal I-AS
. O

When O
we O
received O
the O
bill B-AS
, O
we O
asked O
the O
manager B-AS
to O
do O
something O
about O
the O
drinks B-AS
, O
considering O
how O
poor O
the O
service B-AS
was O
and O
her O
reply O
was O
, O
Well O
, O
you O
got O
them O
! O

Always O
a O
treat O
, O
the O
butter O
chicken O
, O
palak B-AS
paneer I-AS
, O
and O
goat O
curries O
are O
sensational O
, O
while O
the O
tandoori B-AS
, O
samosas O
, O
and O
chana O
aloo O
are O
a O
bit O
dry O
. O

For O
entrees B-AS
the O
suckling B-AS
pig I-AS
is O
a O
ho O
- O
hum O
pile O
of O
pulled O
pork B-AS
and O
the O
fish O
- O
of O
- O
the O
- O
day O
was O
merely O
good O
. O

Sure O
the O
service B-AS
isn O
' O
t O
the O
best O
but O
the O
food B-AS
is O
tasty O
and O
the O
prices B-AS
are O
great O
. O

I O
tried O
almost O
everything O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
but O
my O
fav O
is O
the O
pumkin B-AS
raviloi I-AS
, O
too O
bad O
it O
' O
s O
only O
seasonal O
. O

the O
first O
was O
dinner B-AS
opening O
week O
some O
time O
ago O
- O
not O
a O
good O
piece O
of O
sushi B-AS
to O
be O
had O
, O
the O
robata B-AS
was O
so O
so O
and O
nothing O
was O
remotely O
memorable O
. O

we O
had O
to O
wait O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
for O
a O
table O
, O
but O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
bustling O
and O
is O
well O
worth O
it O
. O

Took O
20 O
minutes O
and O
three O
requests O
to O
the O
waitress B-AS
to O
get O
a O
drink B-AS
, O
and O
then O
my O
steak B-AS
came O
opposite O
to O
how O
I O
ordered O
it O
- O
- O
twice O
! O

As O
if O
the O
2 O
hour O
wait O
wasn O
' O
t O
bad O
enough O
, O
the O
host B-AS
/ I-AS
manager I-AS
was O
so O
busy O
flirting O
with O
attractive O
female O
customers O
, O
he O
didn O
' O
t O
seem O
to O
notice O
we O
had O
been O
sitting O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
and O
we O
ended O
up O
missing O
his O
call O
. O

We O
could O
have O
made O
a O
meal B-AS
of O
the O
yummy O
dumplings B-AS
from O
the O
dumpling B-AS
menu I-AS
. O

Our O
meals B-AS
were O
a O
moderate O
portion B-AS
and O
they O
weren O
' O
t O
too O
spicy O
. O

large O
portions B-AS
so O
unless O
you O
are O
of O
large O
stature O
you O
should O
not O
get O
2 O
appetizers B-AS
. O

While O
being O
shown O
to O
our O
table O
by O
a O
hostess B-AS
, O
we O
were O
welcomed O
by O
Lidia O
Bastianich O
herself O
and O
seated B-AS
at O
a O
great O
table O
in O
the O
dining O
room O
- O
- O
not O
too O
secluded O
, O
but O
not O
noisy O
. O

this O
is O
the O
style B-AS
of I-AS
cooking I-AS
that O
takes O
normal O
dishes B-AS
to O
new O
highs O
. O

Fantastic O
flavor B-AS
, O
but O
certainly O
not O
worth O
the O
high O
price B-AS
of O
the O
small O
glass B-AS
. O

even O
if O
you O
have O
to O
wait O
for O
a O
spot B-AS
at O
the O
bar B-AS
to O
wait O
for O
your O
table O
, O
the O
music O
and O
design O
of O
the O
space B-AS
create O
an O
ambiance B-AS
that O
is O
simultaneously O
chic O
and O
comfortable O
- O
something O
extraordinarily O
difficult O
to O
find O
in O
this O
city O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
was O
a O
little O
annoying O
was O
that O
the O
hostess B-AS
didnt O
want O
to O
let O
us O
finish O
our O
first O
drinks B-AS
at O
the O
bar B-AS
and O
kept O
rushing O
us O
to O
sit O
down O
. O

My O
only O
two O
complaints O
are O
that O
( O
1 O
) O
our O
server O
was O
a O
real O
space B-AS
cadet O
and O
kinda O
inattentive O
and O
( O
2 O
) O
the O
sodas O
were O
really O
small O
; O
overall O
, O
though O
, O
I O
had O
a O
great O
time O
and O
really O
enjoyed O
my O
dinner B-AS
! O

The O
fact O
that O
the O
resteraunt B-AS
staff I-AS
couldn O
' O
t O
even O
keep O
a O
reservation B-AS
straight O
, O
not O
to O
mention O
that O
after O
screwing O
up O
, O
they O
told O
us O
to O
go O
scratch O
and O
made O
us O
wait O
almost O
2 O
hours O
. O

The O
portions B-AS
were O
overly O
generous O
for O
both O
the O
apps B-AS
and O
entrees O
without O
sacrificing O
the O
quality O
. O

While O
dining B-AS
, O
none O
of O
us O
were O
impressed O
with O
the O
food B-AS
. O

Ziti B-AS
Bolognese I-AS
is O
baked O
in O
a O
similar O
sauce O
, O
with O
ground O
meat O
mixed O
in O
and O
cheese O
melted O
on O
top O
- O
- O
the O
menu B-AS
offers O
many O
variations O
on O
this O
theme O
. O

Our O
server O
lamely O
offered O
a O
free O
after B-AS
- I-AS
dinner I-AS
drink I-AS
to O
make O
up O
for O
it O
after O
he O
failed O
to O
even O
ask O
how O
the O
food B-AS
was O
once O
it O
was O
served O
. O

Even O
if O
you O
' O
re O
just O
a O
middling O
junior O
exec B-AS
, O
staff B-AS
service I-AS
makes O
you O
feel O
like O
a O
board O
member O
. O

Two O
complaints O
- O
their O
appetizer B-AS
selection I-AS
stinks O
, O
it O
would O
be O
nice O
to O
get O
some O
mozzarella O
sticks O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
. O

my O
sister O
asked O
for O
iced B-AS
tea I-AS
twice O
and O
the O
waitress B-AS
said O
they O
didn O
' O
t O
have O
. O

The O
service B-AS
could O
be O
better O
but O
the O
management O
( O
Mariano B-AS
) O
is O
quite O
helpful O
if O
there O
are O
any O
problems O
. O

Evening O
started O
out O
nice O
w O
/ O
complimentary O
glass B-AS
of I-AS
champagne I-AS
, O
but O
turned O
sour O
as O
mussels B-AS
were O
extremely O
overcooked O
, O
steak B-AS
came O
in O
kid O
size O
portion B-AS
smothered I-AS
with I-AS
sauce I-AS
and O
owner B-AS
recommended I-AS
a O
wine O
special O
off O
the O
standard O
wine O
menu O
that O
was O
double O
the O
price B-AS
of O
the O
most O
expensive O
bottle O
but O
made O
no O
effort O
to O
describe O
the O
wine O
as O
extremely O
special O
or O
significantly O
more O
expensive O
that O
what O
they O
typically O
serve O
. O

We O
enjoyed O
the O
Raw B-AS
Bar I-AS
Special I-AS
which O
was O
choice O
of O
6 O
raw B-AS
oysters I-AS
or O
clams B-AS
and O
a O
drink B-AS
( O
house O

or O
a O

Twister B-AS

too O
salty O
and O
nothing O
spectacular O
; O
Mango B-AS
sorbet I-AS
- O
so O
flavorful O
and O
rich O
, O
it O
tasted O
like O
ice B-AS
cream I-AS
! O

If O
you O
are O
expecting O
big O
portions B-AS
, O
go O
find O
a O
Cheesecake B-AS
Factory I-AS
. O

We O
explained O
that O
we O
had O
left O
a O
standard O
15 O
% O
on O
food B-AS
, O
and O
a O
slightly O
smaller O
percentage B-AS
on O
alcohol O
( O
At O
least O
10 O
% O
) O

better O
for O

with O
friends O

significant O
others B-AS
. O

Subtle O
decor B-AS
, O
above O
average O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
and O
a O
menu B-AS
with O
a O
difference O
. O

Our O
waiter B-AS
( O
the O
one O
with O
the O
Spanish O
accent O
) O
was O
a O
bit O
pre O
- O
occupied O
with O
other O
things O
- O
hardly O
coming O
around O
to O
the O
table O
and O
nowhere O
to O
be O
seen O
most O
of O
the O
time B-AS
. O

The O

Less O

than O

less O

and O
infinitely O
more O
charming O
is O
Bean B-AS

a O
Mexican B-AS
spot I-AS
on O
Bedford O

Great O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
with O
an O
extra O
expensive O
selection B-AS
for O
all O
you O
big O
spenders O
. O

And O
toppings B-AS
are O
not O
the O
best O
way O
to O
go O
here O
, O
and O
if O
you O
do O
, O
choose O
wisely O
- O
- O
it O
is O
a O
very O
thin O
crust O
that O
can O
' O
t O
support O
much O
more O
than O
the O
fine O
sauce O
and O
sublime O
cheese B-AS
it O
already O
has O
. O

The O
salsa B-AS
always O
tastes O
like O
V8 O
with O
onion B-AS
pieces I-AS
. O

This O
is O

I O
always O
trek O
to O
Bar B-AS
89 O
and O
get O
one O
of O
their O
huge O
sandwiches B-AS
that O
comes O
with O
fries B-AS
. O

Expect O
to O
be O
cramped O
and O
you O
may O
have O
to O
wait O
a O
little O
for O
your O
food B-AS
, O
but O
the O
service B-AS
is O
really O
friendly O
and O
helpful O
. O

The O
waitress B-AS
told O
me O
that O
their O
dessert B-AS
chef I-AS
was O
trained O
in O
Sicily O
. O

Each O
course B-AS
was O
accompanied O
by O
a O
new O
wine B-AS
. O

Although O
, O
a O
limited O
menu B-AS
, O
we O
had O
no O
trouble O
picking O
out O
our O
delicious O
meal B-AS
. O

The O
festive B-AS
crew I-AS
serves O
from O
a O
gigantic O
menu B-AS
of O
American O

It O
was O
there O
that O
we O
ordered O
dinner B-AS
by O
starting O
out O
with O
the O
foie B-AS
gras I-AS
mousse I-AS
which O
was O
a O
wonderful O
a O
reccomendation O
by O
the O
waiter B-AS
. O

We O
had O
a O
late O
9 O
: O
30 O
pm O
reservation B-AS
; O
when O
we O
arrived O
and O
went O
to O
be O
seated O
, O
there O
was O
some O
type O
of O
discrepancy O
since O
the O
hostess B-AS
was O
missing O
in O
action O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
bad O
enough O
that O
we O
decided O
to O
head O
out O
after O
the O
first O
round O
of O
drinks B-AS
. O

Mojitos B-AS
were O
good O
and O
prices B-AS
werent O
bad O
but O
sides O
should O
be O
included O
in O
price O
as O
portions B-AS
are O
tiny O
. O

When O
asked O
to O
compare O
between O
two O
dishes B-AS
, O
the O
server B-AS
said O
whatever O
you O
like O
. O

The O
bar O
tender O
didn O
' O
t O
know O
where O
the O
tea B-AS
was O
, O
waiters B-AS
started O
making O
the O
drinks B-AS
if O
the O
bar O
tender O
wasn O
' O
t O
around O
. O

i O
had O
a O
horrible O
experience O
with O
a O
waiter B-AS
while O
trying O
to O
have O
breakfast B-AS
friday O
morning O
. O

I O
have O
been O
surrounded O
with O
Indian B-AS
food I-AS
my O
entire O
life O
, O
and O
my O
lunch B-AS
time O
experience O
at O
Devi O
was O
absolute O
bliss O
. O

tender B-AS
grilled I-AS
calamari I-AS
, O
shrimp B-AS

puff I-AS

. O

I O
always O
get O
cantonese O
wonton B-AS
noodle I-AS
soup I-AS
here O
, O
but O
the O
chicken B-AS
is O
also O
almost O
always O
good O
. O

Get O
the O
bacon B-AS
( O
best O
ever O
, O
hands O
down O
) O
and O
shrimp B-AS
cocktail I-AS
to O
start O
and O
steak B-AS
for O
how O
many O
ever O
to O
finish O
. O

The O
waiters B-AS
can O
shoot O
off O
a O
5 O
minute O
long O
list O
of O
specials O
, O
and O
they O
know O
the O
menu B-AS
very O
well O
. O

Another O
hostess B-AS
came O
by O
and O
told O
us O
that O
since O
we O
were O
now O
5 O
we O
were O
a O
different O
table B-AS
and O
couldnt O
' O
stay O
. O

They O
cook O
the O
cheese B-AS
so O
that O
it O
turns O
a O
nice O
brown O
color O
and O
it O
is O
absolutely O
the O
best O
pizza B-AS
I O
' O
ve O
ever O
had O
in O
New O
York O
. O

The O
staff B-AS
is O
constantly O
disappearing O
from O
the O
restaurant O
, O
making O
it O
impossible O
to O
get O
drink B-AS
refills O
or O
to O
get O
the O
check O
. O

Reservations B-AS
for O
parties O
under O
5 O
people O
isn O
' O
t O
allowed O
but O
their O
yummy O
cocktails O
and O
handsome O
waiters B-AS
help O
soothe O
the O
pain O
. O

The O
Scene B-AS
With O
three O
outposts O
around O
town O
, O
Sarabeth O
' O
s O
Kitchen B-AS
has O
become O
a O
well O
- O
known O
and O
reliable O
spot B-AS
for O
casual O
dining B-AS
at O
breakfast B-AS
, O
lunch B-AS
or O
dinner B-AS
. O

I O
had O
fried O
chicken O
of O
which O
KFC O
runs O
circles O
around O
, O
and O
the O
fries B-AS
were O
a O
knock O
off O
of O
poor O
burger B-AS
king O
spuds O
. O

The O
menu B-AS
of O
upscale O
American O
fare O
is O
somewhat O
intimidating O
as O
there O
are O
almost O
too O
many O
choices O
, O
but O
our O
wonderful O
waiter B-AS
Eric O
came O
to O
the O
rescue O
suggesting O
and O
describing O
specials O
as O
if O
he O
had O
just O
polished O
off O
dinner O
himself O
. O

If O
you O
go O
, O
try O
the O
marinara B-AS
/ I-AS
arrabiatta I-AS
sauce I-AS
, O
the O
mozzarella B-AS
en I-AS
Carozza O
is O
mmmmmmmm O
. O

We O
were O
not O
offered O
the O
dessert B-AS
menu I-AS
and O
that O
waiter B-AS
was O
so O
rude O
! O
~ O
I O
was O
very O
offended O
after O
a O
good O
meal O
. O

The O
manager B-AS
sent O
us O
a O
complimentary O
glass B-AS
of I-AS
wine I-AS
for O
the O
steak B-AS
not O
being O
cooked O
like O
he O
wanted O
. O

Don O
' O
t O
let O
the O
ambiance B-AS
of O
this O
place O
fool O
you O
, O
the O
food B-AS
is O
far O
better O
than O
many O
pricey O
establishments O
. O

The O
entrees B-AS
tasted O
like O
microwaveable O
meals B-AS
, O
the O
appetizers B-AS
were O
ordinary O
, O
the O
sauces B-AS
seemed O
like O
they O
came O
from O
a O
bottle O
, O
and O
the O
dessert B-AS
was O
worse O
than O
packaged O
food B-AS
. O

After O
asking O
the O
waiter B-AS
for O
a O
few O
minutes O
to O
look O
over O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
we O
had O
to O
call O
out O
several O
times O
over O
15 O
minutes O
to O
get O
him O
to O
come O
back O
to O
our O
table B-AS
. O

If O
the O
waitress B-AS
had O
been O
remotely O
available O
or O
had O
come O
by O
to O
enquire O
about O
our O
food B-AS
, O
I O
certainly O
would O
have O
sent O
it O
back O
, O
but O
since O
I O
was O
being O
taken O
out O
for O
a O
birthday O
dinner B-AS
I O
did O
not O
want O
to O
make O
a O
fuss O
. O

Food B-AS
tasted O
good O
( O
for O
the O
most O
part O
) O
, O
but O
it O
is O
customary O
to O
ask O
people O
how O
they O
would O
like O
their O
steak B-AS
done O
( O
all O
5 O
of O
ours O
were O
RAW O
. O

The O
pot B-AS
pie I-AS
, O
pork B-AS
chop I-AS
and O
chicken B-AS
were O
cleaned O
off O
the O
plates B-AS
so O
well O
they O
didn O
' O
t O
need O
washing O
. O

our O
dinner B-AS
was O
marred O
by O
painfully O
slow O
service B-AS
. O

Drinks B-AS
are O
overpriced O
; O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
is O
good O
. O

I O
was O
interrupted O
by O
the O
waiter B-AS
to O
say O
that O
when O
we O
are O
done O
with O
dinner B-AS
he O
' O
d O
bring O
one O
. O

The O
other O
side O
of O
the O
menu B-AS
offers O
chicken B-AS
, O
veal O
, O
and O
seafood B-AS
standards O
, O
including O
perfect O
saltimbocca B-AS
and O
a O
huge O
, O
succulent O
veal B-AS
chop I-AS
. O

There O
was O
only O
one O
server B-AS
on O
duty O
and O
we O
waited O
a O
while O
for O
menus B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
so O
not O
Shanghai O
, O
but O
apparently O
those O
in O
the O
crowded O
dining O
room O
and O
waiting O
for O
tables B-AS
wouldn O
' O
t O
know O
the O
difference O
. O

Great O
place B-AS
to O
meet O
friends O
or O
co O
workers B-AS
for O
drinks B-AS
, O
dinner B-AS
or O
both O
. O

After O
waiting B-AS
to O
get O
a O
table O
for O
over O
a O
half O
hour O
even O
though O
we O
had O
reservations B-AS
, O
we O
went O
up O
to O
the O
host B-AS
. O

While O
the O
food B-AS
was O
good O
( O
certainly O
no O
Il O
Mulino O
) O
the O
service B-AS
was O
horrendous O
. O

Went O
to O
dinner B-AS
with O
friends O
, O
food B-AS
was O
good O
, O
but O
the O
waitress O
was O
snippy O
, O
gave O
several O
exasperated O
sighs O
, O
kept O
pushing O
us O
to O
order O
more O
wine B-AS
- O
on O
a O
sunday O
night O
- O
and O
now O
I O
realize O
that O
she O
added O
an O
eztra O
20 O
% O
to O
my O
debit O
charge O
. O

The O
two O
cons O
were O
the O
lack O
of O
information O
on O
the O
menus B-AS
( O
they O
had O
just O
sushi O
roll O
names O
, O
with O
no O
description O
of O
their O
contents O
, O
printed O
in O
a O
bland O
format O
) O
, O
and O
music B-AS
selection I-AS
, O
which O
didn O
' O
t O
fit O
the O
ambiance B-AS
. O

I O
go O
in O
for O
lunch B-AS
whenever O
I O
can O
and O
have O
the O
thinnest O
sliced O
pastrami O
, O
along O
with O
fresh O
cut O
home O
- O
made O
potato B-AS
chips I-AS
. O

The O
kids O
really O
enjoyed O
their O
food B-AS
and O
the O
value B-AS
on O
the O
kids O
menu B-AS
is O
good O
. O

Great O
decor B-AS
, O
expensive O
drinks O
but O
worth O
the O
price B-AS
, O
but O
the O
music O
is O
bland O
and O
the O
crowd O
is O
very O
cheezy O
. O

Could O
have O
gone O
to O
Pastis O
for O
a O
salad B-AS
three O
times O
the O
size B-AS
for O
the O
same O
price B-AS
. O

Friendly O
service B-AS
, O
and O
outdoor O
seating B-AS
in O
the O
warm O
months O
, O
eases O
the O
crush O
. O

We O
asked O
for O
the O
check B-AS
and O
had O
to O
wait O
20mins O
for O
the O
waitress B-AS
to O
come O
back O
and O
take O
our O
card O
. O

Besides O
, O
they O
used O
to O
be O
much O
more O
accommodating O
when O
I O
used O
to O
request O
a O
jalebi O
paratha O
instad O
of O
a O
plain O
naan B-AS
as O
part O
of O
the O
brunch B-AS
price I-AS
. O

Crowds B-AS
do O
come O
on O
weekends O
, O
so O
be O
sure O
to O
make O
reservations B-AS
. O

When O
I O
really O
need O
good O
pizza B-AS
I O
fly O
in O
From O
Arizona O
for O
a O
few O
pies B-AS
, O
go O
to O
friends O
house O
, O
freeze O
them O
and O
fly O
home O
. O

Conversation O
went O
like O
this O
: O
waiter B-AS
: O
presented O
the O
steak B-AS
and O
said O
' O
Meduim O
well O
' O

From O
the O
complimentary O
chef B-AS
app I-AS
of O
a O
delicate O
butternut O
squash O
ravioli O
in O
a O
delicious O
truffle O
sauce O
to O
an O
amazing O
buttery O
and O
tender O
langostine O
entree O
to O
a O
dessert B-AS
that O
I O
can O
' O
t O
remember O
because O
of O
the O
fabulous O
Cakebread B-AS
Cabernet I-AS
we O
were O
drinking O
- O
- O
the O
whole O
evening O
was O
amazing O
. O

However O
, O
the O
food B-AS
, O
once O
you O
get O
over O
the O
price B-AS
, O
was O
very O
good O
. O

she O
never O
once O
checked O
on O
us O
after O
serving O
our O
drinks B-AS
, O
we O
asked O
another O
waitress B-AS
about O
our O
sandwiches B-AS
, O
she O
attempted O
to O
check O
on O
them O
but O
didn O
' O
t O
really O
get O
an O
answer O
. O

We O
sat O
there O
with O
the O
check B-AS
and O
ordered O
dessert B-AS
and O
more O
drinks B-AS
. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
avoid O
the O
long O
lines B-AS
, O
arrive O
at O
5 O
: O
00 O
PM O
and O
have O
an O
early O
dinner B-AS
. O

: O
after O
ordering O
a O
bottle B-AS
of I-AS
wine I-AS
( O
which O
was O
originally O
, O
inexplicably O
mistaken O
for O
2 O
glasses B-AS
of O
it O
) O
, O
the O
( O
2 O
) O
waitresses B-AS
in O
charge O
of O
the O
outdoor B-AS
space I-AS
claimed O
that O
the O
bottle O
was O
right O
there O
in O
the O
only O
cooler O
used O
to O
service B-AS
about O
10 O
tables O
. O

We O
were O
coldly O
greeted O
by O
a O
hostess B-AS
and O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
who O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
our O
reservation B-AS
, O
did O
not O
want O
to O
seat O
any O
of O
us O
, O
including O
the O
elderly O
, O
until O
our O
entire O
party O
had O
arrived O
. O

and O
although O
the O
service B-AS
is O
a O
little O
slow O
, O
the O
lax O
atmosphere B-AS
allows O
you O
to O
drink O
and O
eat O
away O
the O
afternoon B-AS
or O
evening O
and O
not O
even O
care O
. O

I O
was O
expecting O
an O
average O
meal B-AS
and O
was O
really O
pleased O
to O
get O
an O
awesome O
dinner B-AS
- O
and O
it O
was O
pretty O
cheap O
too O
. O

The O
service O
and O
surroundings B-AS
couldn O
' O
t O
have O
been O
better O
, O
but O
the O
food B-AS
was O
very O
disapointing O
at O
best O
. O

We O
heard O
two O
different O
servers B-AS
telling O
tables O
about O
these O
specials B-AS
, O
and O
when O
we O
asked O
to O
hear O
them O
, O
they O
wouldn O
' O
t O
tell O
us O
them O
. O

Up O
front O
, O
a O
large O
bay O
window O
provides O
a O
basement O
view O
of O
the O
neighborhood O
; O
at O
the O
rear O
, O
the O
tiny O
open O
kitchen O
serves O
up O
a O
limited O
variety O
of O
dishes B-AS
: O
fish B-AS
and O
chips O
, O
Thai O
chicken O
and O
hamburgers B-AS
with I-AS
caramelized I-AS

The O
Food B-AS
Kolonaki O
serves O
up O
everything O
from O
a O
European O
tuna O
sandwich O
( O
made O
with O
tuna B-AS
, I-AS
lemon I-AS
juice I-AS
, O
capers B-AS
, O
parsley B-AS
, O
onions B-AS
, O
carrots O
, O
olive O
oil O
and O
basil O
) O
to O
scrumptious O
specialty B-AS
desserts I-AS
. O

I O
went O
for O
the O
wine B-AS
tasting O
dinner B-AS
. O

The O
decor B-AS
is O
a O
little O
plain O
and O
the O
seating O
is O
a O
touch O
too O
close O
but O
its O
worth O
it O
for O
the O
food B-AS
. O

Food O
took O
over O
an O
hour O
despite O
at O
least O
two O
chasers O
, O
we O
had O
to O
track O
the O
server B-AS
down O
to O
get O
extra O
drinks B-AS
, O
the O
manager B-AS
seemed O
to O
try O
and O
deliberately O
mislead O
us O
about O
the O
reason O
behind O
the O
delay O
and O
in O
the O
end O
the O
food O
was O
poor O
. O

Bartender B-AS
made O
a O
bad O
drink B-AS
for O
me O
and O
I O
sent O
it O
back O
and O
was O
charged O
for O
it O
. O

as O
appetizers B-AS
, O
we O
ordered O
the O
zucchini B-AS
flowers I-AS
( O
rich O
savory O
) O
escargot B-AS
- I-AS
topped I-AS
mushroom I-AS
caps O
( O
mediocre O
) O
. O

When O
I O
look O
at O
the O
menu B-AS
I O
was O
surprised O
at O
the O
relatively O
high O
price B-AS
compared O
with O
other O
korean O
restaurants O
. O

though O
the O
portions B-AS
were O
smaller O
than O
average O
, O
the O
flavor O
and O
sauces B-AS
that O
accompany O
them O
( O
truffle B-AS
honey I-AS
, O
cherries O
and O
peaches O
in O
mustard B-AS
sauce I-AS
) O
were O
all O
really O
good O
. O

their O
Stella O
on O
tap B-AS
was O
almost O
flat O
, O
i O
saw O
the O
bartender B-AS
whisking O
our O
beers O
to O
give O
them O
any O
sort O
of O
head O
. O

The O
restaurant O
is O
small O
so O
ask O
for O
seating B-AS
in O
the O
front O
upstairs O
( O
the O
back B-AS
, O
where O
we O
were O
sitting O
was O
incredibly O
hot O
) O
or O
on O
the O
first O
floor O
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
could O
not O
have O
been O
more O
patient O
with O
us O
as O
we O
( O
okay O
, O
my O
wife O
) O
made O
her O
decision O
on O
appetizers B-AS
. O

Went O
with O
my O
father O
without O
a O
reservation B-AS
, O
and O
the O
maitre B-AS
d O
' O
was O
very O
nice O
and O
sat O
us O
within O
15 O
minutes O
of O
our O
arrival O
- O
we O
had O
been O
told O
that O
the O
wait B-AS
would O
be O
an O
hour O
( O
this O
may O
be O
unusual O
) O
. O

All O
of O
us O
enjoyed O
our O
meal B-AS
, O
and O
for O
the O
price B-AS
( O
~ O
$ O
185 O
, O
w O
/ O
taxtip O
, O
2 O
bottles B-AS
of I-AS
wine I-AS
, O
1 O
appetizer O
each O
, O
plus O
entrees B-AS
) O
it O
was O
pretty O
impressive O
. O

We O
were O
a O
large O
group O
and O
would O
highly O
recommend O
all O
the O
drinks B-AS
and O
foodThe O
manager B-AS
on O
duty O
was O
understanding O
that O
our O
friends O
were O
very O
late O
and O
held O
our O
reservation B-AS
. O

The O
hostess B-AS
finally O
seated O
us O
at O
a O
table B-AS
for O
two O
when O
there O
were O
three O
of O
us O
in O
an O
empty O
restaurant O
. O

Once O
dinner B-AS
ended O
the O
party O
really O
started O
going O
inside O
they O
were O
playing O
great O
music B-AS
. O

The O
Food B-AS
There O
' O
s O
more O
here O
than O
top O
- O
quality O
sushi O
and O
sashimi B-AS
, O
like O
sugar O
- O
coated O
foie O
gras O
with O
cashews O
and O
balsamic O
ginger O
sauce O
. O

Seated O
in O
the O
upstairs O
part O
of O
the O
restaurant O
my O
party O
and O
I O
were O
subjected O
to O
rude O
, O
abrupt O
service B-AS
and O
unmercifully O
long O
waits O
for O
our O
food B-AS
. O

The O
sign O
outside O
said O
, O
26 O
beers B-AS
on O
tap B-AS
, O
however O
the O
bartender B-AS
was O
unable O
to O
pull O
a O
pint O
from O
any O
of O
them O
. O

While O
we O
enjoyed O
the O
appetizers B-AS
( O
kobe B-AS
beef I-AS
quesadillas O
and O
a O
mix B-AS
of I-AS
fries I-AS
) O
the O
burgers B-AS
themselves I-AS
were O
not O
nearly O
as O
good O
. O

Now O
admittedly O
I O
went O
at O
lunch O
, O
when O
presumably O
the O
kitchen B-AS
and O
waitstaff B-AS
are O
less O
taxed O
than O
at O
dinner B-AS
, O
but O
everything O
was O
fine O
. O

Instead O
, O
the O
chef B-AS
made O
me O
a O
special O
creation O
off O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
and O
wow O
. O

Management B-AS
or O
one O
of O
the O
many O
busboys O
should O
have O
been O
monitoring O
the O
tables O
more O
closely O
to O
ensure O
consistency O
- O
we O
had O
to O
ask O
for O
olive O
oil O
for O
the O
flatbread O
, O
when O
it O
was O
on O
nearly O
every O
other O
table O
as O
well O
as O
salt B-AS
and O
pepper B-AS
. O

I O
can O
only O
say O
that O
the O
soup B-AS
dumplings I-AS
are O
almost O
as O
good O
as O
Joe O
' O
s O
Shanghai O
and O
some O
dishes B-AS
I O
had O
( O
like O
Eight B-AS
Spice I-AS
appetizer I-AS
) O
were O
tasty O
while O
others O
( O
Shanghai O
style B-AS
Shumai O
) O
were O
less O
so O
. O

During O
the O
summer O
the O
outdoor B-AS
area I-AS
is O
a O
great O
place O
to O
sit O
and O
eat O
you O
pizza B-AS
. O

the O
staff B-AS
is O
great O
, O
but O
the O
food B-AS
is O
just O
ok O
. O

An O
order O
of O
roast B-AS
chicken I-AS
is O
nicely O
crisped O
and O
moist O
, O
although O
the O
potato B-AS
cubes I-AS
alongside O
are O
limp O
. O

from O
the O
hostess O
to O
the O
bartender B-AS
to O
the O
waiter B-AS
( O
who O
told O
us O
that O
we O
had O
to O
leave O
because O
the O
tables B-AS
needed O
to O
be O
turned O
around O
more O
quickly O
even O
though O
it O
was O
a O
friends O
engagement O
dinner B-AS
) O
. O

A O
friend O
asked O
for O
cheese B-AS
on O
her O
pasta B-AS
and O
the O
waitstaff O
, O
including O
the O
manager B-AS
, O
REFUSED O
to O
give O
it O
to O
her O
. O

After O
waiting B-AS
over O
a O
month O
for O
weekend O
reservations B-AS
, O
I O
would O
of O
rather O
gone O
to O
IL O
Baggato O
. O

Paul O
' O
s O
frozen O
seafood B-AS
and O
the O
other O
cuts O
of O
meat B-AS
were O
disappointing O
, O
with O
the O
only O
acceptable O
appetizers B-AS
being O
the O
corn B-AS
chowder I-AS
and O
the O
gravlax B-AS
. O

My O
g O
/ O
f O
and O
I O
walked O
in O
one O
night O
, O
the O
owner B-AS
greeted O
us O
at O
the O
door O
and O
took O
our O
coats O
, O
sat O
us O
in O
the O
back B-AS
room I-AS
( O
non O
- O
smoking O
at O
the O
time O
) O
. O

plenty O
of O
hipsters O
in O
carefully O
selected O

the O
tasty O
food B-AS
keeps O
luring O
me O
back O
, O
but O
after O
placing O
an O
order O
with O
who O
i O
assume O
must O
be O
the O
same O
rude O
sunday O
manager B-AS
i O
keep O
hearing O
about O
, O
i O
' O
m O
not O
sure O
i O
will O
again O
. O

( O
try O
the O
Queso B-AS
Fundido O
and O

) O
Upstairs O
there O
is O
a O
dining B-AS
room I-AS
which O
is O
decorated O
with O
brightly O
colored O
mexican O
theme B-AS
. O

We O
got O
seated O
right O
away O
, O
We O
got O
a O
nice O
starter B-AS
from O
the O
kitchen B-AS
, O
unfortunately O
the O
waiter B-AS
that O
brought O
it O
could O
not O
explain O
what O
it O
was O
, O
it O
was O
delicious O
though O
. O

We O
did O
not O
get O
asked O
how O
I O
meal B-AS
was O
nor O
did O
we O
get O
to O
our O
refill O
on O
waters O
until O
pretty O
much O
after O
the O
steak B-AS
was O
finished O
. O

If O
you O
' O
re O
looking O
for O

attention O
, O
a O
20 O

wine B-AS
list I-AS
and O
a O
waiter B-AS
who O
puts O
your O
napkin O
on O
your O
lap O
, O
this O
is O
not O
the O
place O
to O
go O
. O

I O
recently O
attended O
a O
celebratory B-AS
dinner I-AS
here O
and O
I O
just O
want O
to O
warn O
everyone O
that O
the O
service B-AS
is O
the O
worst O
I O
have O
ever O
experienced O
! O

I O
had O
sage O
- O
and O
- O
prosciutto O
- O
wrapped O
veal O
tenderloin O
; O
my O
companion O
had O
duck B-AS
with O
delightful O
cranberry B-AS
relish I-AS
; O
both O
served O
with O
carefully O
complementing O
, O
delicious O
sides O
. O

I O
must O
say O
I O
enjoyed O
their O
soup B-AS
dumplings I-AS
more O
than O
Joe O
' O
s O
, O
but O
the O
other O
dishes B-AS
were O
disappointing O
. O

There O
is O
NO O
waiting O
area O
- O
waiters B-AS
, O
diners B-AS
, O
and O
staff B-AS
all O
converge O
in O
a O
tight O
space B-AS
. O

First O
had O
a O
cheese B-AS
platter I-AS
at O
the O
bar B-AS
and O
then O
enjoyed O
a O
nice O
dinner B-AS
with O
friends O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
always O
good O
, O
and O
you O
get O
a O
lot O
for O
your O
money O
( O
the O
entrees O
, O
which O
are O
about O
$ O
7 O
- O
$ O
8 O
, O
come O
with O
the O
main O
selection O
plus O
two O
small O
sides B-AS
, O
such O
as O
some O
veggies B-AS
and O
two O
spring B-AS
rolls I-AS
) O
. O

As O
for O
the O
sides B-AS
, O
the O
grits B-AS
were O
more O
like O
soupy B-AS
cheese I-AS
sauce I-AS
; O
the O
greens B-AS
were O
okay O
. O

There O
was O
a O
fire O
crackling O
in O
the O
dining B-AS
room I-AS
, O
the O
bar B-AS
was O
a O
finished O
copper O
, O
the O
stools B-AS
were O
leather O
, O
and O
the O
lighting B-AS
wasn O
' O
t O
dim O
nor O
bright O
, O
but O
just O
. O

After O
we O
waited O
nearly O
25 O
minutes O
for O
our O
food B-AS
( O
the O
place O
wasnt O
crowded O
) O
, O
our O
waiter B-AS
forgot O
some O
of O
our O
order O
and O
brought O
out O
a O
salad O
when O
we O
asked O
for O
everything O
to O
come O
out O
all O
at O
once O
. O

Within O
3 O
minutes O
after O
we O
sat O
the O
waiter B-AS
was O
hovering O
over O
us O
to O
get O
our O
food B-AS
order O
. O

To O
be O
honest O
, O
it O
cost O
$ O
95 O
for O
two O
adults O
and O
a O
kid O
( O
including O
only O
two O
beers B-AS
for O
the O
adults O
) O
, O
and O
the O
only O
things O
worth O
eating O
were O
the O
raw O
oysters O
, O
information O
about O
which O
the O
staff B-AS
was O
not O
too O
sure O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
good O
, O
if O
a O
little O
slow O
, O
and O
the O
place O
was O
very O
crowded O
( O
which O
can O
be O
comforting O
, O
but O
on O
a O
date O
it O
may O
be O
hard O
with O
the O
constant O
noise B-AS
) O
. O

Intrigued O
by O
the O
ambience B-AS
of O
the O
restaurant O
, O
some O
friends O
and O
I O
decided O
to O
have O
dinner B-AS
at O
Paladar O
on O
Saturday O
night O
. O

For O
an O
appetizer B-AS
try O
the O
chicken B-AS
raviolis O
, O
and O
for O
dinner B-AS
try O
the O
beef B-AS
briolle I-AS
. O

The O
space B-AS
is O
small O
and O
they O
don O
' O
t O
take O
reservations O
, O
but O
go O
next O
door O
to O
the O
bar B-AS
while O
you O
wait O
and O
have O
some O
very O
yummy O
sakatini O
' O
s O
that O
are O
made O
with O
fresh O
fruit B-AS
. O

7A B-AS
is O
open O
24 O
/ O
7 O
and O
is O
great O
for O
lunch B-AS
, O
brunch B-AS
or O
a O
late O
night O
visit O
after O
partying O
all O
night O
. O

) O
While O
the O
location B-AS
and O
ambiance O
sure O
are O
nice O
, O
I O
found O
the O
price O
a O
bit O
expensive O
considering O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
food B-AS
was O
nothing O
spectacular O
. O

This O
restaurant O
has O
taken O
the O
trend O
of O
serving B-AS
tiny O
portions O
on O
oversized O
plates B-AS
to O
a O
new O
level O
. O

The O
bar B-AS
has O
a O
large O
selection B-AS
of O
beers B-AS
on O
tap B-AS
, O
bottles O
or O
cans O
. O

I O
had O
dinner B-AS
with O
5 O
friends O
at O
Blue O
Smoke O
last O
night O
and O
was O
totally O
impressed O
with O
the O
way O
the O
food B-AS
has O
developed O
. O

Came O
here O
with O
a O
date O
and O
immediately O
liked O
the O
room O
and O
nice O
bar B-AS
scene I-AS
even O
though O
we O
had O
a O
bit O
of O
a O
wait O
despite O
a O
reservation B-AS
. O

They O
are O
served O
with O
a O
free O
appetizer B-AS
and O
the O
portions O
are O
perfect O
for O
lunch B-AS
. O

The O
waitress B-AS
conveniently O
added O
in O
her O
tip O
into O
our O
bill O
, O
charged O
$ O
10 O
for O
each O
margarita B-AS
. O

Our O
waitress B-AS
left O
halfway O
through O
dinner B-AS
, O
without O
explanation O
, O
and O
was O
replaced O
by O
another O
waiter O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
good O
but O
nothing O
to O
write O
home O
about O
- O
the O
rack B-AS
of I-AS
lamb I-AS
was O
a O
bit O
too O
fatty O
. O

A O
very O
pretty O
setting O
to O
have O
a O
meal O
, O
but O
unfortunately O
the O
service B-AS
and O
food B-AS
don O
' O
t O
match O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
. O

Waiter B-AS
was O
a O
strange O
bird O
and O
when O
told O
we O
wanted O
to O
enjoy O
our O
dining B-AS
experience O
and O
not O
be O
rushed O
through O
dinner B-AS
, O
he O
assured O
us O
it O
takes O
30 O
minutes O
to O
get O
entrees B-AS
once O
food O
was O
ordered O
. O

When O
the O
bill B-AS
came O
, O
both O
appetizers B-AS
were O
charged O
even O
though O
we O
had O
one O
bite O
of O
the O
first O
and O
it O
should O
not O
have O
served B-AS
competely O
overcooked O
. O

Sit O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
, O
order O
a O
glass B-AS
of I-AS
wine I-AS
, O
and O
grab O
an O
appetizer B-AS
: O
they O
' O
ll O
also O
bring O
you O
olives O
, O
parmesan O
cheese O
, O
a O
huge O
loaf O
of O
delicious O
bread B-AS
and O
3 O
dipping O
sauces O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
better O
than O
the O
pizza B-AS
( O
if O
possible O
) O
, O
are O
the O
meatball B-AS
and O
the O
eggplant B-AS
parm I-AS
heros I-AS
. O

Although O
it O
lacks O
the O
patina O
of O
places O
like O
Peter B-AS
Luger O
' O
s O
and O
Sparks O
, O
it O
still O
has O
a O
steakhouse O
' O
s O
telltale O
wood O
paneling O
, O
chalkboard O
specials B-AS
and O
decorative O
wine B-AS
bottles I-AS
. O

The O
menu B-AS
is O
an O
exact O
replica O
of O
its O
sister O
location O
in O
New O
Mexico O
- O
right O
down O
to O
the O
Frito B-AS
Pie I-AS
( O
don O
' O
t O
knock O
it O
till O
you O
' O
ve O
tried O
) O
and O
a O
killer O
array O
of O
margaritas O
. O

The O
osso O
buco O
is O
to O
die O
for O
and O
my O
favorite O
appetizer B-AS
was O
the O
artichoke B-AS
served I-AS
on O
bed O
of O
frisee O
with O
a O
warm B-AS
poached I-AS
egg I-AS
topped I-AS
with I-AS
parmesan I-AS
cheese I-AS
. O

If O
coming O
to O
Tea O
and O
Anthipathy O
( O
yea O
u O
heard O
me O
) O
during O
conventional O
dining B-AS
hours O
, O
expect O
a O
good O
long O
wait B-AS
on O
the O
curb O
till O
tables O
open O
up O
. O

For O
entree B-AS
selections O
we O
had O
the O
chicken O
cacciatore O
, O
head O
on O
shrimp B-AS
( O
in O
a O
honey O
glaze O
) O
spectacular O
, O
mozzarella O
en O
carozza O
( O
a O
little O
bit O
on O
the O
fishy O
side O
due O
to O
the O
anchovies O
) O
and O
the O
sliced O
italian O
meats O
, O
sapprosota O
to O
die O
for O
. O

But O
what O
would O
have O
been O
a O
pleasant O
experience O
was O
spoiled O
by O
the O
attitude B-AS
and O
actions O
of O
the O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
and O
the O
management B-AS
. O

Why O
would O
anyone O
ever O
go O
here O
when O
the O
same O
food B-AS
( O
and O
menu B-AS
) O
is O
double O
the O
price B-AS
of O
Baba O
and O
Jaya O
in O
Chinatown O
. O

Taci O
then O
moved O
to O
NYU O
, O
to O
a O
space B-AS
as O
warm O
as O
an O
igloo O
, O
with O
an O
equally O
cold O
atmosphere B-AS
, O
an O
attempt O
at O
a O
more O
upscale O
menu B-AS
, O
and O
with O
all O
the O
charm O
of O
a O
pizza O
joint O
. O

I O
got O
a O
full O
1 O
/ O
2 O
chicken O
, O
4 O
ribs B-AS
and O
a O
decent O
sized O
pile O
of O
brisket B-AS
and O
pulled O
pork B-AS
with O
a O
corn O
muffin O
filled O
with O
actual O
corn O
. O

If O
you O
would O
like O
to O
charge O
us O
5 O
dollars O
for O
service B-AS
that O
would O
be O
fine O
, O
though O
comming O
from O
a O
restaurant O
where O
we O
buy O
a O
dessert B-AS
for O
a O
bithday O
I O
thinks O
it O
' O
s O
a O
bit O
cheap O
. O

The O
Food B-AS
Despite O
a O
menu B-AS
that O
seems O
larger O
than O
the O
restaurant O
, O
great O
care O
goes O
into O
the O
preparation O
of O
every O
dish B-AS
. O

However O
the O
manager B-AS
, O
who O
refused O
to O
come O
to O
our O
table B-AS
to O
discuss O
it O
, O
said O
we O
were O
wrong O
( O
through O
the O
poor O
waitress B-AS
) O
and O
would O
not O
replace O
our O
bottle O
. O

Our O
server B-AS
seemed O
to O
be O
new O
because O
he O
continually O
had O
to O
go O
back O
to O
the O
kitchen O
to O
check O
on O
menu B-AS
items O
. O

Thought O
we O
were O
going O
to O
have O
a O
winner O
from O
the O
pleasant O
person B-AS
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
phone O
when O
I O
called O
for O
our O
reservation B-AS
. O

The O
matre O
de O
ignored O
what O
I O
said O
about O
my O
girlfriend O
having O
to O
look O
for O
a O
waiter B-AS
to O
refill O
her O
glass O
( O
twice O
) O
, O
I O
mentioned O
about O
my O
rice B-AS
, O
he O
said O
, O
You O
should O
have O
spoken O
up O
. O

After O
confronting O
the O
counter B-AS
clerck O
he O
assured O
me O
the O
soups B-AS
would O
stay O
warm O
as O
long O
as O
I O
wasn O
' O
t O
walking O
20 O
minutes O
to O
my O
destination O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
eaten O
here O
a O
couple O
times O
and O
the O
food B-AS
is O
always O
good O
( O
jerk O
chix O
wings O
, O
fried B-AS
chicken I-AS
, O
meat O
loaf O
, O
etc O
) O
but O
the O
service O
is O
terrible O
. O

the O
service B-AS
was O
horrible O
then O
and O
the O
food B-AS
was O
decent O
. O

We O
were O
put O
on O
the O
wait B-AS
list I-AS
, O
seated O
in O
15 O
min O
after O
a O
quick O
drink O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
and O
had O
an O
incredibly O
entertaining O
waiter B-AS
and O
dined O
next O
to O
a O
few O
regulars O
who O
raved O
. O

As O
host B-AS
of O
the O
party O
with O
a O
full O
guestlisted O
group O
, O
I O
still O
had O
to O
wait O
online O
for O
20 O
minutes O
before O
anyone O
from O
the O
staff B-AS
would O
even O
look O
in O
my O
direction O
. O

went O
for O
dinner B-AS
with O
two O
friends O
and O
all O
of O
us O
were O
raving O
about O
our O
meals B-AS
- O
- O
the O
best O
steak B-AS
i O
' O
ve O
had O
in O
a O
long O
time O
, O
and O
the O
duck B-AS
and O
salmon B-AS
were O
also O
delicious O
. O

Casual O

- O
in O
service B-AS
with O
a O
menu B-AS
of O
burgers B-AS
, O
sandwiches B-AS
and O
more O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
spotty O
as O
a O
couple O
of O
drink B-AS
orders O
were O
forgotten O
and O
the O
waiter B-AS
didn O
' O
t O
really O
come O
to O
check O
on O
us O
. O

D O
, O
who O
can O
' O
t O
decide O
on O
a O
single O
dish B-AS
, O
the O
tapas B-AS
menu I-AS
allowed O
me O
to O
express O
my O
true O
culinary O
self O
. O

The O
recipe B-AS
uses I-AS
shrimp I-AS
with O
shell O
since O
they O
preserve O
the O
juice B-AS
much O
better O
and O
it O
just O
made O
me O
remember O
my O
childhood O
at O
the O
beach O
in O
Acapulco O
. O

Build O
your O
own O
pie O

Luckily O
, O
I O
made O
reservations B-AS
for O
our O
group O
or O
else O
it O
would O
have O
been O
a O
long O
wait B-AS
. O

Came O
recommended O
to O
us O
, O
but O
we O
found O
the O
food B-AS
to O
be O
so O
- O
so O
, O
the O
service O
good O
, O
but O
we O
were O
told O
we O
could O
not O
order O
desert O
since O
the O
table O
we O
were O
at O
had O
a O
reservation O
waiting B-AS
. O

We O
didn O
' O
t O
order O
- O
the O
waiter B-AS
just O
kept O
piling O
the O
food B-AS
in O
front O
of O
us O
. O

Denny O

a O

Grand B-AS

breakfast I-AS
- O
- O
and O
at O
a O
quarter O
of O
the O
price B-AS
( O
I O
paid O
$ O
21 O
w O
/ O
o O
tip B-AS
for O
b O
- O
fast O
- O
- O
I O
went O
back O
a O
second O
time O
, O
because O
the O
restaurant O
was O
highly O
touted O
and O
I O
thought O
the O
first O
bad O
experience O
was O
a O
fluke O
. O

The O
server B-AS
was O
dutiful O
yet O
insincere O
, O
the O
brunch B-AS
drinks I-AS
above O
average O
. O

For O
dinner B-AS
we O
decided O
to O
take O
our O
servers B-AS
advice O
and O
order O
several O
items O
to O
share O
. O

Then O
the O
menu B-AS
is O
all O
in O
Italian O
well O
I O
don O
' O
t O
speak O
Italian O
so O
it O
took O
forever O
for O
the O
waitress B-AS
to O
translate O
. O

The O
food O
is O
decent O
, O
too O
commercialized O
Italian B-AS
food I-AS
, O
and O
very O
verylarge O
portions B-AS
, O
which O
ca O
end O
up O
being O
very O
expensive O
if O
you O
are O
not O
up O
for O
sharing O
and O
ordering O
wisely B-AS
. O

Not O
being O
familiar O
with O
Vietnamese B-AS
cuisine I-AS
, O
we O
found O
the O
menu B-AS
descriptions O
very O
helpful O
. O

All O
of O
the O
dishes B-AS
we O
had O
were O
very O
good O
, O
but O
the O
fries B-AS
were O
a O
little O
on O
the O
salty O
side O
, O
which O
we O
actually O
didn O
' O
t O
mind O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
phenomenal O
- O
brought O
me O
back O
to O
Tuscany O
with O
that O
olive B-AS
oil I-AS
. O

Amazingly O
tasty O
cheese B-AS
drenched O
in O
oil B-AS
and O
soft O
yet O
crisp O
perfect O
dough B-AS
, O
who O
could O
ask O
for O
more O
? O

Brunch B-AS

I O
ordered O
the O
flounder O
special O
- O
the O
fish B-AS
was O
fresh O
but O
the O
dish B-AS
lacked O
flavor B-AS
. O

Their O
Korean O
menu O
was O
also O
equally O
impressive O
, O
A O
must O
try O
is O
the O
Kimchee O
cabbage O
pancakes B-AS
as O
an O
appetiser O
( O
the O
portions B-AS
were O
as O
big O
as O
an O
entree O
! O
) O

The O
waiter B-AS
told O
us O
that O
he O
had O
checked O
with O
the O
kitchen O
because O
he O
noticed O
that O
we O
had O
not O
gotten O
our O
dinners B-AS
and O
they O
said O
it O
would O
be O
out O
shortly O
, O
shouldn O
' O
t O
someone O
have O
said O
something O
to O
us O
? O

Our O
waiter B-AS
was O
confused O
and O
forgot O
an O
additional O
soda B-AS
when O
we O
asked O
for O
it O
. O

We O
were O
left O
to O
choose O
between O
boring O
salmon O
and O
chicken B-AS
entres O
or O
a O
duck B-AS
substitution I-AS
. O

Just O
expect O
to O
wait O
a O
good O
twenty O
minutes O
before O
they O
take O
your O
order O
( O
even O
when O
the O
restaurant O
is O
half O
empty O
) O
, O
you O
' O
ll O
have O
to O
ask O
at O
least O
5 O
waiters B-AS
and O
a O
manager O
for O
coffee B-AS
before O
they O
bring O
it O
to O
you O
and O
when O
they O
bring O
your O
orders O
out O
wrong O
, O
expect O
the O
manager O
to O
side O
with O
the O
chef B-AS
and O
not O
you O
. O

It O
is O
a O
nice O
room B-AS
with O
a O
cool O
bar B-AS
and O
you O
should O
stop O
in O
for O
a O
drink B-AS
and O
Tapas O
but O
dinner B-AS
was O
very O
weak O
! O
! O
! O
! O

The O
calamari B-AS
salad I-AS
was O
great O
while O
the O
lamb B-AS
ribs I-AS
were O
fat O
, O
fattier O
and O
fattiest O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
the O
bar B-AS
is O
not O
very O
well O
laid O
out O
, O
its O
narrow O
design B-AS
makes O
it O
hard O
to O
meet O
a O
group O
for O
drinks B-AS
. O

Our O
waiter B-AS
was O
completely O
unfamiliar O
with O
the O
menu B-AS
and O
did O
not O
bother O
to O
tell O
us O
that O
they O
were O
out O
of O
several O
items O
( O
even O
though O
we O
arrived O
at O
7 O
pm O
on O
a O
Saturday O
night O
! O
) O

The O
music O
was O
a O
bit O
loud O
but O
the O
song O
selection B-AS
was O
great O
, O
so O
we O
blew O
off O
desert O
and O
had O
another O
round O
of O
drinks B-AS
at O
the O
bar B-AS
. O

The O
waitress B-AS
let O
us O
taste O
three O
wines O
before O
deciding O
( O
we O
were O
only O
ordering O
glasses O
) O
and O
then O
we O
chose O
to O
eat O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
( O
same O
menu B-AS
) O
since O
it O
was O
so O
comfortable O
. O

You O
get O
three O
courses B-AS
for O
$ O
20 O
at O
lunch B-AS
and O
the O
amount B-AS
of I-AS
food I-AS
is O
more O
than O
enough O
for O
anyone O
to O
leave O
feeling O
fully O
satisfied O
. O

A O
+ O
for O
the O
food B-AS
but O
the O
wait B-AS
staffs I-AS
need O
to O
educate O
themselves O
better O
. O

We O
decided O
to O
get O
out O
of O
there O
and O
go O
to O
a O
safe O
place O
with O
bigger O
portions B-AS
and O
normal O
food B-AS
. O

the O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
looks O
like O
were O
doing O
us O
a O
favor O
giving O
us O
service B-AS
and O
two O
loud O
guys O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
made O
my O
evening O
with O
my O
wife O
quiet O
miserable O
. O

The O
tables B-AS
were O
too O
close O
together O
, O
the O
food B-AS
wasn O
' O
t O
impressive O
, O
and O
the O
service B-AS
was O
often O
times O
completely O
missing O
- O
waiting O
45 O
minutes O
between O
ending O
dinner B-AS
and O
being O
asked O
about O
dessert B-AS
is O
not O
what O
a O
restaurant O
of O
this O
caliber O
should O
be O
all O
about O
. O

unbeknownst O
to O
the O
three O
of O
us O
, O
the O
hostess B-AS
made O
note O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
i O
was O
celebrating O
my O
b O
- O
day O
after O
a O
member O
of O
my O
dinner B-AS
party O
made O
a O
very O
brief O
reference O
to O
it O
as O
we O
were O
seated O
. O

Enjoy O
the O
food B-AS
, O
because O
it O
is O
remarkable O
, O
but O
don O
' O
t O
be O
too O
willing O
to O
be O
gratuitis O
to O
a O
server B-AS
that O
does O
not O
deserve O
it O

of O
garlicky O
marinara O
, O
comes O
with O
a O
side O
of O
spaghetti B-AS
. O

The O
service O
sucked O
- O
- O
we O
didn O
' O
t O
get O
bread B-AS
, O
our O
eggs O
were O
cold O
, O
and O
their O
brunch B-AS
prix I-AS
fix O
does O
not O
include O
an O
alcoholic O
drink B-AS
. O

When O
a O
meal B-AS
starts O
with O
bad O
bread B-AS
, O
you O
know O
you O
' O
re O
in O
for O
a O
long O
night B-AS
. O

Most O
dishes B-AS
are O
smothered O
in O
melted O
cheese B-AS
or O
merely O
mediocre O
; O
flan B-AS
is O
flat O
and O
pedestrian O
, O
drenched O
in O
tasteless O
sugar B-AS
syrup O
; O
and O
even O
its O
supposedly O
best O
feature O
- O
the O
margarita B-AS
- O
is O
a O
hit O
- O
or O
- O
miss O
affair O
. O

It O
appears O
to O
be O
a O
charming O
french B-AS
outdoor I-AS
bistro I-AS
, O
and O
the O
food O
wasn O
' O
t O
bad O
, O
but O
the O
waiters B-AS
were O
clearly O
tired O
of O
dealing O
with O
tourists O
, O
and O
didn O
' O
t O
handle O
us O
with O
care O
. O

I O
felt O
the O
chef B-AS
was O
using O
truffles B-AS
too O
much O
just O
to O
cover O
up O
mediocre O
food B-AS
. O

To O
finish O
, O
the O
cost B-AS
of O
the O
dinner B-AS
was O
over O
- O
priced O
. O

In O
Short O
The O
few O
window B-AS
- I-AS
front I-AS
tables I-AS
fill O
quickly O
, O
but O
most O
customers O
prefer O
not O
to O
linger O
in O
the O
nondescript O
space B-AS
, O
in O
favor O
of O
taking O
their O
Thai O
food O
to O
go O
, O
or O
phoning O
in O
for O
delivery O
. O

On O
the O
top O
of O
everything O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
dinner B-AS
the O
waiter B-AS
gave O
us O
the O
wrong O
check B-AS
. O

However O
, O
you O
don O
' O
t O
even O
really O
need O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
because O
the O
daily B-AS
specials I-AS
are O
always O
tempting O
and O
delicious O
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
conserative O
types O
craving O
simpler O
things O
like O
grilled O
chicken O
or O
salmon B-AS
probably O
would O
not O
appreciate O
Tabla O
' O
s O
distinctive O
and O
unusual O
menu B-AS
. O

The O
staff B-AS
were O
very O
friendly O
, O
the O
prices B-AS
were O
relatively O
average O
, O
not O
bad O
, O
and O
the O
food B-AS
was O
great O
. O

It O
is O
expensice O
, O
but O
the O
portions B-AS
are O
big O
and O
include O
a O
side O
, O
salad B-AS
, O
nan B-AS
and O
rice B-AS
along O
with O
your O
main O
meal O
! O

After O
dining B-AS
there O
twice O
, O
all O
the O
waiters B-AS
will O
remember O
you O
and O
what O
you O
ordered O
the O
last O
time O
you O
were O
there O
! O

Comfort B-AS
standbys O
- O
- O
including O
bacon O
- O
wrapped O
meat O
loaf O
and O
barbecued B-AS
ribs I-AS
, O
and O
upscaled O
interpretations B-AS
- O
- O
like O
tuna O
club O
made O
with O
wasabi B-AS
mayo I-AS
, O
share O
space O
with O
brunch O
favorites O
( O
Belgian O
waffles O
, O
fluffy O
buttermilk O
pancakes O
and O
wrecked O
eggs O
, O
or O
tofu O
) O
. O

It O
might O
be O
the O
best O
sit O
down O
food B-AS
I O
' O
ve O
had O
in O
the O
area O
, O
so O
if O
you O
are O
going O
to O
the O
upright O
citizen O
brigade O
, O
or O
the O
garden B-AS
, O
it O
could O
be O
just O
the O
place O
for O
you O
. O

The O
Scene B-AS
Unpolished O
but O
cozy O
, O
with O
red O
walls B-AS
, O
arty O
sconces O
and O
deep O
, O
comfortable O
booths O
, O
Raga O
calls O
little O
attention O
to O
itself O
. O

This O
is O
the O
place O
to O
come O
for O
coffee B-AS
and O
dessert B-AS
; O
they O
have O
an O
enormous O
and O
decadent O
selection B-AS
of I-AS
cakes I-AS
, O
pies B-AS
, O
and O
other O
things O
involving O
chocolate B-AS
. O

The O
service B-AS
is O
a O
bit O
slow O
, O
but O
harkens O
back O
to O
my O
years O
growing O
up O
in O
Napoli O
, O
Italy O
where O
things O
are O
not O
rushed O
and O
when O
you O
sit O
down O
for O
dinner B-AS
the O
table O
is O
yours O
all O
night O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
bland O
and O
non O
- O
descript O
and O
the O
service B-AS
is O
fine O
. O

The O
Scene B-AS
Tucked O
away O
on O
the O
second O
floor O
of O
a O
small O
, O
nondescript O
Madison O
Avenue O
building O
, O
Caviar B-AS
Russe O
feels O
more O
like O
a O
private O
club O
than O
a O
restaurant O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
good O
, O
the O
waiter B-AS
was O
a O
little O
flip O
, O
but O
we O
can O
deal O
with O
that O
. O

Meals B-AS
generally O
begin O
in O
a O
pub O
- O
food O
vein O
, O
with O
appetizers B-AS
like O
featherweight O
, O
perfectly O
salted B-AS
fried I-AS
clams I-AS
and O
brown B-AS
sugar I-AS
- I-AS
lacquered I-AS
ribs I-AS
that O
are O
good O
enough O
to O
take O
on O
any O
barbecue O
joint O
in O
the O
city O
. O

Waiter B-AS
ignored O
us O
, O
never O
asked O
if O
we O
needed O
anything O
, O
never O
received O
a O
dessert B-AS
menu I-AS
or O
asked O
if O
we O
wanted O
coffee B-AS
, O
or O
even O
the O
check B-AS
. O

when O
someone O
from O
our O
table O
of O
5 O
asked O
the O
waitress B-AS
for O
refill O
on O
water B-AS
, O
she O
comes O
back O
and O
fills O
only O
that O
person O
' O
s O
glass O
, O
leaving O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
table O
with O
almost O
empty O
glasses B-AS
. O

The O
last O
three O
times O
I O
' O
ve O
called O
( O
in O
addition O
to O
asking O
me O
to O
wait O
for O
a O
long O
time O
before O
taking O
my O
order O
) O
, O
they O
' O
ve O
given O
me O
grief O
about O
asking O
for O
delivery O
even O
though O
my O
address O
is O
clearly O
within O
the O
map O
printed O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
just O
because O
the O
delivery B-AS
guy I-AS
gets O
mad O
if O
he O
has O
to O
go O
out O
of O
his O
way O
. O

Food B-AS
is O
mediocre O
, O
except O
for O
Mushroom B-AS
Custard I-AS
and O
Foie O
Gras O
in O
Fire O
Ice O
. O

The O
prices B-AS
did O
not O
reflect O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
meal B-AS
. O

Among O
the O
entrees B-AS
, O
choose O
the O
stellar B-AS
mole I-AS
- O
- O
deep O
, O
thick O
and O
chocolatey O
- O
- O
blanketing O
tender O
chicken O
or O
poured O
over O
a O
chicken O
enchilada O
rather O
than O
the O
dry O
arroz O
con O
pollo O
. O

When O
the O
food B-AS
came O
, O
it O
was O
almost O
good O
, O
but O
the O
lack O
of O
AC O
, O
bad O
service B-AS
, O
and O
overall O
apathetic O
staff B-AS
, O
from O
the O
HOST B-AS
, O
to O
the O
MANAGER B-AS
to O
the O
WAITER O
, O
ruined O
the O
experience O
. O

A O
few O
years O
ago O
I O
would O
have O
rated O
it O
much O
higher O
, O
but O
now O
- O
with O
other O
better O
choices O
such O
as O
Candle O
Cafe O
, O
Good O
Health O
Cafe O
and O
others O
, O
the O
dated O
menu B-AS
, O
crowded O
atmosphere B-AS
are O
spacey O
service O
is O
not O
the O
greatest O
choice O
. O

I O
think O
they O
just O
tried O
to O
get O
a O
little O
too O
creative O
with O
the O
menu B-AS
and O
actually O
ended O
up O
losing O
flavor B-AS
in O
some O
of O
the O
dishes B-AS
. O

The O
place O
looks O
like O
the O
inside O
of O
a O
factory O
, O
with O
its O
steel O
drums O
, O
over O
- O
amped O
A O
/ O
C O
and O
hard O
wooden O
benches O
, O
and O
the O
industrial O
decor O
seeps O
into O
overly O
streamlined O
menu B-AS
and O
passionless O
food B-AS
. O

When O
I O
requested O
a O
specific O
beer O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
the O
waiter B-AS
said O
they O
were O
all O
out O
of O
that O
one O
and O
kept O
pushing O
the O
only O
available O
beer O
, O
which O
I O
didn O
' O
t O
want O
. O

About O
the O
food O
we O
had O
a O
little O
difilculty O
keeping O
the O
orders O
straight O
, O
the O
menu B-AS
has O
too O
many O
choices O
, O
but O
the O
server B-AS
was O
very O
helpul O
and O
suggested O
de O
paella O
valenciana O
which O
was O
extremele O
delicious O
. O

Mixed B-AS
drinks I-AS
were O
Casino O
Quality O
we O
weren O
' O
t O
sure O
if O
the O
sides B-AS
on I-AS
our O
tables B-AS
were O
left O
from O
the O
previous O
diners B-AS
, O
but O
when O
our O
steaks B-AS
( O
Only O
one O
choice O
on O
the O
menu O
) O
arrived O
. O

The O
Kitchen B-AS
is O
only O
separated O
from O
its O
patrons O
by O
glass O
is O
immaculate O
and O
the O
service B-AS
is O
undeniable O
heartfelt O
. O

The O
food B-AS
came O
cold O
and O
a O
sauce B-AS
that O
came O
with O
one O
of O
the O
dishes B-AS
had O
developed O
a O
skin O
. O

WHile O
the O
seafood B-AS
by O
the O
pound O
was O
the O
freshest O
I O
' O
ve O
had O
in O
a O
while O
, O
I O
was O
pleasantly O
surprized O
at O
the O
other O
entrees B-AS
available O
on O
the O
menu O
- O
- O
Delightfully O
presented O
! O

The O
spacious O
bar O
, O
with O
its O
own O
menu B-AS
of O
small O
plates B-AS
and O
a O
lengthy O
list O
of O
wines B-AS
by I-AS
the I-AS
glass I-AS
, O
is O
a O
boon O
to O
single O
diners O
. O

Specials B-AS
are O
likely O
to O
encompass O
such O
exotica O
as O
wild O
Scottish O
venison O
and O
free O
- O
range O
Australian O
lamb B-AS
, O
or O
seasonal O

hot I-AS
mango I-AS

and O
greens B-AS
hits O
all O
the O
right O
flavor B-AS
notes I-AS

The O
food O
was O
a O
meal B-AS
I O
could O
find O
anywhere O
else O
in O
the O
city O
for O
a O
better O
price B-AS
. O

Overall O
, O
it O
' O
s O
a O
good O
place O
to O
have O
dinner B-AS
and O
hang O
out O
if O
you O
do O
not O
mind O
waiting B-AS
for O
food O
, O
weird O
music B-AS
and O
rude O
manager O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
unbelievably O
on O
target O
down O
to O
the O
smallest O
detail O
; O
our O
waiter B-AS
invited O
us O
to O
sample O
a O
new O
desert O
under O
consideration O
for O
their O
menu B-AS
and O
a O
new O
line O
of O
ice O
wines B-AS
. O

And O
for O
families O
they O
have O
high O
chairs B-AS
and O
waiters B-AS
were O
really O
nice O
to O
my O
kid O
. O

Once O
seated O
we O
were O
greeted O
by O
a O
very O
rude O
waiter B-AS
who O
threw O
menus B-AS
at O
us O
and O
then O
snatched O
them O
away O
as O
we O
were O
ordering O
. O

A O
regular O
Japanese B-AS
menu I-AS
is O
available O
for O
those O
who O
would O
like O
to O
experience O
traditional O
Japanese B-AS
cuisine I-AS
. O

There O
are O
1 O
or O
2 O
vegetarian B-AS
dishes I-AS
, O
but O
the O
sides O
platter O
has O
a O
bit O
of O
everything O
, O
so O
you O
get O
the O
full O
flavor O
of O
Latin B-AS
American I-AS
food I-AS
. O

I O
had O
blackened O
salmon B-AS
and O
my O
fiance O
had O
chicken B-AS
marsala I-AS
. O

Drinks B-AS
took O
a O
while O
, O
and O
after O
a O
few O
rounds O
pf O
the O
we O
' O
re O
sorry O
, O
we O
don O
' O
t O
have O
this O
bottle O
sir B-AS
routine I-AS
. O

i O
mean O
the O
place B-AS
was O
empty O
and O
it O
seemed O
to O
take O
for O
ever O
to O
get O
food B-AS
, O
drink B-AS
or O
the O
check O
. O

The O
journey O
may O
be O
long O
and O
the O
wait B-AS
may O
be O
longer O
, O
but O
there O
is O
nothing O
that O
could O
keep O
me O
from O
this O
pizza B-AS
. O

Our O
waiter B-AS
was O
pretty O
much O
non O
- O
existent O
and O
when O
he O
did O
come O
to O
our O
table B-AS
he O
practically O
tossed O
our O
plates B-AS
and O
wine O
glasses O
in O
front O
of O
us O
. O

While O
the O
environment B-AS
is O
still O
fun O
and O
diverse O
, O
the O
food B-AS
quality I-AS
has O
been O
sliding O
lately O
. O

Our O
waiter B-AS
said O
3 O
words O
to O
us O
, O
wisked O
away O
our O
food B-AS
as O
we O
were O
finishing O
, O
and O
the O
maitre B-AS
' O
d O
could O
not O
take O
his O
eyes O
off O
our O
table B-AS
waiting I-AS
for O
us O
to O
leave O
. O

Its O
definitely O
recommended O
to O
make O
a O
reservation B-AS
on O
the O
weekends O
, O
since O
its O
difficult O
to O
walk O
- O
in O
and O
get O
a O
table B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
pretty O
good O
, O
but O
a O
little O
flavorless O
and O
the O
portions B-AS
very O
small O
, O
including O
dessert O
. O

The O
food B-AS
and O
decor B-AS
is O
above O
average O
, O
but O
it O
is O
clear O
the O
restaurant O
has O
bad O
management B-AS
and O
service B-AS
. O

One O
of O
my O
favorite O
places B-AS
to O
get O
a O
cup B-AS
of I-AS
tea I-AS
or O
to O
have O
a O
casual O
brunch B-AS
with O
the O
newspaper O
. O

There O
were O
three O
parties B-AS
of O
two O
standing O
in O
the O
front O
entrance O
looking O
like O
bumbling O
idiots O
while O
not O
a O
single O
host B-AS
, O
waiter B-AS
, O
or O
manager O
attended O
to O
us O
. O

One O
of O
my O
friends O
told O
them O
it O
was O
my O
birthday O
and O
the O
staff B-AS
relally O
surprised O
me O
when O
their O
came O
to O
me O
singing O
with O
the O
mexican B-AS
hats O
and O
a O
dessert O
with O
a O
candle O
on O
it O
. O

I O
am O
not O
good O
with O
using O
chopsticks B-AS
and O
asked O
for O
a O
fork O
, O
instead O
the O
owner B-AS
insisted O
that O
I O
try O
using O
a O
chopstick O
an O
made O
me O
an O
easy O
- O
to O
- O
use O
chop O
stick O
right O
there O
on O
the O
spot O
! O

If O
you O
want O
to O
have O
fresh O
grill B-AS
fish I-AS
served I-AS
just O
with O
virgin B-AS
olive I-AS
oil I-AS
and O
lemon O
Telly O
' O
s O
Taverna O
is O
the O
place O
for O
you O
. O

After O
asking O
several O
different O
people O
find O
our O
waiter B-AS
, O
he O
returned O
to O
say O
he O
couldn O
' O
t O
find O
any O
wine B-AS
and O
begged O
us O
to O
order O
sake O
instead O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
they O
lack O
basic O
ammenities O
like O
a O
toaster B-AS
, O
and O
the O
decor B-AS
was O
shabby O
, O
at O
best O
. O

The O
table O
next O
to O
us O
recommended O
that O
share O
because O
the O
portions B-AS
are O
big O
( O
we O
split O
two O
entrees B-AS
) O
The O
food O
was O
so O
good O
I O
wish O
that O
there O
was O
some O
left O
over O
to O
take O
home O
for O
the O
next O
day O
. O

so O
back O
to O
the O
Napoleon B-AS
was O
pretty O
yamie O
but O
over O
deep O
fried B-AS
. O

The O
owner B-AS
walks O
around O
barking O
at O
his O
employees B-AS
every O
chance O
he O
gets O
, O
and O
makes O
everyone O
- O
- O
- O
- O
customers O
and O
staff B-AS

nervous O
. O

This O
is O
not O
haute O
cuisine B-AS
, O
but O
that O
' O
part O
of O
what O
I O
love O
about O
it O
- O
it O
has O
an O
honest O
, O
intimate O
feel B-AS
with O
no O
pretensions O
, O
just O
like O
eating O
in O
an O
Italian O
family O
' O
s O
home O
. O

The O
hostess B-AS
was O
snooty O
since O
we O
did O
not O
have O
a O
reservation O
but O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
dining B-AS
experience O
amply O
made O
up O
for O
it O
. O

The O
hostess B-AS
had O
us O
wait O
in O
the O
bar B-AS
while O
our O
table O
was O
set O
up O
and O
we O
ordered O
what O
had O
to O
be O
the O
best O
mojitos B-AS
in O
the O
city O
. O

The O
problem O
is O
that O
if O
you O
want O
anything O
to O
continue O
the O
meal O
, O
if O
you O
need O
an O
extra O
minute O
to O
go O
over O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
or O
if O
, O
horrors O
, O
you O
want O
the O
check O
, O
you O
might O
be O
in O
for O
a O
lengthy O
wait B-AS
. O

I O
have O
never O
tried O
anything O
else O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
the O
burgers B-AS
are O
so O
good O
. O

The O
shrimp B-AS
and I-AS
lobster I-AS
bisques I-AS
are O
very O
good O
, O
but O
serverd O
in O
styrofoam O
cups O
which O
will O
affect O
the O
taste B-AS
if O
not O
eaten O
quickly O
. O

The O
hostess B-AS
told O
me O
she O
could O
accomodate O
my O
group O
without O
a O
reservation B-AS
but O
we O
ended O
up O
waiting O
nearly O
an O
hour O
and O
were O
seated O
in O
the O
smallest O
cramped O
area B-AS
. O

From O
soups O
( O
love O
the O
pumpkin B-AS
corn I-AS
bisque I-AS
) O
, O
to O
sandwiches B-AS
( O
gilled O
cheese O
is O
my O
favorite O
) O
, O
to O
the O
hot B-AS
food I-AS
that O
' O
s O
mostly O
asian O
influenced O
, O
and O
salads B-AS
that O
even O
include O
seared O
tuna B-AS
, O
there O
' O
s O
something O
for O
everyone O
. O

The O
portions B-AS
are O
not O
huge O
, O
but O
they O
do O
include O
an O
alcoholic O
beverage O
or O
fresh B-AS
juice I-AS
, O
so O
that O
made O
up O
for O
it O
. O

Got O
a O
table O
during O
restaurant O
week O
for O
lunch B-AS
and O
the O
service B-AS
was O
cordial O
, O
if O
slower O
than O
usual O
. O

But O
despite O
that O
our O
dinner B-AS
took O
far O
too O
long O
to O
be O
served B-AS
. O

We O
were O
here O
for O
lunch B-AS
and O
were O
seated B-AS
promptly O
in O
the O
bright O
, O
comfortable O
dining O
room O
. O

Service B-AS
: O
Below O
Average O
, O
the O
staff B-AS
joked O
stood O
around O
in O
the O
dinning O
room B-AS
joking O
around O
with O
each O
other O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
great O
and O
I O
found O
it O
to O
be O
fresh O
and O
the O
prices B-AS
are O
below O
to O
average O
compared O
to O
other O
Greek O
Restaurants O
. O

The O
waitress B-AS
was O
slow O
and O
had O
to O
ask O
the O
kitchen O
first O
every O
time O
we O
asked O
her O
about O
anything O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
. O

Lovely O
place B-AS
with O
the O
kind O
of O
Chinese O
food O
I O
like O
- O
- O
clean O
presentation O
, O
sizeable O
menu B-AS
, O
and O
a O
bit O
of O
a O
French O
twist B-AS
. O

The O
baked B-AS
goods I-AS
are O
all O
pretty O
good O
, O
though O
the O
bagels B-AS
are O
a O
touch O
stale O
and O
dry O
. O

The O
guacamole B-AS
was O
below O
average O
compared O
to O
any O
other O
decent O
Mexican B-AS
restaurant I-AS
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
never O
came O
back O
to O
check O
on O
us O
or O
refill O
coffee B-AS
, O
he O
got O
one O
of O
the O
orders O
wrong O
, O
and O
we O
both O
left O
wondering O
what O
we O
were O
going O
to O
eat O
when O
we O
got O
home O
. O

After O
making O
reservations O
1 O
month O
ahead O
, O
they O
sent O
us O
to O
the O
bar B-AS
when O
we O
arrived O
, O
you O
know O
to O
get O
you O
out O
some O
extra O
bucks O
because O
they O
had O
available O
tables B-AS
at O
the O
moment O
. O

Enjoyed O
a O
very O
nice O
Caesar B-AS
Salad I-AS
while O
my O
wife O
had O
arugula B-AS
and O
goat B-AS
cheese I-AS
. O

Wish O
the O
Greenwich O
street O
location O
had O
more O
seating B-AS
like O
their O
2nd O
Ave O
location O
, O
because O
one O
invariably O
leaves O
it O
smelling O
of O
grease B-AS
. O

On O
the O
menu B-AS
says O
Free O
delivery B-AS
( O
Minimun O
order O
$ O
10 O
) O
but O
I O
was O
charged O
a O
couple O
of O
dollars O
on O
both O
opportunities O
. O

I O
got O
fed O
up O
waiting B-AS
that O
I O
went O
to O
get O
the O
check O
and O
paid O
for O
it O
at O
the O
counter B-AS
where O
my O
waitor O
was O
busy O
flirting O
with O
the O
cashier O
. O

The O
four O
of O
us O
were O
seated O
in O
the O
outdoors B-AS
patio I-AS
( O
not O
requested O
) O
and O
suffered O
through O
a O
muddled O
menu B-AS
, O
indifferent O
food O
, O
a O
below O
average O
waiter B-AS
, O
as O
well O
as O
excessive O
noise B-AS
, O
wind O
and O
cold O
. O

Overall O
, O
cute O
place B-AS
with O
poor O
service B-AS
, O
and O
even O
worse O
food B-AS
. O

The O
decor B-AS
is O
like O
a O
brasserie O
and O
has O
a O
fairly O
laid O
- O
back O
atmosphere B-AS
. O

The O
SUM O
IT O
: O
Dim B-AS
sum I-AS
standard O
fair O
, O
noodles B-AS
ok O
, O
other O
dishes O
ok O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
didn O
' O
t O
like O
was O
the O
bread B-AS
that O
came O
to O
the O
table B-AS
before O
dinner B-AS
. O

Beautifull O
people O
, O
and O
a O
dj B-AS
that O
was O
making O
me O
just O
want O
to O
stay O
and O
drink B-AS
more O
! O

The O
Dinner B-AS
seating I-AS
scheme O
is O
unintelligible O
with O
many O
tables O
left O
empty O
while O
guests O
and O
servers B-AS
jab O
and O
jostle O
in O
the O
narrow O
entrance O
; O
most O
of O
the O
former O
not O
informed O
of O
the O
restaurant O
policy O
that O
allows O
you O
to O
place O
your O
name O
on O
the O
dinner B-AS
list I-AS
and O
then O
return O
hours O
later O
to O
claim O
your O
reservation B-AS
. O

The O
owners B-AS
Pat I-AS
and O
John O
are O
very O
friendly O
and O
can O
often O
sit O
and O
have O
a O
beer B-AS
with O
you O
. O

I O
had O
the O
first O
pasta B-AS
listed O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
and O
it O
left O
me O
craving O
the O
taste O
again O
for O
days O
after O
. O

Coffee B-AS
served I-AS
without O
sugar O
/ O
milk O
and O
took O
more O
than O
10 O
min O
to O
catch O
the O
waiter B-AS
to O
ask O
for O
it O
. O

The O
host B-AS
greeted O
us O
warmly O
and O
eagerly O
and O
the O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
was O
just O
as O
receptive O
. O

Despite O
almost O
flawless O
service B-AS
, O
I O
had O
my O
birthday O
there O
for O
a O
party O
of O
15 O
and O
we O
were O
given O
a O
private B-AS
area I-AS
on O
the O
top O
floor B-AS
, O
which O
was O
so O
cold O
, O
we O
had O
to O
keep O
our O
jackets O
on O
throughout O
the O
entire O
meal B-AS
. O

I O
had O
dinner B-AS
here O
with O
a O
few O
friends O
recently O
, O
and O
while O
I O
must O
admit O
that O
the O
food B-AS
and O
service B-AS
was O
okay O
, O
the O
prices B-AS
simply O
did O
not O
match O
the O
environment O
and O
cuisine B-AS
. O

( O
they O
should O
if O
you O
are O
willing O
to O
spend O
$ O
400 O
on O
dinner B-AS
) O
if O
the O
owner B-AS
of O
this O
restaurant O
saw O
how O
the O
staff B-AS
was O
acting O
he O
would O
fire O
ALL O
of O
them O
. O

while O
I O
think O
the O
menu B-AS
could O
use O
better O
appetizers B-AS
all O
of O
the O
main O
courses O
are O
DELICIOUS O
- O
also O
the O
service O
is O
so O
much O
better O
than O
the O
ratings B-AS
. O

There O
is O
a O
long O
bar O
area O
wide O
enough O
to O
accommodate O
large O
crowds B-AS
, O
large O
screen O
tv O
' O
s O
on O
the O
walls O
to O
view O
games O
, O
but O
not O
that O
do O
not O
dominate O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
, O
and O
up O
front O
there O
is O
a O
large O
lounge B-AS
are O
with O
several O
booths O
and O
a O
working O
fireplace O
. O

The O
decor B-AS
isn O
' O
t O
the O
best O
and O
the O
place B-AS
is O
very O
modest O
, O
but O
if O
you O
' O
re O
around O
Ditmars O
Blvd O
. O

The O
staff B-AS
had O
apparently O
booked O
the O
room B-AS
for O
2 O
groups O
with O
a O
30 O
minute O
overlap B-AS
. O

Items O
are O
a O
la B-AS
carte I-AS
, O
so O
if O
you O
order O
lamb B-AS
chops I-AS
, O
that O
' O
s O
all O
you O
get O
. O

Beautiful O
Chilled B-AS
seafood I-AS
platters I-AS
( O
and O
I O
don O
' O
t O
eat O
shellfish O
) O
that O
would O
make O
a O
Kosher B-AS
person O
convert O
! O

The O
food B-AS
is O
just O
ok O
, O
not O
at O
all O
worth O
having O
to O
put O
up O
with O
the O
disgusting O
staff B-AS
, O
the O
manager O
/ O
owner O
in O
particular O
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
was O
rude O
to O
my O
friend O
when O
she O
asked O
for O
a O
small O
plate O
to O
share O
an O
appetizer B-AS
. O

The O
chips O
and O
salsa O
are O
good O
, O
but O
the O
meal B-AS
is O
not O
worth O
the O
wait B-AS
. O

Oh O
, O
you O
should O
have O
seen O
the O
look O
on O
the O
waiter B-AS
' O
s O
face O
when O
we O
told O
him O
we O
didn O
' O
t O
want O
any O
coffee O
after O
the O
meal B-AS
. O

They O
expanded O
the O
seating B-AS
with O
a O
cozy O
new O
back O
section O
, O
added O
some O
great O
new B-AS
dishes I-AS
( O
I O
had O
the O
most O
fantastic O
j B-AS
erk I-AS
Shrimp I-AS
and O
exciting O
maize O
crusted O
salmon O
) O
but O
kept O
everything O
that O
was O
good O
( O
amazing O
staff B-AS
and O
Mac O
Jack O
! O
) O

The O
service O
was O
not O
great O
, O
the O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
were O
not O
clear O
on O
the O
ingredients B-AS
and O
or O
preparation O
details O
of O
the O
meals B-AS
. O

Food B-AS
: O
Bland O
and O
unoriginal O
, O
despite O
the O
creative O
writing O
in O
their O
menu B-AS
. O

Upon O
his O
arrival O
the O
staff B-AS
checked O
in O
his O
bags O
and O
put O
them O
in O
the O
storage B-AS
room I-AS
, O
but O
when O
my O
bf O
asked O
for O
a O
check O
- O
in O
ticket O
, O
the O
host B-AS
refused O
to O
give O
one O
and O
threw O
the O
bags O
back O
at O
us O
. O

Odd O
, O
traditional O
and O
clashing O
decor B-AS
will O
only O
detract O
from O
your O
experience O
if O
the O
square O
box B-AS
layout O
or O
perma O
- O
draft O
through O
the O
pane O
glass O
door O
doesn O
' O
t O
get O
you O
first O
. O

After O
all O
that O
, O
it O
is O
average O
food B-AS
at O
best O
with O
huge O
bill B-AS
at O
the O
end O
. O

The O
outdoor B-AS
garden I-AS
more O
than O
doubles O
the O
dining B-AS
space I-AS
and O
is O
tented O
in O
winter O
. O

But O
even O
on O
New O
Years O
, O
when O
they O
were O
busy O
, O
the O
owners B-AS
took O
the O
time O
out O
to O
visit O
our O
table O
frequently O
, O
even O
pouring O
us O
drinks B-AS
herself O
from O
her O
own O
creations O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
very O
good O
but O
portions B-AS
were O
small O
. O

Both O
times O
, O
however O
, O
I O
endured O
lazy O
service B-AS
, O
old O
bread B-AS
, O
overcooked O
pasta B-AS
and O
sour O
wine O
w O
/ O
my O
meal B-AS
. O

I O
ate O
here O
once O
for O
dinner B-AS
, O
and O
once O
for O
brunch B-AS
, O
and O
both O
times O
I O
was O
very O
impressed O
with O
the O
quality B-AS
and O
uniqueness O
of O
the O
food B-AS
. O

Waitress B-AS
kept O
trying O
to O
get O
us O
to O
order O
more O
drinks B-AS
while O
apologizing O
but O
wouldn O
' O
t O
even O
bring O
bread B-AS
to O
keep O
us O
from O
starving O
. O

They O
may O
love O
the O
wacky O
/ O
tacky O
decore B-AS
, O
the O
overly O
gracious O
host O
, O
Gus O
, O
and O
his O
staff B-AS
, O
the O
loads O
of O
freebies O
( O
oranges O
, O
cookies O
, O
lollies B-AS
and O
wet O
naps O
) O
, O
but O
the O
food B-AS
is O
just O
mediocre O
. O

After O
some O
good O
food O
and O
spotty O
service B-AS
, O
my O
friends O
and O
I O
were O
surprised O
to O
get O
a O
bill B-AS
that O
had O
a O
20 O
% O
tip O
included O
post O
- O
tax O
. O

Got O
2 O
apps O
that O
were O
delicious O
and O
the O
bartender B-AS
made O
some O
strong O
drinks B-AS
, O
he O
could O
have O
at O
least O
smiled O
said O
my O
girl O
, O
but O
his O
service B-AS
was O
great O
with O
our O
orders B-AS
. O

Everyone O
around O
me O
was O
eating O
stuff O
that O
wasn O
' O
t O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
and O
looked O
tastier O
, O
but O
the O
waitress B-AS
didn O
' O
t O
bother O
to O
suggest O
any O
of O
these O
things O
, O
even O
when O
asked O
for O
suggestions O
. O

The O
Scene B-AS
Upstairs O
in O
a O
narrow O
, O
handsome O
but O
oddly O
shaped O
space B-AS
, O
this O
serene O
, O
refined O
restaurant O
caters O
to O
a O
mostly O
business O
- O
oriented O
crowd O
that O
, O
auspiciously O
one O
presumes O
, O
is O
predominantly O
Japanese O
. O

Their O
dumplings B-AS
have O
a O
LOT O
of O
chicken B-AS
in O
them O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
was O
fun O
and O
if O
you O
sit O
by O
the O
window B-AS
, O
there O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
- O
watching O
to O
be O
had O
! O

Our O
server B-AS
spilled O
a O
drink O
on O
the O
table B-AS
cloth O
and O
it O
was O
cleaned O
up O
in O
an O
instant O
, O
no O
mess O
, O
free O
drinks B-AS
to O
compensate O
, O
and O
left O
us O
impressed O
at O
how O
seamlessly O
this O
was O
fixed O
. O

After O
a O
few O
minutes O
, O
seeing O
we O
were O
without O
menus B-AS
, O
a O
slightly O
more O
pleasant O
waitress B-AS
approached O
us O
and O
explained O
that O
the O
manageress O
had O
asthma O
and O
wasn O
' O
t O
in O
a O
good O
mood O
. O

In O
the O
winter O
they O
have O
the O
fireplaces B-AS
working O
which O
immediately O
creates O
a O
cozy O
romantic O
feel B-AS
. O

from O
the O
pad B-AS

, O
Rice B-AS
delivers O
good O
quality B-AS

affordable O
and O
pretty O
darn O
authentic O
Thai B-AS
food I-AS
in O
a O
city O
known O
for O
fusing O
it O
with O
every O
other O
imaginable O
combination O
. O

after O
dinner B-AS
we O
went O
downstairs O
atmosphere B-AS
was O
completely O
different O
, O
nice O
crowd O
, O
we O
stayed O
there O
more O
time O
than O
expected O
. O

Since O
the O
waiter B-AS
NEVER O
checked O
on O
us O
during O
the O
meal B-AS
, O
she O
never O
had O
the O
chance O
to O
ask O

The O
Scene B-AS
There O
' O
s O
nothing O
fancy O
about O
this O
joint O
, O
where O
the O
line O
for O
takeout B-AS
often O
dwarfs O
those O
huddled O
at O
the O
three O
patio O
- O
style O
tables B-AS
. O

Be O
prepared O
to O
wait O
for O
a O
table B-AS
- O
go O
to O
the O
upstairs O
bar B-AS
and O
crack O
open O
a O
bottle O
of O
wine O
, O
or O
a O
nice O
bottle B-AS
of I-AS
Italian I-AS
beer I-AS
, O
and O
get O
to O
know O
everyone O
else O
waiting O
- O
who O
knows O
, O
you O
could O
be O
sitting O
with O
them O
for O
dinner B-AS
! O

The O
service B-AS
was O
punctual O
, O
having O
been O
asked O
for O
our O
drink B-AS
orders O
even O
before O
opening O
our O
menus B-AS
. O

Despite O
the O
servers B-AS
' O
best O
intentions O
, O
it O
' O
s O
easy O
to O
feel O
rushed O
while O
perusing O
the O
menu B-AS
- O
- O
an O
awkwardly O
large O
blackboard B-AS
. O

Our O
waitress B-AS
brought O
him O
a O
regular O
coke O
instead O
of O
a O
diet O
coke O
, O
and O
the O
salsa B-AS
had O
OIL O
floating O
at O
the O
top O
. O

My O
mouth O
almost O
dropped O
, O
and O
for O
good O
reason O
, O
when O
the O
server B-AS
brought O
my O
sandwhich B-AS
and O
side O
of O
macaroni O
. O

The O
service B-AS
is O
excellent O
- O
- O
the O
staff B-AS
is O
attentive O
and O
the O
waitress B-AS
was O
well O
- O
informed O
about O
the O
menu B-AS
. O

The O
Scene B-AS
With O
its O
long O
zinc O
bar B-AS
, O
plush O
couches O
and O
patterned O
suede O
walls O
, O
the O
lounge O
is O
a O
swank O
spot O
for O
midtown O
' O
s O
cocktail O
crowd O
. O

I O
have O
never O
paid O
so O
much O
at O
a O
dinner B-AS
in O
my O
life O
but O
we O
also O
got O
very O
nice O
3 O
bottles O
of O
wine B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
scrumptious O
- O
not O
the O
usual O
wedding B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
not O
gourmet O
fare O
it O
was O
perfectly O
fine O
burgers O
, O
salads B-AS
and O
pasta B-AS
. O

DINERS B-AS
serve O
better O
french B-AS
toast I-AS
than O
Balthazar B-AS
. O

I O
have O
dined O
here O
for O
over O
20 O
years O
and O
I O
know O
the O
management B-AS
will O
NOT O
compromise O
the O
cuisine O
for O
any O
haute O
trendy O
fare B-AS
. O

We O
went O
to O
Steinhof O
about O
a O
week O
ago O
and O
sat O
at O
the O
bar O
since O
the O
place B-AS
was O
packed O
, O
but O
they O
have O
the O
full O
menu B-AS
at O
the O
bar O
. O

After O
2 O
tries O
by O
the O
waiter B-AS
to O
take O
it O
away O
( O
we O
hadn O
' O
t O
even O
looked O
at O
it O
yet O
, O
we O
had O
full O
beers B-AS
yet O
to O
drink O
) O
, O
the O
manager B-AS
approached O
and O
told O
us O
they O
needed O
the O
table O
for O
people O
with O
reservations B-AS
. O

He O
, O
however O
, O
gave O
great O
service O
even O
though O
he O
just O
brought O
our O
food B-AS
since O
they O
didn O
' O
t O
have O
a O
runner B-AS
. O

After O
our O
waitress B-AS
brought O
us O
menus O
took O
our O
drink B-AS
orders O
, O
a O
diff O
hostess B-AS
came O
over O
asked O
us O
to O
give O
up O
our O
table B-AS
. O

it O
was O
really O
good O
, O
but O
i O
also O
mistakenly O
chose O
the O
lobster B-AS
course I-AS
as O
my O
entre O
and O
it O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
the O
same O
dish B-AS
as O
my O
appetizer B-AS
( O
but O
warmed O
) O
. O

After O
I O
have O
my O
dinner B-AS
I O
try O
to O
talk O
to O
the O
manager B-AS
and O
let O
him O
know O
that O
he O
had O
very O
good O
workers B-AS
and O
that O
he O
should O
be O
more O
considerate O
with O
them O
and O
the O
answer O
that O
I O
got O
from O
him O
was O
( O
THey O
can O
leave O
I O
don O
' O
t O
care O
) O
. O

Mango B-AS
ice I-AS
cream I-AS
or O
coffee O
- O
flavored O
gelatin O
finishes O
the O
flavorful O
journey B-AS
. O

Also O
had O
to O
ask O
the O
host B-AS
for O
our O
apps O
becasue O
our O
waiter B-AS
was O
never O
around O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
a O
little O
but O
flawed O
, O
( O
they O
brought O
us O
beers B-AS
without O
the O
glasses B-AS
brought O
the O
main O
course O
out O
before O
cleaning O
off O
the O
appetizers B-AS
) O
but O
nothing O
that O
would O
ruin O
your O
evening O
. O

loved O
everything O
from O
the O
ricotta B-AS
cheese I-AS
they O
put O
on O
the O
table O
to O
the O
osso B-AS
bucco I-AS
with O
risotto B-AS
, O
wish O
i O
understood O
their O
menu B-AS
its O
all O
in O
italian O
, O
not O
good O
for O
a O
sweed O
. O

Food B-AS
was O
ok O
, O
appetizers B-AS
were O
expensive O
compared O
to O
the O
cheap O
main O
dishes B-AS
. O

They O
lost O
our O
reservations B-AS
and O
the O
manager B-AS
quickly O
came O
over O
and O
apologized O
and O
then O
gave O
us O
a O
free O
round O
of O
drinks O
and O
free O
dessert O
. O

Wonderful O
service B-AS
, O
not O
too O
long O
a O
wait B-AS
for O
tables B-AS
, O
price O
is O
right O
- O
in O
a O
word O
, O
go O
! O

After O
our O
disappointing O
meal O
and O
terrible O
service B-AS
we O
asked O
to O
speak O
to O
the O
manager B-AS
( O
who O
was O
sitting O
alone O
having O
a O
glass B-AS
of I-AS
wine I-AS
) O
when O
we O
were O
told O
he O
was O
too O
busy O
to O
speak O
to O
us O
! O

The O
Scene B-AS
There O
are O
exactly O
three O
small O
tables B-AS
at O
this O
tiny O
hole O
in O
the O
wall O
, O
but O
for O
food B-AS
lovers O
on O
a O
budget O
, O
it O
' O
s O
heaven O
. O

There O
are O
some O
unusual O
items O
on O
the O
menu O
like O
the O
salted B-AS
popcorn I-AS
that O
comes O
with O
appetizes O
and O
the O
Yucca O
potatos O
that O
come O
with O
some O
of O
the O
meals O
, O
foo B-AS
foo I-AS
drinks I-AS
, O
but O
overall O
, O
I O
enjoyed O
everything O
about O
this O
place O
. O

You O
dont O
have O
to O
be O
a O
connoisseur O
to O
know O
damn O
well O
that O
cutting O
a O
steak O
up O
just O
permits O
the O
juices B-AS
to O
flow O
out O
that O
much O
quicker O
, O
leading O
to O
dried O
out O
, O
colder O
meat B-AS
. O

i O
' O
ve O
been O
here O
for O
brunch B-AS
twice O
, O
and O
the O
food B-AS
' O
s O
not O
bad O
- O
- O
was O
getting O
sick O
of O
teddy O
' O
s O
and O
relish O
every O
weekend O
. O

To O
be O
fair O
, O
I O
realize O
I O
was O
there O
for O
lunch B-AS
and O
that O
the O
food O
is O
probbably O
better O
at O
dinner O
service O
when O
a O
full O
kitchen B-AS
staff I-AS
has O
arrived O
and O
prepped O
, O
but O
I O
doubt O
I O
' O
d O
return O
to O
find O
out O
with O
so O
many O
other O
options O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
i O
already O
trust O
. O

Our O
server B-AS
was O
a O
delight O
, O
she O
helped O
guide O
us O
through O
the O
menu B-AS
with O
honest O
insight O
. O

Have O
the O
kitchen O
split O
as O
an O
appetizer B-AS
its O
signature B-AS
cheese I-AS
and O
linguini O
pasta B-AS
that O
is O
curled O
in O
a O
large O
round B-AS
cheese I-AS
bowl I-AS
that O
look O
like O
a O
giant O
candle O
right O
at O
your O
table O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
no O
better O
then O
average O
, O
and O
the O
waitress B-AS
rushed O
us O
through O
our O
meal B-AS
in O
less O
then O
an O
hour O
( O
drinks B-AS
, O
appetizer B-AS
, O
entree B-AS
, O
desert B-AS
) O
. O

And O
like O
all O
McNally O
hot O
spots B-AS
, O
it O
crackles O
with O
energy O
, O
particularly O
from O
the O
groups O
who O
gather O
to O
share O
a O
bite O
in O
the O
bar B-AS
. O

Olives B-AS
served I-AS
at O
the O
bar B-AS
are O
wonderful O
. O

The O
Food B-AS
An O
a B-AS
la I-AS
carte I-AS
menu I-AS
offers O
specialties O
like O
Kobe O
beef O
cooked O
on O
a O
hot O
rock O
, O
but O
the O
Kaiseki O
, O
a O
traditional O
multicourse B-AS
tasting O
dinner O
served O
on O
gorgeous O
pottery O
and O
porcelain O
, O
promises O
dining O
adventure O
. O

I O
would O
definately O
recommend O
it O
everyone O
, O
even O
if O
you O
aren O
' O
t O
a O
red B-AS
meat I-AS
fan O
, O
my O
friend O
had O
the O
pasta B-AS
and O
completely O
cleaned O
her O
plate O
. O

My O
advice O
is O
to O
head O
south O
to O
Chinatown O
where O
you O
can O
get O
better O
food B-AS
at O
half O
the O
price B-AS
and O
that O
communal O
dining B-AS
experience O
too O
! O

For O
dinner B-AS
I O
had O
their O
lobster B-AS
risotto I-AS
( O
phenomenal O
) O
. O

26 O
seats B-AS
also O
has O
the O
most O
reasonable O
prices B-AS
in O
NYC O
, O
it O
is O
a O
true O
gem O
. O

The O
wine B-AS
did O
not O
come O
until O
we O
were O
half O
way O
through O
our O
entree B-AS
and O
the O
waitress B-AS
overcharged O
us O
by O
a O
bottle O
of O
wine O
. O

Went O
early O
with O
reservation B-AS
, O
place B-AS
was O
empty O
, O
and O
they O
squeezed O
our O
two O
top O
in O
between O
other O
diners O
at O
a O
banquette O
. O

While O
the O
food B-AS
was O
good O
enough O
( O
if O
old O
- O
fashioned O
- O
my O
meal B-AS
tasted O
like O
it O
was O
out O
of O
a O
fancy O
1950s O
cookbook O
, O
all O
creamy O
and O
rich O
) O
the O
environment B-AS
was O
sort O
of O
bizarre O
- O
rich O
tapestries O
, O
yucky O
corner O
- O
grocer O
roses O
on O
the O
tables B-AS
, O
and O
a O
strange O
' O
80s O
mirrored O
wall O
, O
which O
we O
sat O
against O
at O
the O
back O
of O
the O
restaurant O
. O

Food B-AS
is O
served B-AS
simply O
but O
quickly O
with O
a O
smile O
. O

from O
the O
white B-AS
sheets I-AS
that O
hang O
when O
you O
come O
into O
the O
restaurant O
, O
to O
the O
gorgeous O
marble B-AS
communal I-AS
table I-AS
in O
the O
center O
of O
the O
bottom O
floor O
, O
to O
the O
great O
atmosphere B-AS
upstairs O
at O
the O
bar O
. O

fresh O
fish B-AS
, O
huge O
selection O
of O
hot B-AS
entrees I-AS
for O
those O
that O
dont O
eat O
sushi O
- O
and O
LOTS O
of O
rolls B-AS
and O
appetizers B-AS
for O
sushi B-AS
lovers I-AS
. O

Okay O
, O
so O
the O
bathroom B-AS
is O
a O
little O
scary O
and O
the O
milieu O
brings O
to O
mind O
an O
old O
diner O
or O
cafeteria O
, O
but O
simply O
put O
, O
the O
food B-AS
here O
is O
the O
best O
. O

The O
presentation O
of O
some O
of O
the O
dishes B-AS
and O
desserts B-AS
were O
great O
but O
taste O
and O
quality O
of O
the O
food B-AS
was O
sub O
- O
par O
especially O
for O
the O
prices B-AS
that O
we O
were O
paying O
. O

The O
thin B-AS
organic I-AS
burger I-AS
lacks O
the O
flavor O
of O
a B-AS
prime I-AS
beef I-AS
patty O
, O
requiring O
add O
- O
ons O
like O
cheese O
( O
cheddar B-AS
, O
Swiss O
or O
soy O
- O
based O
) O
, O
bacon B-AS
( O
maple O
- O
cured O
or O
faux O
) O
and O
grilled O
onions O
. O

As O
well O
, O
I O
haven O
' O
t O
eaten O
animal O
products O
in O
over O
6 O
years O
and O
the O
waiter B-AS
was O
not O
sure O
which O
dishes B-AS
had O
honey O
or O
casien O
in O
the O
food O
. O

Also O
some O
other O
appetizers B-AS
, O
like O
the O
snow B-AS
crab I-AS
or O
the O
steak O
, O
lobster B-AS
, O
can O
' O
t O
tell O
which O
one O
was O
better O
! O
But O
would O
recommend O
to O
go O
with O
the O
tasting O
courses B-AS
. O

The O
Food B-AS
Meat I-AS
is O
the O
name O
of O
the O
game O
here O
, O
especially O
if O
you O
are O
a O
fan O
of O
mutton O
: O
the O
legendary O
chop B-AS
is O
rightly O
gamey O
and O
thick O
as O
a O
brick O
. O

I O
have O
never O
been O
to O
an O
establishment O
that O
boasts O
traditional O
French O
service O
that O
basically O
throws O
food B-AS
at O
you O
; O
waiters B-AS
not O
only O
reach O
across O
the O
table O
but O
drip O
wine B-AS
and O
water O
all O
over O
their O
diners O
. O

We O
had O
reservations B-AS
and O
were O
seated B-AS
immediately O
, O
got O
a O
nice O
table O
by O
the O
window O
. O

the O
heroes B-AS
are O
enough O
for O
lunch B-AS
and O
dinner B-AS
. O

Downstairs O
, O
with O
the O
lighter O
menu B-AS
, O
and O
uncomfortable O
seating O
, O
is O
only O
worthwhile O
if O
people O
watching O
and O
the O
energy O
of O
the O
bar B-AS
scene I-AS
is O
more O
important O
to O
you O
than O
the O
food B-AS
. O

The O
other O
steaks O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
were O
$ O
30 O
- O
$ O
40 O
, O
so O
the O
waiter B-AS
really O
should O
have O
told O
them O
the O
price B-AS
of O
the O
special O
. O

The O
bartender B-AS
has O
a O
nasty O
attitude O
, O
and O
it O
took O
a O
party O
of O
two O
1 O
1 O
/ O
2 O
hours O
to O
get O
seated O
while O
party O
after O
party O
of O
the O
hosts O
' O
friends O
' O
were O
given O
seating B-AS
immediately I-AS
. O

Not O
the O
best O
ambiance B-AS
, O
but O
meat B-AS
that O
' O
ll O
make O
you O
drool O
. O

Forget O
Brunch O
- O
there O
are O
usually O
people O
waiting B-AS
outside O
, O
although O
the O
brunches B-AS
are O
delish O
as O
well O
! O

The O
bar B-AS
is O
small O
so O
come O
close O
to O
reservation O
time B-AS
. O

Maybe O
it O
was O
because O
we O
went O
during O
the O
restaurant O
week O
lunch B-AS
special O
, O
but O
the O
service B-AS
was O
not O
impressive O
at O
all O
and O
the O
food O
was O
okay O
, O
but O
not O
great O
. O

The O
seafood B-AS
salad I-AS
was O
yummy O
as O
was O
the O
filet B-AS
of O
sole B-AS
stuffed I-AS
with O
crabmeat B-AS
. O

The O
french O
fries O
are O
soggy O
, O
the O
service B-AS
is O
so O
/ O
so O
and O
while O
it O
looks O
like O
a O
cute O
little O
homestyle O
cafe O
you O
' O
d O
find O
in O
SF O
, O
the O
food B-AS
is O
below O
average O
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
brought O
us O
the O
desert B-AS
menu I-AS
, O
and O
when O
we O
refused O
asked O
if O
we O
were O
really O
sure O
we O
didn O
' O
t O
want O
anything O
. O

Service B-AS
during O
dinner B-AS
was O
alright O
, O
but O
one O
' O
s O
perception O
to O
a O
restaurant O
usually O
starts O
from O
the O
very O
beginning O
: O
the O
entrance O
. O

My O
two O
best O
friends O
took O
me O
to O
Cafe O
Gray O
for O
my O
birthday O
and O
by O
the O
end O
of O
the O
dinner B-AS
, O
they O
were O
apologizing O
for O
the O
poor O
service B-AS
and O
so O
- O
so O
food O
. O

As O
for O
dinner B-AS
, O
my O
favorite O
is O
the O
steak B-AS
frites I-AS
or O
the O
crabcake B-AS
. O

In O
addition O
to O
Pizza B-AS
, O
Dani O
has O
great O
homemade B-AS
Ravioli I-AS
and O
Maniccoti B-AS
. O

complaints O
were O
shrugged O
off O
and O
service B-AS
was O
slow O
, O
causing O
the O
dinner B-AS
to O
go O
on O
for O
over O
2 O
hours O
. O

If O
you O
go O
in O
, O
make O
sure O
to O
listen O
to O
the O
unbelievably O
loud O
microphone O
that O
the O
folks O
at O
the O
counter B-AS
use O
to O
dictate O
orders O
to O
the O
cooks B-AS
who O
stand O
about O
two O
feet O
behind O
them O
. O

Although O
the O
decor B-AS
is O
lovely O
as O
usual O
, O
service B-AS
has O
detiorated O
. O

It O
is O
a O
thick O
drink B-AS
which O
almost O
taste O
like O
a O
cream B-AS
of I-AS
rice I-AS
. O

My O
partner O
had O
ordered O
an O
appetizer O
that O
was O
no O
longer O
available O
; O
the O
waitress B-AS
did O
not O
inform O
us O
when O
reviewing O
the O
specials B-AS
. O

The O
other O
food B-AS
they O
serve B-AS
is O
also O
very O
good O
, O
but O
the O
pizza B-AS
keeps O
calling O
me O
back O
! O

The O
brunch B-AS
is O
$ O
12 O
and O
includes O
unlimited O
pound B-AS
cake I-AS
( O
homemeade O
) O
and O
mimosas O
, O
and O
complimentary O
OJ B-AS
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
brought O
the O
wrong O
food O
and O
charged O
us O
for O
food O
and O
drinks B-AS
we O
didn O
' O
t O
order O
. O

While O
the O
food B-AS
was O
good O
and O
reasonably O
priced O
, O
the O
service B-AS
was O
horrible O
. O

I O
left O
feeling O
unsatisfied O
, O
except O
for O
having O
a O
nice O
chance O
to O
people O
watch O
in O
the O
cozy O
atmosphere B-AS
with O
my O
over O
- O
priced O
pasta B-AS
bolognese I-AS
. O

Pizza O
- O
the O
only O
pizza O
in O
NYC O
that O
should O
not O
have O
additional O
toppings B-AS
- O
the O
crust B-AS
tastes O
like O
the O
best O
, O
freshly O
baked O
bread B-AS
! O

After O
a O
21 O
/ O
2 O
hour O
lunch B-AS
in O
which O
our O
displeasure O
was O
apparent O
, O
we O
didn O
' O
t O
receive O
an O
apology O
or O
an O
explanation O
from O
the O
waiter B-AS
or O
manager B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
wasn O
' O
t O
overwhelming O
, O
but O
was O
very O
tasty O
, O
and O
the O
space B-AS
wasn O
' O
t O
overcrowded O
or O
obnoxious O
- O
the O
waiters O
and O
waitresses B-AS
were O
attentive O
and O
helpful O
, O
but O
not O
obtrusive O
. O

For O
entrees B-AS
, O
we O
all O
had O
the O
steak B-AS
frites I-AS
and O
it O
was O
to O
die O
for O
. O

We O
showed O
up O
and O
waited O
30 O
minutes O
in O
line O
30 O
minutes O
to O
get O
our O
drinks B-AS
- O
after O
we O
asked O
twice O
, O
the O
service B-AS
was O
the O
worst O
I O
' O
ve O
had O
in O
nyc O
. O

Dining B-AS
experience O
begins O
with O
cracked O
, O
filthy O
vinyl O
tile B-AS
flooring I-AS
tables I-AS
so O
small O
close O
together O
that O
you O
couldn O
' O
t O
move O
. O

It O
' O
s O
always O
exciting O
to O
see O
celebrities O
hiding O
in O
the O
corner O
banquettes O
or O
behind O
sunglasses O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
, O
but O
the O
real O
draw O
is O
the O
chef B-AS
' O
s O
short O
ribs B-AS
and O
the O
volumous B-AS
wine I-AS
list I-AS
. O

The O
decor B-AS
reminds O
me O
of O
Miami O
nightclubs O
, O
and O
we O
sat O
in O
a O
cool O
communal O
strip O
, O
where O
you O
share O
your O
table B-AS
with O
people O
. O

Food B-AS
was O
cold O
when O
it O
arrived O
, O
waitress B-AS
would O
vanish O
for O
30 O
minute O
periods O
before O
reappearing O
, O
wrong O
side O
dishes B-AS
were O
served O
, O
meals O
improperly O
cooked O
, O
and O
the O
manager B-AS
failed O
to O
apologize O
when O
confronted O
. O

Last O
night O
the O
wife O
and O
I O
went O
for O
the O
daily O
5pm O
- O
7pm O
$ O
18 O
prix O
- O
fixe O
, O
which O
included O
choices O
of O
appetizer B-AS
( O
my O
stuffed B-AS
mushrooms I-AS
were O
delicious O
) O
, O
entree O
( O
rigatoni O
for O
me O
, O
chicken B-AS
for O
her O
) O
, O
and O
dessert B-AS
( O
tiramisu B-AS
and O
zeppoles O
) O
. O

I O
like O
how O
the O
ambiance B-AS
changes O
from O
the O
cafeteria O
style B-AS
of O
lunch B-AS
to O
a O
sit O
down O
dinner B-AS
in O
romantic O
lighting O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
delicious O
; O
the O
service O
was O
a O
little O
slow O
, O
but O
it O
didn O
' O
t O
seem O
TOO O
bad O
( O
maybe O
becuase O
of O
the O
martinis B-AS
I O
consumed O
while O
waiting O
for O
my O
table O
) O
. O

The O
bagels B-AS
here O
are O
so O
good O
that O
to O
put O
cream B-AS
cheese I-AS
on O
them O
would O
be O
an O
injustice O
. O

some O
old O
drunk O
guy O
who O
claims O
he O
is O
an O
American O
born O
in O
France O
seems O
to O
be O
a O
regular O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
, O
he O
sat O
down O
next O
to O
us O
, O
listened O
to O
our O
whole O
conversation O
then O
started O
aggressing O
us O
verbally O
, O
and O
the O
waiter B-AS
took O
the O
longest O
time O
to O
intervene O
. O

When O
our O
first O
order O
came O
, O
they O
forgot O
the O
torro B-AS
( O
which O
we O
later O
learned O
it O
was O
finished O
for O
the O
night B-AS
. O

When O
the O
pizza B-AS
arrived O
it O
was O
definitely O
hot O
, O
however O
the O
topping B-AS
was O
rather O
soggy O
from O
the O
moisture O
from O
the O
fresh O
tomatoes B-AS
. O

For O
dinner O
I O
order O
linguine O
w B-AS
/ I-AS
red I-AS
clam B-AS
sauce I-AS
, O
the O
pasta B-AS
was O
perfect O
and O
the O
sauce O
was O
flavorful O
but O
the O
clams O
tasted O
funny O
so O
I O
ate O
around O
them O
. O

There O
is O
no O
bar B-AS
so O
therefore O
no O
place O
to O
wait O
except O
the O
lounge B-AS
that O
was O
packed O
so O
after O
wondering O
where O
to O
stand O
the O
hostess B-AS
grabbed O
us O
. O

After O
ordering O
our O
food B-AS
was O
brought O
to O
our O
table O
very O
quickly O
despite O
the O
huge O
crowd B-AS
. O

Great O
inexpensive O
meal B-AS
for O
lunch B-AS
or O
for O
dinner B-AS
. O

The O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
was O
small O
but O
had O
a O
nice O
variety B-AS
. O

The O
waitress B-AS
came O
to O
our O
table B-AS
once O
for O
our O
order O
, O
but O
then O
we O
were O
tended O
to O
by O
who O
I O
thought O
was O
the O
hostess B-AS
. O

They O
do O
have O
a O
large O
menu B-AS
of O
things O
along O
the O
diner B-AS
lines I-AS
, O
and O
they O
go O
a O
little O
gourmet B-AS
on O
the O
brunch O
omelette O
fixins B-AS
/ I-AS
combos I-AS
. O

Don O
' O
t O
go O
here O
for O
sushi B-AS
, O
but O
for O
one O
of O
the O
other O
lovely O
seafood B-AS
dishes I-AS
, O
i O
. O

As O
for O
the O
main O
attraction O
, O
the O
pies O
are O
known O
for O
their O
crisp O
outer O
edge O
and O
gooey O
middle B-AS
, O
and O
feature O
the O
unorthodox O
layering B-AS
of O
sauce B-AS
over I-AS
mozzarella I-AS
. O

The O
waiters B-AS
are O
nice O
, O
but O
weren O
' O
t O
particularly O
good O
- O
waited O
forever O
to O
order O
and O
resented O
not O
being O
told O
that O
my O
dinner B-AS
companion O
and O
I O
had O
ordered O
enough O
for O
a O
table O
of O
10 O
( O
given O
the O
size B-AS
of O
the O
sushi O
) O
. O

Try O
the O
fresh O
ricotta B-AS
cheesecake I-AS
with O
a O
beautifully O
buttery O
crust B-AS
and O
fresh O
raspberry O
topping O
, O
or O
the O
chocolate B-AS
and I-AS
Kahlua I-AS
mousse I-AS
, O
with O
a O
gelato O
- O
like O
consistency O
that O
pairs O
wonderfully O
with O
vanilla O
ice B-AS
cream I-AS
. O

The O
crab O
croquettes O
were O
fried O
and O
completely O
lacking O
in O
crabmeat B-AS
, O
our O
meat B-AS
appetizer I-AS
was O
dripping O
with O
grease O
and O
mostly O
fatty O
, O
and O
our O
main B-AS
course I-AS
was O
mushy O
rice B-AS
drowned O
in O
some O
sauce B-AS
with O
the O
consistency O
of O
baby O
food O
. O

first O
of O
all O
, O
the O
hostess B-AS
was O
not O
pleasant O
and O
had O
a O
bit O
of O
an O
attitude O
when O
seating B-AS
us O
. O

Yes O
, O
the O
prices B-AS
SEEM O
afordable O
, O
but O
the O
portions B-AS
are O
so O
small O
that O
you O
end O
up O
spending O
$ O
100 O
+ O
just O
to O
fill O
2 O
people O
and O
get O
a O
couple O
drinks B-AS
. O

Portion B-AS
was O
just O
a O
bit O
small O
compare O
with O
other O
restaurant O
but O
the O
price B-AS
was O
lower O
than O
usualy O
as O
well O
( O
7 O
. O

Take O
out O
and O
delivery B-AS
is O
next O
door O
and O
usually O
will O
be O
better O
if O
you O
are O
looking O
to O
get O
your O
food B-AS
faster O
. O

The O
place B-AS
was O
nice O
and O
the O
bartenders O
were O
friendly O
, O
but O
the O
cocktail B-AS
girl I-AS
was O
rude O
, O
obnoxious O
, O
and O
over O
charging O
all O
of O
us O
. O

Service O
was O
a O
treat O
from O
my O
French O
( O
Canandian O
) O
waiter O
who O
knows O
more O
about O
wine B-AS
than O
anyone O
waiting O
on O
me O
in O
NYC O
in O
a O
long O
time B-AS
. O

We O
then O
split O
some O
appetizers B-AS
as O
the O
portions B-AS
are O
large O
- O
the O
calamari B-AS
salad I-AS
was O
fantastic O
. O

I O
haven O
' O
t O
had O
the O
pasta B-AS
, O
but O
the O
appetizers B-AS
, O
salads O
, O
and O
entrees O
( O
especially O
the O
steak B-AS
and O
lamb B-AS
) O
are O
extraordinary O
. O

We O
could O
not O
believe O
that O
the O
owner B-AS
only O
laughed O
and O
continued O
serving B-AS
him O
drinks B-AS
. O

Get O
the O
Steak O
, O
get O
the O
Ham B-AS
Fried I-AS
Rice I-AS
, O
Get O
the O
Braised B-AS
Fish I-AS
, O
Get O
anything O
Pork B-AS
and O
Ham O
, O
Appetizers B-AS
are O
good O
too O
. O

A O
+ O
was O
planning O
a O
party O
for O
my O
staff B-AS
, O
and O
was O
treated O
rudely O
by O
another O
restaurant O
when O
trying O
to O
add O
more O
people O
to O
reservation B-AS
( O
a O
simple O
no O
would O
have O
worked O
) O
. O

We O
waited O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
for O
only O
10 O
minutes O
( O
we O
had O
a O
reservation O
) O
- O
can O
' O
t O
complain O
about O
that O
, O
the O
restaurant O
was O
full O
and O
I O
enjoyed O
the O
lively O
atmosphere B-AS
and O
music B-AS
. O

The O
specials B-AS
of O
the O
day B-AS
are O
the O
way O
to O
go O
. O

The O
bright O
point B-AS
of O
dinner B-AS
was O
dessrt O
. O

The O
manager B-AS
also O
managed O
to O
insult O
one O
of O
my O
dining B-AS
partners O
, O
even O
using O
an O
expletive O
to O
mock O
his O
last O
name O
when O
returning O
his O
credit O
card O
. O

Service B-AS
at O
the O
bar B-AS
was O
fine O
, O
just O
as O
you O
would O
expect O
. O

the O
staff B-AS
prefers O
to O
watch O
TV O
in O
the O
main B-AS
dining I-AS
room I-AS
infront O
of O
their O
waiting O
customers O
then O
serve O
their O
customers O
. O

The O
service B-AS
isn O
' O
t O
spectacular O
and O
neither O
is O
the O
ambience B-AS
, O
but O
on O
a O
lunch B-AS
hour O
, O
all O
you O
' O
re O
looking O
for O
is O
a O
satisfied O
stomach O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
terrible O
, O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
everything O
and O
ask O
several O
of O
different O
people O
for O
the O
same O
thing O
before O
we O
were O
allowed O
to O
be O
served B-AS
. O

The O
menu B-AS
goes O
on O
to O
include O
some O
of O
traditional B-AS
greek I-AS
favorites O
but O
each O
has O
a O
twist O
that O
will O
suprise O
and O
delight O
you O
. O

If O
you O
' O
re O
tired O
of O
the O
long O
waits O
for O
table O
at O
nearby O
place O
, O
then O
head O
to O
Moutarde O
for O
a O
delicious O
meal B-AS
that O
won O
' O
t O
keep O
you O
waiting B-AS
. O

I O
even O
overheard O
the O
one O
waiter B-AS
argue O
to O
the O
host B-AS
about O
that O
and O
then O
they O
conveniently O
switched O
to O
speaking O
Spanish O
. O

I O
don O
' O
t O
claim O
to O
know O
enough O
about O
authentic O
Italian B-AS
cuisine I-AS
but O
the O
food B-AS
is O
good O
, O
provided O
they O
have O
the O
menu B-AS
item O
you O
order O
. O

The O
Romano B-AS
family I-AS
is O
very O
hands O
on O
with O
the O
father O
supervising O
the O
kitchen B-AS
and O
Santo O
, O
the O
son O
, O
running O
the O
room O
with O
a O
high O
degree O
of O
personal O
attention O
. O

This O
seems O
to O
be O
a O
big O
hit O
and O
draws O
a O
large O
crowd B-AS
, O
so O
be O
prepared O
for O
a O
wait B-AS
. O

Finally O
got O
our O
food B-AS
after O
waiting O
a O
long O
time B-AS
for O
oysters O
, O
doesn O
' O
t O
take O
that O
long O
to O
shuck O
' O
em O
, O
the O
place O
isn O
' O
t O
that O
big O
, O
and O
it O
was O
OK O
. O

Gobo O
' O
s O
scallion B-AS
pancakes I-AS
are O
a O
bit O
dry O
, O
and O
the O
beet B-AS
salad I-AS
is O
low O
on O
beets O
, O
but O
the O
majority B-AS
of O
dishes B-AS
, O
especially O
those O
showcasing B-AS
vegetables I-AS
, O
are O
delicious O
in O
their O
simplicity O
. O

The O
menu B-AS
is O
varied O
but O
I O
think O
it O
is O
the O
chicken B-AS
which O
they O
do O
best O
as O
. O

We O
wouldn O
' O
t O
have O
had O
a O
problem O
with O
this O
if O
the O
burger B-AS
had O
actually O
been O
tasty O
but O
even O
with O
the O
foie O
- O
gras O
, O
cheddar B-AS
cheese I-AS
, O
apple B-AS
smoked I-AS
bacon I-AS
, O
leaks O
, O
etc O
. O

Since O
it O
' O
s O
a O
small O
place O
, O
it O
' O
s O
best O
to O
get O
there O
early O
for O
dinner O
as O
the O
wait B-AS
can O
be O
quite O
long O
if O
you O
don O
' O
t O
make O
a O
reservation B-AS
. O

The O
prices B-AS
are O
decent O
for O
this O
type O
of O
food B-AS
and O
dining O
experience B-AS
. O

The O
manager B-AS
finally O
came O
by O
to O
apologize O
and O
offered O
to O
give O
us O
a O
greek B-AS
salad I-AS
on O
the O
house O
. O

The O
was O
very O
little O
if O
any O
seasoning B-AS
on O
the O
meat B-AS
, O
and O
the O
outsiside O
has O
nice O
sear B-AS
marks I-AS
and O
a O
rich O
taste B-AS
. O

There O
are O
times O
when O
there O
is O
a O
long O
wait B-AS
at O
lunch B-AS
so O
be O
safe O
and O
make O
a O
reservation B-AS
. O

She O
asked O
for O
only O
a O
glass B-AS
of I-AS
water I-AS
, O
and O
the O
waitress B-AS
refused O
, O
to O
her O
face O
, O
twice O
. O

the O
waitress B-AS
was O
not O
attentive O
at O
all O
and O
we O
had O
to O
keep O
getting O
the O
attention O
of O
the O
water O
servers B-AS
to O
get O
more O
drinks B-AS
. O

Stay O
away O
from O
the O
two O
specialty O
rolls O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
though O
- O
too O
much O
avocado O
and O
rice B-AS
will O
fill O
you O
up O
right O
quick O
. O

Although O
the O
food B-AS
was O
good O
, O
the O
way O
our O
waiter B-AS
treated O
us O
was O
so O
rude O
and O
bad O
- O
mannered O
that O
it O
almost O
ruined O
our O
night O
and O
he O
even O
asked O
us O
to O
give O
him O
a O
better O
tip B-AS
! O
! O
! O

Its O
great O
for O
people O
who O
want O
to O
try O
Korean B-AS
food I-AS
, O
but O
can O
' O
t O
understand O
the O
servers B-AS
or O
the O
menu B-AS
on O
32nd O
St O
. O

Went O
to O
dinner B-AS
on O
a O
Friday O
night O
and O
the O
place B-AS
was O
packed O
and O
hot O
. O

Philippe O
should O
re O
- O
train O
their O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
to O
communicate O
with O
one O
another O
and O
better O
orchestrate O
the O
timing O
of O
food B-AS
service I-AS
. O

This O
is O
a O
busy O
spot O
from O
1130 O
AM O
to O
130 O
PM O
M O
- O
F O
but O
you O
never O
have O
to O
wait O
more O
than O
5 O
minutes O
for O
a O
table O
, O
unless O
you O
have O
a O
large O
party O
, O
thanks O
to O
fast O
and O
friendly O
service B-AS
provided O
by O
the O
waitstaff B-AS
and O
kitchen B-AS
. O

I O
ordered O
the O
plane B-AS
no O
fuss O
SALMON O
and O
it O
was O
honestly O
the O
best O
salmon B-AS
EVER I-AS
. O

I O
noticed O
many O
of O
the O
other O
comments O
had O
negative O
things O
to O
say O
about O
the O
service O
and O
food B-AS
- O
my O
thoughts O
and O
suggestions O
are O
: O
eat O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
to O
avoid O
a O
rude O
waiter B-AS
or O
bad O
service O
here O
and O
Artisanal O
' O
s O
reputation O
is O
based O
on O
the O
cheese O
, O
get O
the O
CHEESE O
and O
not O
the O
steak O
or O
whatever O
. O

it O
is O
a O
small O
take B-AS
- I-AS
out I-AS
style O
restuarant O
but O
they O
have O
a O
few O
tables B-AS
. O

The O
Food B-AS
The O
meal B-AS
begins O
slowly O
, O
with O
a O
plate O
of O
excellent O
garlic B-AS
knots I-AS
. O

I O
have O
been O
there O
for O
dinner B-AS
and O
the O
food B-AS
is O
even O
more O
spectacular O
. O

Aside O
from O
the O
service B-AS
being O
slow O
, O
the O
place B-AS
was O
packed O
w O
/ O
a O
good O
crowd B-AS
and O
music B-AS
was O
amazing O
. O

And O
the O
paella B-AS
for O
two O
is O
actually O
too O
much O
food B-AS
for O
two O
! O

I O
have O
been O
going O
to O
this O
restaurant O
for O
years O
, O
in O
the O
past O
the O
service B-AS
was O
average O
and O
the O
food B-AS
inconsistant O
. O

Overall O
, O
I O
would O
rather O
go O
to O
a O
chain O
coffee O
house O
up O
the O
street O
for O
the O
same O
priced B-AS
coffee I-AS
, O
but O
a O
much O
more O
relaxing O
atmosphere B-AS
, O
and O
no O
one O
forgetting O
my O
order O
. O

The O
Food B-AS
The O
French B-AS
- I-AS
Belgian I-AS
menu I-AS
is O
small O
, O
but O
everything O
on O
it O
is O
satisfyingly O
savory O
, O
from O
a O
simple O
pot B-AS
of O
mussels B-AS
in O
a O
choice O
of O
sauces O
( O
beer O
and O
bacon O
, O
creamy O
mushroom O
, O
or O
white O

and O
garlic O

) O
, O
to O
beef B-AS
stewed I-AS
with I-AS
beer I-AS
and O
prunes O

from O
a O

the O

, O
it O
was O
all O
an O
exquisite O
dining B-AS
experience I-AS
. O

However O
, O
you O
' O
re O
bothered O
by O
things O
like O
sub O
- O
par O
food O
( O
don O
' O
t O
get O
the O
cajun B-AS
fries I-AS
) O
, O
waiters B-AS
who O
hate O
you O
and O
anything O
that O
looks O
like O
you O
, O
close O
proxmitity O
with O
strangers O
, O
and O
cheap O
talking O
and O

skelletons O
, O
do O
NOT O
go O
. O

Asked O
for O
recommendations O
, O
waitress B-AS
said O
read O
everything O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
which O
already O
wasn O
' O
t O
to O
unique O
. O

We O
had O
the O
tasting O
menu B-AS
- O
- O
which O
was O
not O
a O
meal B-AS
! O
! O
! O

The O
un O
- O
customer O
- O
friendly O
manager B-AS
comped O
us O
NOTHING O
for O
waiting B-AS
for O
room B-AS
temperature I-AS
food I-AS
, O
so O
we O
stopped O
ordering O
drinks B-AS
. O

We O
told O
the O
waitress B-AS
we O
' O
d O
like O
the O
fries B-AS
hot O
with O
our O
main B-AS
courses I-AS
but O
she O
only O
ordered O
more O
once O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
food B-AS
had O
arrived O
so O
we O
didn O
' O
t O
get O
them O
until O
we O
were O
half O
way O
through O
. O

hard O
to O
work O
a O
buzz O
with O
the O
server B-AS
taking O
so O
long O
between O
every O
round O
, O
but O
worth O
trying O
the O
signature O
african O
rum O
cocktail O
and O
happily O
surprised O
they O
had O
our O
favorite O
white O
- O
sancerre O
by O
the O
glass B-AS
at O
this O
japanese O
restaurant O
. O

I O
have O
been O
a O
vegetarian O
for O
over O
10 O
years O
, O
I O
do O
eat O
cheese B-AS
but O
when O
a O
person O
is O
on O
a O
diet O
it O
is O
so O
hard O
to O
enjoy O
PIZZA B-AS
. O

Our O
waiter B-AS
brought O
the O
wrong O
dinner B-AS
for O
me O
( O
shrimp O
provencal O
instead O
of O
the O
salmon B-AS
) O
but O
then O
comped O
my O
meal B-AS
with O
no O
question O
. O

Def O
, O
Def O
try O
the O
green B-AS
papaya I-AS
salad I-AS
for O
an O
appetizer B-AS
. O

Service B-AS
was O
slow O
and O
our O
drink B-AS
order O
took O
forever O
( O
and O
the O
place B-AS
wasn O
' O
t O
crowded O
) O
. O

One O
friend O
' O
s O
pizza O
arrived O
about O
15 O
minutes O
before O
the O
rest O
of O
our O
meals B-AS
( O
the O
remainder O
of O
our O
entrees O
did O
not O
even O
arrive O
at O
the O
same O
time O
) O
, O
and O
our O
waiter B-AS
half O
- O
heartedly O
apologized O
for O
the O
delay O
while O
rolling O
his O
eyes O
. O

Minutes O
turned O
into O
an O
hour O
- O
long O
wait B-AS
with O
non B-AS
- I-AS
existent I-AS
standing O
room B-AS
. O

Desserts B-AS
were O
pleasent O
enough O
, O
if O
not O
trying O
way O
to O
hard O
on O
presentation O
, O
lacking O
portions B-AS
and O
interest B-AS
. O

When O
my O
friend O
' O
s O
chicken B-AS
salad I-AS
sandwich I-AS
arrived O
, O
she O
noticed O
a O
nice O
crust B-AS
, O
and O
it O
wasn O
' O
t O
part O
of O
the O
bread B-AS
. O

) O
other O
food O
is O
served O
in O
too O
- O
small O
portions B-AS
, O
but O
at O
least O
it O
leaves O
room O
for O
dessert B-AS
. O

When O
I O
asked O
the O
waitress B-AS
she O
told O
me O
it O
was O
because O
I O
ordered O
pancakes B-AS
. O

After O
reading O
other O
reviews O
I O
was O
expecting O
poor O
service B-AS
and O
ambience O
but O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised O
by O
our O
more O
than O
helpful O
waiter B-AS
. O

The O
menu B-AS
was O
filled O
with O
of O
course O
the O
standard O
sushi O
fair O
, O
but O
the O
real O
gem O
was O
the O
unuusal O
and O
creative O
combinations O
of O
sushis B-AS
and O
sauces B-AS
and O
other O
ingredients O
they O
had O
as O
well O
. O

When O
we O
went O
, O
the O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
did O
not O
talk O
to O
us O
about O
any O
of O
the O
specials B-AS
/ I-AS
the I-AS
menu I-AS
etc O
and O
handed O
us O
our O
bill O
while O
we O
were O
still O
eating O
. O

The O
raspberry B-AS
/ I-AS
marscapone I-AS
- I-AS
stuffed I-AS
pancakes I-AS
are O
so O
divine O
it O
' O
s O
actually O
worth O
putting O
up O
with O
the O
rude O
and O
incompetent O
service B-AS
. O

There O
are O
deli O
items B-AS
and O
cookies O
as O
well O
, O
but O
I O
just O
can O
' O
t O
tear O
myself O
away O
from O
the O
bagels B-AS
! O

Those O
waiting B-AS
inside O
to O
get O
a O
free O
table B-AS
and O
waitresses O
carlessly O
walking O
by O
only O
served O
to O
make O
matters O
worse O
. O

Downstairs B-AS
is O
an O
entirely O
different O
scene O
: O
There O
' O
s O
a O
fireplace O
with O
sofas O
and O
comfy O
chairs B-AS
set O
around O
it O
, O
and O
a O
bar B-AS
off O
to O
the O
side O
. O

I O
understand O
its O
a O
very O
busy O
night O
of O
the O
week O
but O
it O
is O
unacceptable O
that O
I O
was O
hung O
up O
on O
by O
the O
hostess B-AS
twice O
( O
I O
also O
called O
back O
and O
she O
refused O
to O
answer O
the O
phone O
for O
15 O
minutes O
) O
and O
was O
told O
that O
I O
should O
have O
picked O
up O
my O
food B-AS
instead O
of O
having O
it O
delivered O
. O

The O
attention O
to O
detail O
whether O
it O
' O
s O
decor B-AS
or O
service B-AS
or O
menu B-AS
made O
us O
feel O
fortunate O
to O
be O
part O
of O
the O
Camino O
Sur O
dining B-AS
experience O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
ok O
, O
took O
a O
while O
to O
order O
even O
drinks B-AS
. O

If O
I O
had O
a O
car O
, O
I O
' O
d O
go O
there O
more O
often O
, O
but O
I O
live O
35 O
blocks O
away O
and O
don O
' O
t O
trust O
carrying O
pastries B-AS
home O
on O
the O
bumpy O
crowded O
B41 O
busline B-AS
. O

The O
menu B-AS
is O
Prix O
Fixe O
, O
so O
be O
prepared O
to O
spend O
at O
least O
$ O
60 O
per O
person O
, O
but O
it O
is O
Well O
worth O
itsuperb O
food B-AS
. O

The O
deli O
- O
diner O
- O
soul O
- O
food O
menu B-AS
, O
featuring O
everything O
from O
matzo O
balls O
to O
barbecued B-AS
chicken I-AS
and O
ribs O
to O
10 O
- O
ounce O
burgers O
, O
is O
available O
until O
late O
. O

Nice O
ambience B-AS
and O
bar B-AS
while O
waiting O
for O
a O
table B-AS
. O

Go O
for O
brunch B-AS
- O
it O
' O
s O
sure O
to O
please O
for O
those O
who O
like O
their O
eggs B-AS
spicy O
! O

I O
have O
had O
occasion O
to O
go O
to O
this O
establishment O
several O
times O
- O
a O
few O
times O
for O
dinner B-AS
, O
and O
once O
for O
Saturday O
dimsum B-AS
, O
and O
I O
must O
say O
that O
while O
I O
felt O
slightly O
intimidated O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
I O
was O
one O
of O
the O
few O
non O
chinese O
speakers O
there O
, O
the O
food B-AS
was O
rather O
good O
. O

Particularly O
good O
is O
the O
chicken B-AS
verde I-AS
burrito I-AS
with O
a O
refreshingly O
spicy O
salsa O
that O
avoids O
the O
heat O
overkill B-AS
. O

The O
Scene O
There O
are O
two O
distinct O
personalities O
to O
the O
place O
: O
The O
loud O
, O
seemingly O
always O
- O
crowded O
bar B-AS
with O
hanging O
paper O
decorations O
and O
dim O
lighting O
, O
and O
the O
two B-AS
main I-AS
dining I-AS
areas O
, O
where O
the O
noise B-AS
level I-AS
and O
decor O
is O
notably O
more O
subdued O
. O

Try O
a O
traditional O
latin B-AS
favorite O
like O
Arroz O
con O
pollo O
( O
yellow B-AS
rice I-AS
w I-AS
/ I-AS
chicken I-AS
red I-AS
bell I-AS
pepper I-AS
) O
but O
meat B-AS
lovers O
should O
definitely O
not O
miss O
out O
on O
the O
churrasco B-AS
! O

The O
service O
was O
okay O
, O
fast O
seating B-AS
( O
for O
two O
) O
, O
looked O
like O
a O
group O
nearby O
had O
been O
there O
a O
long O
time B-AS
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
warm O
, O
but O
it O
took O
forever O
to O
get O
the O
check B-AS
. O

We O
had O
to O
ask O
for O
water B-AS
even O
after O
we O
were O
asked O
what O
type O
we O
preferred O
, O
and O
then O
the O
busboy B-AS
spilled O
it O
while O
he O
was O
pouring O
it O
out O
. O

This O
newly O
opened O
restaurant O
is O
another O
one O
of O
those O
Indian O
places O
that O
has O
a O
hugely O
promising O
menu B-AS
and O
a O
greatly O
disappointing O
food B-AS
. O

If O
you O
go O
for O
lunch B-AS
as O
we O
did O
, O
get O
there O
when O
they O
open O
as O
seating B-AS
is O
fairly O
limited O
. O

too O
bad O
that O
the O
2 O
sushi O
chefs O
have O
become O
a O
bit O
too O
busy O
to O
chat O
away O
with O
the O
guests O
at O
the O
counter B-AS
, O
but O
they O
try O
and O
hey O
, O
we O
are O
here O
for O
the O
food B-AS
! O
! O
! O

as O
an O
appetizer B-AS
we O
had O
some O
amazing O
citrus B-AS
shrimp I-AS
and O
for O
our O
main O
courses O
we O
each O
got O
a O
pasta B-AS
dish I-AS
. O

Their O
food B-AS
is O
delicious O
and O
they O
send O
you O
cut O
up O
oranges O
to O
cleanse O
your O
palate O
after O
dinner B-AS
which O
is O
a O
very O
nice O
touch O
. O

Each O
table O
has O
a O
pot B-AS
of I-AS
boiling I-AS
water I-AS
sunken O
into O
its O
surface O
, O
and O
you O
get O
platters B-AS
of O
thin O
sliced O
meats B-AS
, O
various O
vegetables B-AS
, O
and O
rice B-AS
and O
glass B-AS
noodles I-AS
. O

Not O
the O
best O
ambience B-AS
and O
the O
service B-AS
is O
sometimes O
just O
mediocre O
, O
but O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
food B-AS
is O
incredible O
. O

The O
hostess B-AS
was O
inefficiently O
seating B-AS
people O
and O
disappeared O
for O
minutes O
at O
a O
time O
, O
letting O
the O
line O
grow O
to O
15 O
+ O
people O
waiting B-AS
to O
put O
their O
names O
on O
the O
list O
. O

The O
Scene B-AS
Vintage O
suitcases O
and O
black O
- O
and O
- O
white O
photos O
of O
old O
ocean O
liners O
evoke O
the O
Golden O
Age O
of O
travel O
in O
the O
front O
bar B-AS
, O
where O
a O
worldly O
clientele B-AS
sips O
cocktails B-AS
around O
a O
flickering O
faux O
fireplace O
. O

Bar B-AS
has O
, O
french B-AS
fries I-AS
, O
bunch O
of O
different O
vegs B-AS
and O
fruits O
, O
sushi O
, O
ribs B-AS
( O
not O
great O
, O
wait O
for O
the O
waiters B-AS
that O
come O
around O
with O
the O
meat B-AS
) O
. O

After O
ordering O
my O
dinner B-AS
and O
having O
it O
come O
to O
the O
table O
totally O
wrong O
, O
the O
manager B-AS
argued O
with O
me O
over O
whether O
my O
meal O
was O
correct O
or O
not O
, O
and O
further O
argued O
that O
the O
mushrooms B-AS
in O
my O
dish B-AS
were O
really O
the O
eggplant B-AS
that O
I O
ordered O
. O

The O
decor B-AS
is O
sparse O
and O
elegant O
, O
the O
service B-AS
warm O
( O
though O
my O
waitress B-AS
was O
occasionally O
difficult O
to O
find O
) O
, O
and O
the O
sushi O
fresh O
. O

I O
had O
the O
pasta B-AS
special I-AS
, O
which O
had O
tremendous O
amount O
of O
seafood B-AS
. O

The O
menu B-AS
does O
not O
have O
much O
and O
what O
we O
did O
have O
- O
original O
pizza O
with O
pepperoni B-AS
and O
sausage O
was O
not O
so O
great O
. O

( O
The O
band B-AS
is O
positioned O
in O
front O
of O
the O
windows O
, O
in O
a O
space B-AS
roughly O
the O
size O
of O
a O
living O
room O

their O
whole B-AS
fish I-AS
with I-AS
red I-AS
chiles I-AS
and O
basil B-AS
. O

i O
' O
ve O
had O
better O
mashed B-AS
potatoes I-AS
from O
a O
box B-AS
, O
and O
the O
vegetables B-AS
were O
soaked O
in O
oil O
. O

Their O
Brunch B-AS
must O
be O
good O
too O
if O
it O
' O
s O
Sangria B-AS
included O
. O

) O
Service B-AS
was O
good O
not O
great O
, O
waiters B-AS
stood O
around O
, O
didn O
' O
t O
ask O
how O
everything O
was O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
eaten O
dinner B-AS
here O
quite O
a O
few O
times O
and O
the O
sushi B-AS
/ I-AS
sashimi I-AS
has O
been O
very O
fresh O
on O
every O
occasion O
. O

Compared O
to O
New O
York O
prices B-AS
, O
the O
menu O
seems O
reasonably O
priced O
( O
it O
is O
not O
cheap O
like O
Fridays O
, O
but O
is O
reasonable O
compared O
to O
top O
quality O
food B-AS
experiences O
in O
this O
city O
) O
. O

Adding O
insult O
to O
injury O
, O
the O
waiter B-AS
had O
to O
ask O
for O
the O
wine B-AS
bottle I-AS
by O
number O
( O
where O
are O
we O
? O

The O
Food B-AS
Nothing O
makes O
for O
better O
bar B-AS
snacks O
than O
this O
down O
- O
home O
Southern O
menu O
. O

With O
only O
2 O
tables B-AS
occupied O
in O
the O
whole O
place O
, O
the O
waitress B-AS
spent O
her O
time O
behind O
the O
bar B-AS
and O
only O
came O
to O
help O
us O
when O
we O
got O
up O
and O
asked O
her O
to O
. O

Half O
way O
through O
the O
meal B-AS
my O
husband O
had O
to O
go O
to O
the O
bar B-AS
to O
order O
his O
own O
beer B-AS
, O
since O
the O
server B-AS
never O
came O
back O
. O

Additionally O
the O
bar B-AS
upstairs O
is O
picturesque O
and O
spacious O
, O
even O
though O
the O
techno B-AS
music I-AS
is O
horrible O
. O

For O
entrees B-AS
, O
we O
had O
the O
chicken B-AS
with I-AS
string I-AS
beans I-AS
, O
steamed B-AS
stripe I-AS
bass I-AS
with I-AS
ginger I-AS
and I-AS
soy I-AS
sauce I-AS
, O
fried B-AS
rice I-AS
with O
chives O
( O
which O
I O
LOVED O
! O

Our O
Peruvian O
waiter B-AS
was O
very O
nice O
, O
and O
the O
food B-AS
was O
ok O
, O
but O
forget O
about O
ordering O
an O
expensive O
bottle B-AS
of I-AS
wine I-AS
there O
. O

We O
sat O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
so O
the O
service B-AS
wasn O
' O
t O
too O
bad O
. O

The O
dessert B-AS
was O
as O
good O
as O
the O
waiter B-AS
said O
it O
would O
be O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
very O
good O
but O
the O
portions B-AS
are O
pretty O
small O
, O
so O
while O
the O
prices B-AS
are O
low O
, O
the O
place B-AS
is O
not O
quite O
a O
bargain O
it O
seems O
to O
be O
. O

This O
time O
, O
I O
ordered O
the O
tasting O
menu B-AS
and O
the O
only O
two O
dishes B-AS
I O
enjoyed O
were O
the O
squab O
and O
the O
sorbet B-AS
. O

The O
only O
complaint O
I O
have O
is O
that O
the O
tables B-AS
for O
2 O
along O
the O
booth B-AS
are O
very O
close O
together O
so O
it O
wasn O
' O
t O
as O
romantic O
a O
dinner B-AS
as O
we O
wanted O
but O
all O
in O
all O
, O
we O
were O
in O
our O
own O
world O
, O
more O
like O
in O
heaven O
. O

Although O
almost O
the O
entire O
back O
room O
had O
tables B-AS
available O
, O
the O
owner B-AS
made O
people O
wait O
to O
be O
seated O
while O
dragging O
waitresses B-AS
around O
by O
the O
arm O
and O
loudly O
telling O
them O
they O
were O
doing O
things O
wrong O
. O

It O
is O
a O
nice O
diner B-AS
atmosphere I-AS
, O
they O
have O
booths O
all O
around O
and O
a O
couple O
of O
middle O
tables B-AS
. O

There O
' O
s O
no O
bar B-AS
, O
only O
beer O
and O
wine O
, O
and O
you O
' O
re O
likely O
to O
be O
annoyed O
by O
unruly O
Park O
Slope O
offsprings O
, O
so O
come O
late O
and O
enjoy O
the O
smart O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
. O

The O
clientel B-AS
, O
however O
, O
make O
it O
a O
scene O
for O
creative O
, O
talented O
people O
- O
- O
inlcuding O
a O
soon O
- O
to O
- O
be O
- O
famous O
theater O
director O
who O
used O
to O
waitress B-AS
there O
! O

We O
were O
not O
offered O
bread B-AS
and O
the O
host B-AS
did O
not O
apologize O
until O
we O
asked O
for O
another O
update O
45 O
minutes O
later O
. O

Looks O
like O
an O
ordinary O
pizza B-AS
joint O
from O
the O
outside O
, O
but O
the O
back O
room O
has O
excellent O
, O
cheap O
Italian B-AS
food I-AS
, O
and O
the O
owners B-AS
and O
workers B-AS
couldn O
' O
t O
be O
nicer O
. O

To O
make O
matters O
worse O
, O
the O
waitress B-AS
followed O
us O
out O
, O
and O
demanded O
that O
we O
leave O
a O
better O
tip B-AS
. O

The O
bartender B-AS
had O
offered O
us O
ONE O
beer B-AS
on O
the O
house O
for O
our O
troubles O
. O

the O
service B-AS
was O
somewhat O
spotty O
, O
but O
we O
were O
rewarded O
with O
free O
drinks B-AS
and O
the O
waiters B-AS
were O
all O
sweet O
and O
lovely O
, O
genuinely O
french O
- O
speaking O
but O
not O
snooty O
! O

The O
final O
blow O
was O
when O
the O
waiter B-AS
brought O
us O
the O
check O
before O
we O
had O
even O
finished O
dessert B-AS
- O
- O
never O
mind O
that O
the O
only O
reason O
we O
were O
taking O
a O
long O
time O
to O
finish O
the O
meal B-AS
was O
because O
of O
the O
extreme O
delay O
in O
the O
service B-AS
of O
our O
food B-AS
. O

Even O
the O
expensive O
( O
11 O
- O
20 O
$ O
) O
fru O
- O
fru O
drinks B-AS
lacked O
flavor B-AS
and O
quality O
ingredients B-AS
. O

SKIP O
THIS O
PLACE O
FOR O
LUNCH B-AS
, O
BUT O
MAKE O
SURE O
YOU O
GET O
THERE O
FOR O
DINNER B-AS
. O

the O
roll B-AS
was O
great O
as O
usual O
but O
the O
salmon O
was O
old O
the O
tuna B-AS
did O
not O
look O
good O
at O
all O
. O

Corner O
Bistro O
, O
despite O
the O
hoopla O
and O
critical O
praise O
, O
is O
nothing O
more O
than O
a O
burger B-AS
joint O
with O
long O
lines B-AS
. O

After O
dinner B-AS
our O
waiter B-AS
takes O
the O
bill B-AS
and O
the O
manager B-AS
tells O
him O
to O
clear O
our O
table O
so O
that O
we O
could O
leave O
. O

We O
orderes O
and O
our O
food B-AS
took O
about O
1 O
hour O
to O
get O
it O
, O
after O
the O
long O
wait B-AS
. O

Went O
on O
a O
3 O
day O
oyster O
binge O
, O
with O
Fish B-AS
bringing O
up O
the O
closing O
, O
and O
I O
am O
so O
glad O
this O
was O
the O
place B-AS
it O
O O
trip O
ended O
, O
because O
it O
was O
so O
great O
! O

Where O
else O
can O
you O
go O
to O
get O
freshly O
made O
Italian O
food B-AS
at O
ridiculously O
low O
prices B-AS
? O

The O
waiters B-AS
are O
very O
kind O
and O
helpful O
, O
and O
I O
regularly O
get O
something O
on O
the O
house O
- O
coffee B-AS
, O
dessert O
or O
a O
drink O
. O

While O
the O
appetizers B-AS
I O
sampled O
( O
gnocchi O
; O
shrimp O
wrapped O
in O
coconut O
or O
somesuch O
) O
were O
not O
so O
impressive O
( O
the O
gnocchi O
portion O
is O
meager O
and O
overpriced O
) O
, O
my O
table B-AS
was O
100 O
% O
satisfied O
with O
their O
entrees O
too O
. O

The O
food O
was O
good O
, O
the O
service O
was O
fine O
, O
and O
the O
place B-AS
has O
a O
lot O
of O
visual O
atmosphere B-AS
, O
but O
I O
would O
not O
go O
back O
unless O
I O
was O
stuck O
eating O
with O
someone O
I O
didn O
' O
t O
want O
to O
listen O
to O
. O

Although O
our O
waitress B-AS
was O
pleasant O
and O
accomdating O
, O
the O
overpriced O
food B-AS
was O
quite O
the O
opposite O
. O

The O
hostess B-AS
did O
not O
verify O
/ O
review O
the O
menu O
prices O
with O
us O
nor O
did O
they O
inform O
us O
of O
the O
logistics O
of O
the O
brunch B-AS
. O

For O
every O
simple O
winner O
like O
Newport O
steak B-AS
with I-AS
pistachio I-AS
salsa I-AS
verde O
, O
there O
' O
s O
an O
overconceived O
braised B-AS
lamb I-AS
with O
cinnamon O
, O
olives B-AS
and O
cilantro O
or O
a O
meek O
salt O
- O
and O
pepper O
- O
crusted O
shrimp O
with O
citrus B-AS
slices I-AS
. O

The O
front O
desk O
person B-AS
gave O
us O
quite O
a O
struggle O
to O
find O
a O
good O
seat B-AS
. O

When O
I O
read O
some O
of O
the O
reviews O
in O
this O
section O
, O
I O
am O
not O
sure O
if O
they O
had O
diner B-AS
in O
the O
same O
restaurant O
and O
also O
I O
would O
not O
be O
suprise O
if O
they O
decided O
to O
have O
their O
Branzino O
well O
done O
with O
butter B-AS
on O
the O
side O
. O

Nothing O
too O
special O
about O
the O
location O
or O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
, O
but O
DAMN O
, O
the O
pizza B-AS
is O
good O
. O

At O
our O
table O
we O
didn O
' O
t O
get O
any O
bread O
until O
30 O
minutes O
into O
the O
seating B-AS
, O
which O
may O
I O
emphasize O
the O
waiter B-AS
took O
really O
long O
to O
come O
to O
our O
table O
, O
about O
20 O
minutes O
. O

- O
, O
the O
desserts B-AS
are O
sinful O
, O
the O
moroccan O
hospitality O
evident O
in O
the O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
' O
s O
friendliness O
and O
there O
is O
an O
overall O
ambience B-AS
that O
makes O
you O
want O
to O
stay O
all O
night O
! O

Enjoy O
a O
drink B-AS
at O
the O
bar B-AS
over O
fresh O
shucked O
oysters B-AS
. O

Be O
warned O
that O
this O
place O
can O
get O
pretty O
crowded O
, O
though O
the O
$ O
3 O
bloody O
mary O
' O
s O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
and O
the O
killer B-AS
DJ I-AS
make O
the O
wait O
more O
than O
bearable O
. O

I O
did O
not O
like O
the O
place O
because O
: O
- O
it O
took O
the O
waiter B-AS
over O
20 O
min O
to O
take O
our O
order O
and O
then O
over O
an O
hour O
until O
we O
got O
our O
food B-AS
. O

Then O
the O
waiter B-AS
came O
back O
for O
our O
food B-AS
order O
at O
10 O
, O
and O
we O
hadn O
' O
t O
received O
our O
drinks B-AS
yet O
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
did O
not O
take O
a O
drink B-AS
order O
from O
us O
. O

OUr O
waiter B-AS
was O
a O
little O
confused O
about O
how O
to O
serve O
champagne B-AS
. O

Although O
there O
was O
a O
30 O
min O
wait O
I O
didn O
' O
t O
mind O
because O
I O
was O
able O
to O
sit O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
and O
have O
some O
drinks B-AS
while O
talking O
to O
the O
beautiful O
, O
charming O
hostess B-AS
there O
. O

Also O
, O
be O
wary O
of O
what O
time O
of O
the O
day O
you O
go O
; O
around O
dinnertime O
, O
the O
restaurant O
becomes O
a O
jungle O
of O
diners B-AS
and O
hustling O
waitresses B-AS
. O

the O
food B-AS
isn O
' O
t O
spectacular O
, O
but O
I O
have O
yet O
to O
be O
disappointed O
in O
anything O
I O
' O
ve O
been O
served O
, O
and O
there O
' O
s O
a O
definite O
attempt O
by O
the O
kitchen B-AS
to O
keep O
the O
menu B-AS
fresh O
and O
interesting O
. O

All O
in O
all O
this O
is O
a O
place O
that O
attracts O
people O
of O
all O
races O
, O
colors O
and O
economic O
status O
, O
as O
I O
noticed O
suited O
clients O
as O
well O
as O
hippies O
, O
or O
soiled O
clothed O
laborers O
who O
stop O
in O
for O
a O
quick O
good O
meal B-AS
or O
a O
business B-AS
lunch I-AS
or O
dinner B-AS
. O

When O
one O
purchases O
a O
bottle O
of O
wine O
, O
it O
' O
s O
fairly O
common O
practice O
for O
a O
server B-AS
to O
come O
by O
and O
refill O
your O
glass B-AS
, O
but O
not O
the O
case O
here O
; O
2 O
. O

We O
went O
here O
for O
lunch B-AS
a O
couple O
of O
weeks O
ago O
on O
a O
Saturday O
, O
and O
I O
was O
thoroughly O
impressed O
with O
the O
food B-AS
. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
your O
meal B-AS
they O
bring O
a O
fortune O
cookie B-AS
and O
an O
orange B-AS
or I-AS
pineapple I-AS
slice I-AS
. O

Our O
waiter B-AS
was O
less O
then O
welcoming O
when O
taking O
our O
drink B-AS
orders O
( O
apparently O
he O
doesn O
' O
t O
like O
beer B-AS
or O
milkshakes O
) O
. O

It O
was O
absolutely O
delicious O
to O
the O
point O
where O
i O
went O
back O
and O
asked O
for O
a O
variety O
plate B-AS
They O
were O
so O
nice O
to O
accomodate O
me O
and O
gave O
me O
almost O
everything O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
to O
taste O
from O
. O

The O
only O
downer O
was O
the O
fruit B-AS
fondue I-AS
desert O
from O
the O
prie B-AS
fixe I-AS
menu I-AS
wasn O
' O
t O
as O
good O
as O
it O
looked O
( O
the O
chocolate O
was O
runny O
) O
, O
and O
the O
wait B-AS
between O
our O
salad O
and O
main O
course O
was O
too O
long O
. O

Flavors B-AS
range O
from O
standards O
to O
hard O
- O
to O
- O
find O
Italian O
options O
, O
like O
tiramisu B-AS
, O
hazelnut O
and O
zuppa O
inglese O
. O

If O
you O
' O
re O
looking O
for O
barbeque O
like O
Dallas O
BBQ O
( O
soaked O
in O
sauce O
from O
a O
bottle O
, O
generic O
, O
homogeneous O
food B-AS
) O
then O
you O
won O
' O
t O
like O
Blue O
Smoke B-AS
. O

We O
would O
have O
to O
flag O
down O
the O
bored O
looking O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
to O
refill O
our O
tea B-AS
. O

I O
HAVE O
HAD O
LOBSTER B-AS
IN O
FINISTIST O
RESTAURANTS O
IN O
MANHATTAN O
AND O
I O
NEVER O
TASTED O
IT O
AS O
GOOD O
AS O
RIZZO B-AS
. O

The O
food O
OK O
( O
DRY O
fried B-AS
chicken I-AS
, O
overcooked O
pork B-AS
, O
great O
mac B-AS
and I-AS
cheese I-AS
) O
I O
dont O
understand O
the O
high O
rating O
. O

A O
collection O
of O
stormy O
sea B-AS
paintings I-AS
and O
two O
mermaid O
figureheads O
hoisting O
lights O
above O
the O
bar B-AS
set O
a O
lulled O
maritime O
mood O
. O

Not O
just O
that O
tapas B-AS
was O
small O
portions B-AS
( O
duh O
) O
but O
, O
for O
example O
, O
$ O
10 O
piggy O
- O
back O
dates O
only O
came O
with O
6 O
little O
appetizers B-AS
. O

The O
california B-AS
roll I-AS
was O
too O
big O
and O
overfilled O
with O
imitation O
crab B-AS
meat I-AS
, O
so O
it O
' O
s O
not O
the O
best O
I O
had O
. O

Their O
delivery B-AS
of O
fresh O
hot O
pizza B-AS
. O

Try O
Le O
Madeleine O
for O
a O
similar O
price B-AS
but O
much O
better O
food B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
excellent O
so O
long O
as O
you O
like O
Austrian O
cuisine B-AS
. O

It O
' O
s O
a O
place O
for O
the O
owner B-AS
staff I-AS
' O
s O
friends O
, O
so O
if O
you O
' O
re O
not O
one O
of O
them O
, O
you O
' O
re O
in O
for O
a O
wait B-AS
. O

The O
ensuing B-AS
dinner I-AS
was O
definitely O
worth O
the O
wait O
; O
I O
' O
ll O
be O
dreaming O
about O
chef B-AS
Jodi O
Williams O
' O
extraordinary O
fried B-AS
squash I-AS
blossoms I-AS
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

Besides O
the O
price B-AS
, O
here O
are O
some O
other O
annoyances O
: O
bleaching O
the O
floors O
during O
the O
dinner B-AS
and O
automatically O
charging O

All O
my O
favorite O
dim O
sum O
, O
especially O
the O
flaky O
pastry B-AS
that O
contains O
either O
curry B-AS
chicken I-AS
or O
roast B-AS
pork I-AS
. O

the O
pizza B-AS
is O
a O
no O
- O
brainer O
, O
and O
the O
dinners B-AS
are O
drastically O
underrated O
. O

I O
felt O
that O
the O
meat B-AS
had O
little O
flavor B-AS
( O
ribs O
and O
chicken O
) O
and O
as O
result O
I O
had O
to O
use O
A O
ALOT O
of O
their O
bbq B-AS
sauce I-AS
( O
which O
is O
good O
) O
and O
the O
ribs O
were O
not O
falling O
of O
the O
bone O
. O

the O
hostess B-AS
really O
underestimated O
the O
wait O
time O
for O
outdoor B-AS
seating I-AS
and O
never O
apologized O
, O
and O
our O
waitress B-AS
was O
apathetic O
and O
unattentive O
. O

I O
have O
been O
coming O
here O
for O
several O
years O
and O
know O
that O
the O
staff B-AS
and O
bartender O
would O
be O
there O
with O
my O
favorite O
drinks B-AS
and O
dishes B-AS
I O
like O
to O
eat O
and O
drink O
on O
any O
given O
night O
. O

The O
music B-AS
is O
a O
little O
bit O
louder O
, O
but O
the O
food B-AS
is O
excellent O
. O

During O
the O
weekend O
nights O
, O
the O
crowd O
is O
full O
of O
20 O
somethings O
( O
in O
which O
a O
few O
look O
much O
younger O
) O
and O
is O
almost O
Coyote O
Ugly O
style B-AS
where O
ladies O
are O
dancing O
all O
over O
the O
bar B-AS
. O

not O
having O
a O
menu B-AS
was O
rather O
strange O
at O
first O
but O
the O
food B-AS
was O
superb O
. O

decent O
, O
if O
greasy O
, O
fishsticks O
, O
but O
served B-AS
on O
a O
mound O
of O
soggy O
fries B-AS
that O
could O
feed O
about O
5 O
- O
6 O
people O
! O

The O
waiter B-AS
returned O
and O
said O
the O
bartender B-AS
refused O
to O
take O
my O
drink B-AS
back O
because O
there O
was O
nothing O
wrong O
with O
it O
and O
I O
would O
have O
to O
pay O
for O
it O
. O

The O
food O
was O
certainly O
fine O
, O
although O
prices B-AS
were O
high O
by O
any O
standard O
, O
with O
dinner B-AS
for O
four O
being O
over O
$ O
300 O
without O
drinks B-AS
. O

Not O
only O
did O
we O
have O
to O
flag O
the O
waiter B-AS
down O
every O
time O
for O
every O
course O
or O
request O
, O
but O
they O
spilled O
our O
drinks B-AS
twice O
all O
over O
the O
table O
- O
and O
once O
was O
hot O
tea B-AS
. O

Our O
waiter B-AS
didn O
' O
t O
know O
the O
menu B-AS
or O
the O
ingredients B-AS
. O

Service B-AS
was O
a O
tad O
spotty O
, O
but O
the O
food B-AS
was O
VERY O
good O
and O
the O
noise O
never O
detracted O
from O
the O
dining O
experience B-AS
. O

) O
My O
date O
and O
I O
were O
greeted O
by O
the O
host B-AS
and O
informed O
there O
would O
be O
a O
slight O
wait B-AS
. O

The O
restaurant O
was O
recently O
taken O
over O
by O
new O
managment O
and O
, O
having O
eaten O
there O
under O
the O
prior O
management B-AS
, O
I O
can O
say O
that O
the O
quality B-AS
of O
the O
dishes O
has O
improved O
. O

Try O
the O
stir B-AS
fried I-AS
cube I-AS
steak I-AS

, O
or O
the O
Oden O
, O
or O
anything O
else O
you O
want O
to O
try O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
. O

I O
have O
a O
litany O
of O
complaints O
- O
- O
being O
over O
- O
charged O
for O
wine B-AS
that O
I O
didn O
' O
t O
order O
, O
shady O
waiters B-AS
, O
so O
- O
so O
food B-AS
that O
arrived O
at O
the O
table B-AS
luke O
warm O
, O
main B-AS

portion I-AS
sizes I-AS
barely O
large O
enough O
to O
be O
appetizer B-AS
sizes O
, O
lack O
of O

that O
Mr O
. O

If O
you O
' O
ve O
been O
out O
partying O
and O
have O
a O
yen O
for O
quality O
Korean B-AS
food I-AS
at O
3 O
: O
00am O
, O
there O
' O
s O
a O
table B-AS
waiting I-AS
for O
you O
at O
Kang O
Suh O
Restaurant O
. O

After O
10 O
minutes O
of O
waiting B-AS
, O
he O
finally O
returned O
to O
the O
table B-AS
and O
snootily O
explained O
to O
us O
that O
the O
wine B-AS
he O
had O
opened O
was O
actually O
better O
and O
more O
expensive O
( O
not O
yet O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
of O
course O
) O
, O
but O
he O
would O
charge O
us O
the O
price B-AS
of O
the O
bottle O
we O
had O
originally O
ordered O
. O

sushi B-AS
portions I-AS
were O
bigger O
than O
most O
places O
and O
service B-AS
was O
average O
, O
far O
better O
options O
available O
in O
the O
area O
. O

The O
Food O
There O
' O
s O
no O
need O
to O
slump O
into O
a O
well O
- O
known O
comfort B-AS
zone O
of O
teriyaki B-AS
and O
udon O
. O

The O
staff B-AS
didn O
' O
t O
even O
tell O
us O
( O
college O
kids O
) O
about O
the O
prix B-AS
- I-AS
fixe I-AS
special I-AS
, O
but O
the O
pair O
of O
older O
adults O
sitting O
next O
to O
us O
took O
advantage O
. O

The O
ceviche B-AS
had O
way O
too O
much O
onion B-AS
which O
masked O
the O
flavor B-AS
of O
the O
fish O
. O

Wonton O
dough O
filled O
with O
gently O
steamed O
and O
seasoned B-AS
pork I-AS
are O
common O
but O
add O
this O
amazing O
soup B-AS
to O
the O
wonton O
, O
seal O
it O
and O
serve O
it O
steaming O
hot O
and O
the O
dumpling B-AS
becomes O
new O
again O
. O

In O
Short O
Take O
a O
quick O
trip O
to O
Maine O
at O
this O
classic O
lobster B-AS
pound O
where O
the O
outdoor B-AS
picnic I-AS
tables I-AS
are O
the O
prime O
seats B-AS
in O
summertime B-AS
. O

I O
have O
been O
dining B-AS
at O
Narita O
for O
6 O
years O
and O
have O
thoroughly O
enjoyed O
every O
meal B-AS
. O

The O
Scene B-AS
Behind O
the O
often O
- O
fogged O
windows O
at O
this O
small O
restaurant O
is O
a O
homey O
atmosphere B-AS
, O
full O
of O
smiling O
employees B-AS
and O
Filipino O
families O
crowded O
around O
simple O
red O
tables B-AS
. O

The O
prices B-AS
were O
very O
resonable O
when O
you O
don O
' O
t O
factor O
in O
the O
cost B-AS
of I-AS
beer I-AS
( O
which O
seemed O
to O
be O
on O
the O
high O
side O
) O
. O

The O
$ O
5 O
menu B-AS
does O
have O
smaller O
portions B-AS
, O
and O
I O
found O
the O
ravioli B-AS
dish I-AS
to O
be O
not O
too O
much O
better O
than O
a O
can O
of O
Chef O
Boyardee O
. O

To O
enhance O
the O
dining B-AS
experience O
, O
there O
is O
a O
live B-AS
jazz I-AS
band I-AS
, O
which O
further O
isolates O
you O
from O
the O
world O
outside O
the O
gates O
. O

The O
tasting O
menu B-AS
was O
delivered O
at O
a O
break O
- O
neck O
pace B-AS
, O
leaving O
no O
time O
to O
enjoy O
the O
wine B-AS
or O
even O
digest O
the O
food B-AS
. O

Although O
the O
tables B-AS
may O
be O
closely O
situated O
, O
the O
candle B-AS
- I-AS
light I-AS
, O
food B-AS
- I-AS
quality I-AS
and O
service B-AS
overcompensate O
. O

The O
pasta O
, O
chicken B-AS
and I-AS
veal I-AS
dishes I-AS
are O
one O
of O
the O
best O
values O
in O
town O
, O
almost O
always O
served O
with O
bread B-AS
and I-AS
salad I-AS
( O
and O
pasta O
for O
the O
meat B-AS
dishes I-AS
) O
. O

We O
first O
got O
a O
table B-AS
next O
to O
a O
VERY O
loud O
speaker O
and O
had O
no O
view O
, O
but O
the O
waiter B-AS
was O
kind O
enough O
to O
move O
us O
when O
we O
asked O
. O

The O
portions B-AS
are O
big O
so O
you O
can O
split O
an O
appetizer B-AS
. O

But O
, O
quickly O
all O
would O
realize O
that O
most O
items O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
are O
grease O
- O
laden O
, O
and O
the O
portions B-AS
are O
so O
big O
that O
you O
' O
d O
get O
tired O
of O
the O
flavors B-AS
before O
you O
finish O
half O
a O
plate B-AS
. O

We O
had O
the O
5 O
course O
tasting O
menu O
and O
had O
the O
waiter B-AS
select O
a O
perfect O
bottle B-AS
of I-AS
wine I-AS
to O
go O
with O
our O
selections O
. O

The O
daily B-AS
fresh I-AS
fish I-AS
can O
be O
remarkably O
good O
, O
served O
in O
a O
variety O
of O
combinations O
, O
ranging O
up O
to O
the O
omakase O
chef B-AS
' O
s O
choice O
dinner O
. O

I O
arrived O
with O
one O
other O
person O
at O
~ O
8 O
: O
30 O
on O
a O
Wed O
night O
- O
- O
the O
hostess B-AS
was O
very O
kind O
and O
showed O
me O
the O
reservation B-AS
computer O
which O
showed O
that O
they O
were O
completely O
booked O
. O

Meals B-AS
not O
served B-AS
at O
once O
and O
service B-AS
was O
inattentive O
and O
forgetful O
. O

My O
friends O
and O
I O
made O
plans O
to O
go O
out O
on O
Friday O
for O
some O
good O
latin B-AS
food I-AS
and O
decide O
to O
go O
to O
Yuca O
Bar O
since O
we O
' O
ve O
been O
there O
for O
brunch B-AS
and O
we O
love O
it O
, O
we O
figured O
dinner B-AS
has O
to O
be O
good O
. O

Yet O
, O
it O
still O
took O
over O
an O
hour O
for O
us O
to O
get O
our O
food B-AS
, O
which O
was O
alright O
; O
my O
nephew O
said O
his O
tortellini O
tasted O
like O
Costco O
, O
they O
even O
forgot O
to O
bring O
my O
beverage B-AS
. O

Fish B-AS
and I-AS
tomato I-AS
sauce I-AS
both O
have O
great O
flavors B-AS
and O
the O
dishes B-AS
are O
under O
$ O
20 O
. O

They O
have O
recently O
fired O
their O
staff B-AS
and O
brought O
in O
new O
people O
who O
dont O
even O
know O
how O
to O
serve O
a O
beer B-AS
, O
I O
might O
add O
you O
are O
on O
average O
paying O
$ O
6 O
. O

It O
was O
well O
past O
8 O
pm O
when O
they O
finally O
got O
us O
the O
check O
, O
and O
we O
asked O
for O
free O
rounds O
of O
champagne B-AS
to O
compensate O
for O
the O
poor O
service B-AS
( O
since O
the O
wine B-AS
dinner I-AS
had O
started O
, O
and O
were O
denied O
. O

Inside O
as O
we O
waited O
momentarily O
for O
our O
table B-AS
, O
the O
bartender B-AS
made O
light O
conversation O
as O
he O
made O
our O
drinks B-AS
. O

Don O
' O
t O
know O
about O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
food O
, O
but O
the O
burgers B-AS
are O
one O
of O
New O
York O
' O
s O
hidden O
treats B-AS
. O

we O
told O
our O
waiter B-AS
to O
make O
five O
selections O
for O
each O
of O
us O
, O
and O
he O
decided O
instead O
to O
charge O
us O
for O
each O
glass B-AS
separately I-AS
instead O
( O
$ O
80 O
instead O
of O
$ O
20 O
) O
. O

A O
friendly O
staff B-AS
works O
the O
room B-AS
, O
delivering O
favorites O
like O
crisp O
, O
crackling O
spring B-AS
rolls I-AS
and O
shredded O
pork B-AS
rolls I-AS
wrapped O
in O
rice B-AS
paper I-AS
. O

The O
place B-AS
is O
a O
little O
over O
- O
priced O
for O
brunch B-AS
but O
it O
is O
a O
nice O
restaurant O
so O
that O
was O
expected O
Food O
( O
i O
had O
the O
omelette O
with O
cheddar B-AS
, O
mushrooms B-AS
and O
herbs B-AS
) O
, O
service B-AS
, O
coffee B-AS
, O
atmosphere B-AS
were O
all O
fantastic O
. O

The O
only O
other O
negative O
, O
we O
found O
the O
waiter B-AS
to O
be O
slightly O
pompous O
, O
and O
when O
I O
asked O
him O
some O
very O
basic O
wine B-AS
questions O
, O
he O
was O
lost O
. O

Not O
only O
did O
the O
food O
take O
an O
eternity O
to O
come O
out O
; O
but O
the O
waiter B-AS
never O
checked O
in O
, O
explained O
the O
delay O
for O
the O
food O
, O
or O
refreshed O
our O
drinks B-AS
. O

My O
experience O
at O
the O
The O
Pearl B-AS
Room I-AS
was O
like O
no O
other O
place O
in O
Bay O
Ridge O
, O
you O
walk O
into O
a O
dimly O
lit O
atomsphere O
and O
a O
well O
dressed O
crowd B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
' O
s O
ok O
here O
, O
but O
AVOID O
this O
place O
for O
brunch B-AS
, O
dinner B-AS
or O
any O
other O
time O
! O

For O
dessert B-AS
go O
with O
the O
flan O
as O
the B-AS
chocolate I-AS
cake I-AS
was O
not O
too O
moist O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
service B-AS
was O
slow O
and O
when O
our O
server B-AS
noticed O
we O
had O
not O
received O
our O
entree O
he O
comp O
' O
ed O
us O
two O
delightful O
margaritas O
- O
AND O
charged O
us O
only O
for O
appetizers O
, O
thereby O
cutting O
our O
bill B-AS
in O
half O
. O

The O
owner B-AS
promised O
my O
party O
a O
table B-AS
and O
bottle O
service O
and O
took O
care O
of O
it O
immediately O
as O
we O
all O
arrived O
. O

You O
wanna O
wait B-AS
a O
hour O
for O
a O
cramped O
table B-AS
to O
eat O
mom O
' O
s O
macaroni O
and O
cheese B-AS
? O

The O
Food B-AS
When O
the O
counter B-AS
guy O
asks O
, O
Would O
you O
like O
better O
fries B-AS
with O
that O
? O

Please O
, O
please O
don O
' O
t O
waste O
your O
money O
( O
85 O
cents O
for O
a O
slice B-AS
of I-AS
tomato I-AS
on O
your O
overpriced O
sandwich B-AS
. O

I O
went O
there O
for O
lunch B-AS
a O
couple O
of O
times O
but O
whenever O
I O
went O
there O
( O
even O
though O
we O
pinpointed O
our O
order O
on O
menu B-AS
) O
, O
waitress B-AS
messed O
up O
our O
order O
and O
they O
never O
said O
sorry O
. O

What O
made O
our O
visit O
extra O
special O
was O
that O
we O
didn O
' O
t O
have O
room O
for O
dessert B-AS
at O
the O
end O
of O
our O
meal O
( O
the O
pasta B-AS
was O
so O
amazing O
we O
just O
kept O
eating O
) O
, O
our O
waiter B-AS
suggested O
we O
come O
back O
after O
our O
show O
, O
which O
we O
did O
. O

the O
place B-AS
had O
open B-AS
doors I-AS
and O
windows O
and O
a O
very O
relaxed O
, O
candle O
- O
lit O
type O
of O
atmosphere B-AS
. O

Two O
minutes O
later O
, O
the O
waitress B-AS
said O
we O
NEED O
the O
table O
, O
you O
can O
not O
have O
the O
appetizer B-AS
that O
you O
ordered O
. O

Grabbed O
a O
lunch B-AS
here O
on O
a O
weekday O
and O
it O
was O
reasonably O
priced B-AS
, O
well O
- O
portioned O
and O
generally O
well O
- O
prepared O
. O

Fortunately O
, O
unlike O
many O
Mexican B-AS
joints O
, O
the O
abundance B-AS
of I-AS
cheese I-AS
never O
tastes O
greasy O
, O
and O
portions B-AS
are O
filling O
but O
not O
overwhelming O
. O

Thought O
I O
didn O
' O
t O
have O
reservations B-AS
, O
the O
hostess B-AS
politely O
informed O
me O
that O
it O
would O
be O
a O
45 O
minute O
wait O
and O
we O
were O
actually O
seated O
in O
40 O
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
never O
once O
came O
back O
to O
our O
table O
to O
ask O
how O
our O
meal B-AS
was O
OR O
if O
we O
needed O
another O
drink O
. O

Their O
desserts B-AS
were O
limited O
- O
I O
mean O
REALLY O
limited O
to O
2 O
items O
( O
nothing O
like O
the O
online O
menu B-AS
) O
. O

I O
haven O
' O
t O
eat O
a O
lamb B-AS
chop I-AS
as O
delicious O
as O
that O
, O
the O
salads B-AS
are O
really O
nice O
dressed O
with O
lemon B-AS
and O
extra B-AS
virgnin I-AS
olive I-AS
oil I-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
and O
our O
server B-AS
( O
s O
) O
were O
very O
very O
excellent O
, O
prices B-AS
were O
very O
good O
, O
but O
she O
' O
s O
just O
left O
a O
horrible O
taste B-AS
in O
our O
mouth O
both O
times O
. O

My O
one O
recommendation O
is O
try O
not O
to O
geta O
seat B-AS
by O
the O
door B-AS
, O
there O
is O
a O
large O
brass O
bell O
that O
people O
like O
to O
whale O
on O
when O
they O
leave O
the O
place O
. O

Although O
all O
of O
the O
menu B-AS
items I-AS
and O
specials B-AS
always O
sound O
tantalizing O
, O
we O
often O
end O
up O
ordering O
the O
pastaless B-AS
eggplant I-AS
lasagna I-AS
and O
the O
gnocchi B-AS
souffle I-AS
. O

the O
service B-AS
was O
very O
slow O
and O
his O
knowledge O
of O
the O
menu B-AS
wasnt O
that O
good O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
that O
lunch B-AS
can O
take O
a O
loooooong O
time O
as O
the O
waiters B-AS
seem O
to O
forget O
food O
orders O
, O
forget O
drink O
orders O
, O
and O
forget O
to O
refill O
water B-AS
glasses I-AS
. O

Second O
, O
the O
value B-AS
was O
great O
; O
after O
ordering O
a O
ton O
of O
food B-AS
and O
several O
drinks O
, O
the O
bill B-AS
still O
came O
to O
less O
than O
$ O
40 O
a O
person O
( O
though O
I O
suspect O
that O
the O
nice O
manager O
might O
have O
given O
us O
a O
few O
freebees O
! O

Great O
place O
to O
get O
a O
good O
fulfilling B-AS
meal I-AS
but O
do O
not O
go O
for O
ambience B-AS
or O
service B-AS
. O

I O
would O
feel O
different O
if O
we O
were O
just O
drinking O
water B-AS
and O
eating O
cake O
but O
we O
had O
20 O
people O
drinking O
multiple O
overpriced O
beverages B-AS
AND O
one O
friend O
had O
called O
ahead O
of O
time O
to O
find O
out O
about O
the O
cake O
and O
no O
one O
ever O
picked O
up O
the O
phone O
. O

All O
the O
dishes B-AS
that O
we O
had O
at O
our O
table B-AS
were O
consistently O
good O
, O
although O
not O
great O
( O
nor O
poor O
, O
either O
) O
. O

Though O
the O
celery B-AS
root I-AS
soup I-AS
was O
super O
yummy O
- O
everything O
else O
was O
an O
overpriced O
letdown O
- O
the O
plates B-AS
come O
out O
looking O
like O
it O
' O
s O
the O
depression O
era B-AS
. O

We O
waited O
an O
hour O
for O
our O
appetizers B-AS
, O
( O
I O
suspect O
the O
waitress B-AS
forgot O
to O
put O
in O
our O
order O
because O
the O
restaurant O
was O
not O
busy O
) O
and O
then O
the O
entrees B-AS
came O
at O
the O
same O
time O
! O

After O
they O
were O
done O
poking O
and O
prodding O
our O
food B-AS
, O
the O
waiter B-AS
took O
it O
right O
from O
their O
table O
and O
tried O
to O
give O
it O
to O
us O
. O

On O
top O
of O
it O
all O
, O
I O
was O
with O
family O
from O
out O
of O
town O
and O
the O
only O
reason O
I O
took O
them O
there O
was O
because O
a O
friend O
had O
mentioned O
the O
place B-AS
and O
Coffee B-AS
Shop O
had O
a O
little O
wait B-AS
. O

The O
portion B-AS
size I-AS
/ I-AS
price I-AS
combo I-AS
makes O
it O
expensive O
if O
you O
' O
re O
really O
hungry O
, O
but O
we O
went O
for O
a O
late O
dinner B-AS
. O

Still O
the O
bill B-AS
was O
close O
to O
$ O
300 O
( O
with O
1 O
bottle O
of O
lower O
- O
priced O
wine B-AS
) O
. O

We O
have O
been O
waiting B-AS
for O
months O
for O
a O
8pm O
reservation B-AS
at O
this O
very O
average O
restaurant O
. O

bartenders B-AS
management I-AS
and O
at O
first O
were O
a O
bit O
disappointed O
with O
food B-AS
. O

They O
' O
ve O
got O
some O
of O
the O
best O
french O
toast O
you O
' O
ll O
ever O
eat O
for O
Sunday O
brunch B-AS
, O
and O
while O
their O
dinner B-AS
menu I-AS
hasn O
' O
t O
changed O
much O
in O
the O
past O
few O
years O
, O
their O
food B-AS
is O
reliable O
and O
they O
I O
always O
find O
something O
new O
in O
their O
chicken B-AS
or O
fish O
specials O
, O
which O
are O
usually O
prepared O
with O
a O
red O
or O
white B-AS
wine I-AS
- I-AS
based I-AS
sauce I-AS
. O

Plus O
, O
everything O
comes O
in O
small O
to O
average O
portions B-AS
, O
so O
the O
next O
time O
you O
get O
a O
sushi B-AS
craving O
, O
I O
don O
' O
t O
recommend O
that O
you O
go O
here O
. O

He O
prepares O
the O
most O
authentic O
dishes B-AS
, O
I O
guess O
that O
' O
s O
why O
the O
bar B-AS
is O
usually O
filled O
with O
Japanese O
. O

If O
you O
hate O
waiting B-AS
for O
a O
table B-AS
, O
then O
get O
take O
- O
out O
just O
around O
the O
corner O
next O
door B-AS
. O

I O
' O
ve O
eaten O
at O
this O
Zen O
Palate O
location B-AS
a O
few O
times O
, O
and O
each O
time O
have O
had O
the O
same O
reaction O
- O
I O
feel O
the O
food B-AS
' O
s O
sub O
- O
par O
, O
but O
decide O
to O
give O
it O
another O
chance O
and O
order O
something O
else O
. O

My O
next O
thought O
was O
god O
i O
could O
use O
a O
few O
drinks B-AS
and O
a O
bathroom B-AS
. O

I O
had O
to O
try O
the O
sweet B-AS
tea I-AS
, O
which O
was O
served B-AS
in O
a O
plastic O
cup B-AS
at O
room O
temperture O
. O

I O
had O
to O
chase O
down O
our O
waitress B-AS
for O
the O
food B-AS
and O
the O
bill O
. O

the O
sushi O
is O
so O
- O
so O
, O
the O
70s O
orange O
- O
themed O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
2000ish O
, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
reason O
for O
the O
staff B-AS
' O
s O
attitude B-AS
. O

I O
found O
that O
the O
food B-AS
variety I-AS
was O
great O
, O
and O
the O
waitress B-AS
was O
very O
accommodating O
to O
my O
vegan O
boyfriend O
describing O
all O
items O
' O
ingredients B-AS
and O
how O
you O
may O
request O
more O
of O
what O
YOU O
like O
, O
creating O
a O
unique O
experience O
. O

Be O
careful O
with O
the O
waiting O
list O
- O
the O
hostess B-AS
skipped O
over O
our O
party O
on O
the O
list O
as O
we O
sat O
waiting O
for O
a O
table B-AS
, O
for O
over O
an O
hour O
. O

we O
literally O
waited O
for O
over O
45 O
minutes O
to O
finally O
getting O
our O
sushi B-AS
which O
was O
pretty O
simple O
rolls B-AS
. O

We O
were O
rudely O
told O
by O
the O
waiter B-AS
that O
chips B-AS
are O
only O
available O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
. O

You O
cannot O
beat O
having O
the O
waiter B-AS
spooning I-AS
butter I-AS
over O
your O
steak B-AS
before O
you O
are O
served O
! O
! O

My O
roommate O
says O
she O
has O
had O
good O
food B-AS
here O
at O
night O
, O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
. O

The O
service O
was O
average O
and O
the O
tables B-AS
are O
really O
close O
together O
( O
but O
who O
cares O
when O
the O
food B-AS
is O
this O
good O
) O
. O

the O
setup O
is O
cool O
with O
pool O
table O
and O
chill O
area B-AS
in O
front O
and O
dining B-AS
on O
side O
and O
back O
. O

It O
' O
s O
a O
quiet O
crowd O
but O
if O
you O
just O
want O
to O
relax O
, O
get O
a O
bottle B-AS
of I-AS
wine I-AS
and O
some O
great O
tapas B-AS
, O
this O
is O
the O
place O
. O

I O
ordered O
a O
dirty O
martini B-AS
that O
was O
not O
dirty O
at O
all O
- O
and O
when O
I O
asked O
the O
waitress B-AS
to O
make O
it O
dirtier O
, O
instead O
of O
reshaking O
/ O
making O
it O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
, O
she O
broght O
me O
over O
some O
olive O
juice O
in O
a O
cup O
! O
? O

Small O
dishes B-AS
, O
a O
bit O
pricier O
than O
you O
' O
d O
pay O
in O
Miami B-AS
or O
LA O
, O
but O
the O
atomsphere O
is O
on O
the O
sexy O
side O
( O
however O
pared O
down O
) O
and O
its O
cozy O
. O

I O
go O
generally O
with O
one O
friend O
but O
on O
occasion O
have O
popped O
in O
with O
more O
, O
if O
a O
table B-AS
is O
not O
possible O
, O
as O
they O
are O
booked O
solid O
every O
night O
, O
well O
, O
the O
food O
and O
service B-AS
is O
just O
as O
over O
- O
the O
- O
top O
amazing O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
or O
in O
the O
lounge O
as O
it O
is O
in O
the O
dining O
room O
. O

You O
can O
get O
a O
completely O
delish O
martini B-AS
in I-AS
a O
glass O
( O
that O
' O
s O
about O
2 O
1 O
/ O
2 O
drinks B-AS
) O
for O
$ O
8 O
. O

The O
collard B-AS
greens I-AS
were O
tasty O
, O
but O
in O
too O
much O
liquid O
that O
made O
it O
seem O
more O
like O
a O
soup B-AS
. O

The O
greens B-AS
were O
ok O
, O
but O
probably O
were O
too O
salty O
for O
those O
who O
don O
' O
t O
hail O
from O
the O
south O
( O
I O
do O
) O
or O
don O
' O
t O
have O
access O
to O
authentic O
southern B-AS
cooking I-AS
. O

Mussels B-AS
in I-AS
bread I-AS
pot I-AS
, O
homemade B-AS
ravioli I-AS
filled I-AS
with O
things O
like O
swordfish B-AS
and O
truffles B-AS
, O
orange O
- O
ginger O
shrimp O
and O
pizzas B-AS
from O
a O
wood O
- O
burning O
oven O
in O
back O
are O
all O
recommended O
. O

The O
bar B-AS
area I-AS
was O
fairly O
crowded O
but O
service B-AS
remained O
friendly O
and O
efficient O
. O

However O
, O
our O
one O
and O
only O
complaint O
was O
when O
I O
received O
my O
drink B-AS
I O
gave O
my O
coupon O
to O
our O
waiter B-AS
, O
he O
returned O
minutes O
later O
to O
tell O
me O
that O
it O
could O
not O
be O
used O
in O
the O
dining B-AS
room I-AS
, O
only O
at O
the O
lounge O
or O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
. O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
classy O
with O
salsa B-AS
music I-AS
in O
the O
background O
. O

Tasting O
menu B-AS
a O
mixed B-AS
bag I-AS
: O
lobster B-AS
soup I-AS
amuse O
with O
grapefruit O
intriguing O
, O
but O
marred O
by O
excess O
bitterness O
as O
prepared O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
nice O
- O
it O
' O
s O
all O
dark O
wood O
with O
the O
bar B-AS
in O
the O
front O
. O

The O
New O
Prospect O
Cafe O
pretends O
to O
be O
fancy O
and O
the O
prices B-AS
indicate O
fancy O
, O
but O
the O
food B-AS
is O
mediocre O
at O
best O
and O
the O
service B-AS
is O
terrible O
. O

Even O
some O
of O
the O
staff B-AS
that O
was O
working O
that O
night O
was O
served O
their O
dinner O
before O
my O
table O
got O
our O
dinner B-AS
entrees I-AS
. O

When O
we O
sat O
down O
- O
our O
waiter B-AS
did O
not O
know O
what O
to O
recommend O
- O
neither O
food B-AS
nor O
wine B-AS
. O

The O
Food B-AS
The O
fun O
factor O
is O
high O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
of O
experimental O
, O
multi O
- O
ethnic O
shared O
plates O
. O

We O
had O
reservations B-AS
, O
and O
so O
did O
the O
strangers O
, O
and O
yet O
the O
management B-AS
claimed O
the O
other O
tables B-AS
were O
reserved O
. O

And O
Mondays O
fajita B-AS
are O
half O
price B-AS
all O
night O
. O

After O
being O
treated O
like O
we O
were O
at O
Nobu O
by O
the O
hostess B-AS
, O
our O
waitress B-AS
brought O
us O
our O
check O
before O
we O
even O
asked O
for O
it O
and O
denied O
us O
a O
2nd O
round O
of O
drinks B-AS
because O
. O

There O
is O
always O
a O
fun O
and O
friendly O
crowd B-AS
at O
the O
bar B-AS
, O
mostly O
locals O
, O
if O
you O
just O
want O
to O
come O
by O
for O
happy O
hour O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
the O
food B-AS
along O
with O
the O
unhelpful O
service B-AS
doesn O
' O
t O
make O
up O
for O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
. O

I O
did O
not O
find O
the O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
to O
rude O
at O
all O
, O
how O
involved O
do O
you O
really O
want O
them O
in O
your O
meal B-AS
right O
? O

In O
April O
, O
the O
service B-AS
was O
fair O
but O
again O
, O
the O
food B-AS
was O
at O
best O
only O
warm O
. O

not O
only O
were O
we O
waiting B-AS
for O
half O
an O
hour O
with O
reservations B-AS
, O
once O
we O
got O
seated O
we O
waited O
another O
15 O
+ O
minutes O
for O
the O
waiter B-AS
to O
come O
and O
take O
out O
drink O
menu B-AS
. O

The O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
is O
good O
, O
and O
overall O
it O
is O
not O
too O
expensive O
, O
though O
, O
and O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
very O
dark O
and O
brick O
- O
covered O
, O
much O
like O
any O
damp O
basement O
. O

The O
cranberry B-AS
sauce I-AS
was O
unrecognizable O
in O
taste B-AS
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
was O
attentive O
but O
not O
overbearing O
and O
gave O
good O
recommendations O
on O
the O
cocktails B-AS
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
I O
would O
not O
recommend O
for O
the O
food O
or O
drinks B-AS
but O
I O
guess O
I O
can O
' O
t O
expect O
better O
for O
the O
prices B-AS
. O

) O
Scores O
of O
employees B-AS
walking O
around O
, O
but O
no O
one O
seems O
to O
clear O
a O
plate O
or O
offer O
more O
drinks B-AS
. O

Within O
10 O
minutes O
of O
being O
seated B-AS
at O
our O
table O
, O
the O
hostess B-AS
asked O
us O
if O
we O
could O
move O
. O

before O
we O
could O
say O
anything O
, O
one O
waiter B-AS
picked O
it O
up O
while O
another O
brought O
a O
knife O
to O
our O
table B-AS
on O
a O
platter B-AS
. O

Low O
- O
fat O
and O
low O
- O
carb O
options B-AS
( O
such O
as O
flatbread O
) O
lure O
in O
health O
- O
conscious O
diners B-AS
, O
while O
everyone O
else O
can O
sink O
their O
teeth O
into O
warm O
, O
crispy O
baguettes O
piled O
with O
mesquite B-AS
chicken I-AS
or O
smoked B-AS
turkey I-AS
, O
Philly B-AS
cheese I-AS
steaks I-AS
and O
more O
. O

Order O
a O
beer B-AS
and O
then O
sit O
and O
wait O
for O
the O
steamy O
, O
salty O
soup B-AS
dumplings I-AS
that O
burst O
with O
a O
snap O
. O

He O
may O
be O
a O
little O
hard O
to O
take O
, O
but O
he O
knows O
how O
to O
run O
a O
kitchen B-AS
and O
put O
together O
a O
creative O
menu B-AS
. O

If O
you O
can O
get O
a O
corner B-AS
table I-AS
you O
can O
see O
the O
entire O
room B-AS
while O
eating O
in O
elegance O
. O

We O
were O
seated O
next O
to O
some O
obnoxious O
women O
who O
bogarted O
the O
server B-AS
' O
s O
time O
and O
attention O
, O
so O
he O
bought O
us O
drinks B-AS
. O

If O
you O
order O
the O
platters B-AS
all O
of O
your O
typical O
Indian B-AS
side I-AS
items I-AS
are O
included O
so O
it O
is O
a O
good O
value O
. O

Eventually O
another O
waiter B-AS
cleaned O
up O
the O
table B-AS
and O
allowed O
us O
to O
sit O
there O
. O

I O
liked O
the O
overall O
setting B-AS
A O
LOT O
and O
it O
was O
only O
improved O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
our O
waiter B-AS

Its O

THE O
SERVICE B-AS
WAS O
CIVILIZED O
INFORMATIVE O
; O
WE O
NEVER O
FELT O
RUSHED O
, O
EVEN O
THOUGH O
PATRONS O
WERE O
WAITING B-AS
TO O
BE O
SEATED O
. O

We O
had O
to O
wait O
30 O
- O
45mins O
after O
we O
were O
already O
seated O
to O
get O
our O
orders O
in O
, O
waited O
what O
felt O
like O
an O

to O

our O

was O
not O
given O
utensils O
with O
our O
dinner B-AS
( O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
that O
too O
) O
, O
and O
had O
the O
wrong O
dessert B-AS
brought O
to O
our O
table O
and O
never O
remedied O
even O
after O
we O
brought O
it O
to O
the O
waiter B-AS
' O
s O
attention O
. O

Sure O
, O
you O
can O
sit O
back O
and O
watch O
the O
celebrites O
pour O
in O
, O
or O
sit O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
, O
and O
watch O
true O
masters O
create O
old O
world O
sushi O
, O
and O
new O
world O
rolls B-AS
. O

None O
of O
us O
were O
able O
to O
get O
drinks B-AS
in O
a O
timely O
fashion O
, O
and O
the O
bartender B-AS
was O
EXTREMELY O
rude O
to O
us O
. O

For O
appetizers B-AS
, O
we O
shared O
summer O
rolls O
and O
spring B-AS
rolls I-AS
- O
they O
were O
good O
, O
not O
great O
. O

He O
is O
a O
gracious O
chef B-AS
who O
comes O
to O
the O
table B-AS
and O
greets O
the O
guests O
. O

Just O
look O
at O
all O
those O
people O
waiting B-AS
outside O
to O
feat O
in O
an O
unadorned O
space B-AS
of O
cramped O
shared O
tables O
? O

The O
appetizers B-AS
were O
tasty O
and O
the O
snail B-AS
ravioli I-AS
quite O
adventurous O
, O
however O
the O
main O
courses O
were O
quite O
bland O
and O
even O
though O
the O
steak O
was O
featured O
with O
mustard B-AS
sauce I-AS
it O
really O
was O
just O
plain O
stone O
ground O
mustard O
. O

There O
is O
no O
pretention O
here O
, O
no O
tofu B-AS
, O
no O
foie B-AS

, O
and O
no O
vegi O

, O
just O
a O
straight O

with O
great O
meat B-AS
cooked O
perfectly O
. O

On O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
unusual O
offerings O
like O
mango B-AS
salad I-AS
, O
Kashmiri B-AS
chicken I-AS
and O
whole O
fish O
cooked O
in O
mustard B-AS

refute O
the O
strip O
' O
s O
infamous O
reputation O
for O
one O
- O
sauce O
- O
fits O
- O
all O
cooking B-AS
. O

I O
asked O
one O
waitress B-AS
if O
I O
could O
change O
tables B-AS
and O
she O
didn O
' O
t O
say O
no O
outright O

The O
Scene O
Though O
this O
looks O

with O
purple O
vinyl O
booths O
and O
a O
koi O
pond O
in O
the O
small O
dining B-AS
room I-AS
, O
there O
are O
glimpses O
of O
superiority O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
the O
potato B-AS
and I-AS
cheese I-AS
pierogis O
and O
the O
polish B-AS
kielbasa I-AS
entreesbut O
the O
real O
stars O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
are O
the O
sides O
. O

I O
have O
to O
say O
the O
seating B-AS
at O
the O
bar O
and O
dining B-AS
areas I-AS
are O
very O
nice O
and O
the O
service B-AS
is O
exceptional O
. O

The O
waitstaff B-AS
is O
nice O
, O
but O
is O
pushy O
and O
seemed O
irritated O
when O
we O
did O
not O
order O

( O
we O
already O
had O
a O

ordered O

entrees O
) O
. O

The O
East O
Side O
is O
a O
little O
fancier O
and O
larger O
, O
but O
still O
a O
Wonderland O
with O
the O
same O
great O
food B-AS
, O
scones B-AS
, O

and O
more O
- O
a O

and O
drinks B-AS
like O
Mar B-AS

It O
' O
s O
also O
a O
good O
place O
to O
unwind O
after O
dinner B-AS
and O
have O
some O
coffee B-AS
and O
cake B-AS
. O

The O
menus B-AS
took O
about O
15 O
minutes O
to O
come O

the O
menu O
were O
already O
set O
up O
for O
Valentines O

the O
salad B-AS
was O
good O
my O
dinner B-AS
was O
a O
soup B-AS
of O
about O
2 O
or O
three O
shrimps B-AS
, O
THAT O
' O
S O
IT O
! O

For O
as O
busy O
as O
this O
place O
is O
, O
the O
owner B-AS
could O
afford O
to O
hire O
additional O
servers B-AS
. O

Just O
make O
sure O
you O
make O
reservations B-AS
a O
few O
days O
in O
advance O
because O
there O
aren O
' O
t O
a O
lot O
of O
tables B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
good O
and O
cheap O
BUT O
the O
attitudes O
of O
the O
bartender B-AS
and O
wait O
staff O
are O
almost O
unbearable O
. O

Well O
, O
literally O
7 O
minutes O
later O
we O
were O
being O
served B-AS
dinner I-AS
, O
with O
no O
apologies O
from O
the O
server B-AS
who O
was O
too O
scared O
to O
come O
to O
our O
table B-AS
. O

The O
food O
is O
average O
, O
at O
best O
( O
I O
have O
been O
repeatedly O
underwhelmed O
by O
the O
mediocre O
fare B-AS
) O
and O
the O
service B-AS
is O
only O
good O
if O
Elaine O
is O
within O

She O
walked O

had O
the O

pass O
on O
the O

The O
Food B-AS
The O
menu B-AS
seems O
quirky O
, O
but O
upon O
a O
closer O
look O
ingredients B-AS
are O
familiar O
and O
made O
into O
appealing O
combinations O
, O
with O
influences O
from O
Maine O
to O
the O
Mediterranean O
. O

However O
, O
the O
wait B-AS
was O
worth O
it O
, O
the O
food B-AS
was O
just O
great O
- O
make O
sure O
you O

the O

THE O
DECOR B-AS
HAS O
BEEN O
UPDATED O
TO O
A O
FULL O
BLOWN O
RESTAURANT O
BUT O
THE O
QUALITY B-AS
AND O
THE O

CHANGED O

the O

( O
SUPRISE O
! O
! O
! O
) O

The O
only O
downfall O
was O
that O
our O
appetizer B-AS
never O
showed O
up O
, O
we O
were O
apologized O
to O
, O
and O
it O
wasn O
' O

on O
our O

but O
we O
also O
didn O
' O
t O
get O
the O

we O
were O
all O
craving O
. O

Our O
cocktails B-AS
were O
ok O
but O
at O
ridiculous O
dance O

prices B-AS
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
the O
bartender B-AS
continued O
to O
pour O
champagne B-AS
from O
his O
reserve O
after O
we O
had O
finished O
our O
bottle O
and O
we O
enjoyed O
an O

with I-AS
pureed I-AS

, O
gratis O
. O

It O
' O

listed O
under O
appetizers B-AS
, O
but O
it O
' O
s O
definitely O
filling O
enough O
to O
have O
as O
a O
meal B-AS
. O

Our O
dinner B-AS
took O
over O
two O
hours O
because O
of O
the O
slow O
service B-AS
. O

Service B-AS
is O
wonderful O
- O
I O
' O
ve O
sat O
there O
for O
over O
3 O
hours O
at O
dinner B-AS
and O
never O
felt O
rushed O
to O
leave O
. O

My O
first O
and O
LAST O
visit O
included O
a O
waiter B-AS
telling O
me O
We O
' O

then O

cost I-AS
but O
passable O
to O
rude O
service B-AS
, O
depending O
on O
who O
you O
get O
. O

The O
price B-AS
is O
cheap O
- O
5 O
dumplings B-AS
for O
$ O
1 O
. O

the O
waiters B-AS
had O
a O
really O
hard O
time O
remembering O
to O
bring O

and O
when O
they O
did O
they O

by O

and O
the O

but O
my O

quick O
to O
help O

I O
was O
bored O
by O
the O
club B-AS
scene I-AS
and O
too O
overdressed O
for O
the O
local O
bar B-AS
. O

I O
had O
a O
burger B-AS
which O
was O
great O
and O
my O

a O

Anyhow O

there O
were O
a O
lot O
of O
Japanese O
people O
seated B-AS
at O
the O
bar B-AS
, O
eating O
chatting O
up O
the O

surely O
that O

a O
good O

Food B-AS
was O
good O
but O
portions B-AS
were O
quite O
tiny O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
awesome O
if O
you O
can O
deal O
with O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
who O
you O
can O
hardly O

find O

We O

who O
actually O
called O
in O

At O
the O

of O
our O

I O
approached O

asked O
that O

Good O
brunch B-AS
menu I-AS
- O
it O
was O
hard O
to O
make O
a O
decision O
between O
the O
breakfast O
tacos O
, O
huevos O
rancheros O
, O
and O
salads B-AS
on O
the O
menu O
although O
our O
waiter O
was O
happy O
to O
rank O
menu O
items O
upon O
our O
request O
. O

Orange B-AS
Valve I-AS
is O
probably O
the O
best O
bar B-AS
that O
I O
' O
ve O
been O
to O
in O
a O
while O
. O

The O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
were O
incredibly O
attentive O
, O
though O
as O
a O
warning O
, O
if O
you O
like O
wine B-AS
, O
but O
also O
a O
little O
privacy B-AS
, O
this O
might O
not O
be O
a O
good O
idea O
, O
since O
they O
have O
the O
tendency O
to O
hover O
a O
bit O
. O

Although O
the O
prices B-AS
are O
kind O
of O
high O
for O
lunch O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
nice O
. O

I O
used O
to O
eat O
there O
two O
meals B-AS
a O
day O
until O
my O
company O
moved O
to O
stupid O
Madison O
avenue O
( O
UGH O
, O
nasty O
food B-AS
for O
rip O
off O
tourist O
price B-AS
! O
) O

Special O
touch O
- O
- O
my O
dessert B-AS
plate I-AS
had O
Happy O
Birthday O
drizzled O
in O
chocolate B-AS
. O

Another O
quick O
tell O
- O
tale O
sign O
is O
the O
furniture B-AS
at O
the O
bar B-AS
and O
the O
seating O
tables O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
had O
the O
same O
steak B-AS
at O
Peter O
Lugers O
for O
double O
the O
price B-AS
. O

The O
staff B-AS
has O
been O
nice O
, O
but O
they O
seemed O
really O
stressed O
and O
the O
unisex O
bathroom B-AS
needs O
to O
be O
cleaned O
more O
often O
. O

YYMV O
, O
we O
visited O
for O
Restaurant O
Week O
so O
the O
quality B-AS
of O
the O
food B-AS
may O
have O
been O
below O
normal O
standards O
because O
of O
the O
crowds O
. O

When O
we O
asked O
the O
waiter B-AS
for O
water B-AS
- O
he O
gave O
us O
dirty O
looks O
and O
it O
took O
at O
least O
15 O
minutes O
to O
get O
it O
. O

Many O
meals B-AS
were O
delivered O
by O
two O
servers B-AS
, O
besides O
having O
a O
waiter B-AS
to O
oversea O
the O
process O
. O

The O
best O
thing O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
was O
probably O
the O
creamed B-AS
spinach I-AS
side O
and O
that O
' O
s O
saying O
alot O
for O
a O
steakhouse O
. O

We O
picked O
on O
a O
bunch O
of O
different O
appetizers B-AS
as O
dinner B-AS
and O
everything O
was O
yummy O
. O

Unfortunately O
it O
gets O
very O
crowded O
on O
the O
weekends O
, O
so O
if O
you O
don O
' O
t O
mind O
dining B-AS
at O
the O
bar O
you O
can O
skip O
the O
wait B-AS
for O
a O
table B-AS
. O

Chef B-AS
Richard O
is O
always O
eager O
to O
please O
, O
and O
will O
be O
happy O
make O
something O
special O
' O
off O
the O
menu B-AS
' O
if O
you O
ask O
. O

The O
chick B-AS
pea I-AS
/ I-AS
eggplant I-AS
dish I-AS
was O
quite O
bland O
, O
and O
the O
saag B-AS
paneer I-AS
was O
a O
huge O
disappointment O
- O
- O
more O
like O
some O
kid O
' O
s O
worst O
experience O
of O
creamed O
spinach B-AS
with O
tofu B-AS
- I-AS
like I-AS
cheese I-AS
. O

I O
took O
a O
friend O
for O
dinner B-AS
for O
his O
birthday O
here O
and O
the O
food B-AS
was O
amazing O
. O

Not O
in O
the O
mood O
for O
sushi B-AS
, O
try O
the O
fantastic O
okonomiyake B-AS
. O

This O
coffee B-AS
shop O
offers O
many O
varieties O
of O
food B-AS
. O

I O
thought O
the O
service O
was O
a O
little O
slow O
and O
not O
attentive O
enough O
for O
the O
price B-AS
but O
other O
than O
that O
I O
' O
ll O
be O
back O
when O
I O
can O
afford O
to O
spend O
$ O
60 O
on O
dinner B-AS
! O

The O
birthday O
girl O
' O
s O
dessert B-AS
included O
a O
candle O
the O
staff B-AS
came O
by O
with O
birthday O
wishes O
. O

Some O
of O
the O
things O
we O
ordered O
were O
The O
Duck B-AS
Spring I-AS
Rolls I-AS
, O
Lobster B-AS
and I-AS
Goat I-AS
Cheese I-AS
Quesadillas I-AS
, O
Wild B-AS
Mushroom I-AS
Ravioli I-AS
and O
the O
concluded B-AS
dinner I-AS
with O
a O
steak B-AS
special I-AS
that O
was O
out O
of O
this O
world O
. O

The O
downside O
is O
that O
perhaps O
due O
to O
rice B-AS
' O
s O
eclectic O
nature O
, O
the O
chef B-AS
has O
trouble O
cooking O
any O
single O
type O
to O
perfection O
. O

My O
friends O
and O
I O
dropped O
by O
on O
a O
Sunday O
, O
and O
there O
was O
absolutely O
NO O
SERVICE B-AS
( O
the O
supposed O
only O
female O
bartender O
even O
told O
us O
there O
was O
no O
one O
else O
but O
her O
, O
and O
given O
that O
there O
were O
people O
in O
there O
waiting O
to O
dine B-AS
and O
drink B-AS
, O
that O
was O
ridicoulas O
! O

We O
loved O
the O
recommendation O
for O
the O
wine B-AS
, O
and O
I O
think O
the O
eggplant B-AS
parmigiana I-AS
appetizer I-AS
should O
become O
an O
entree B-AS
. O

Other O
than O
that O
, O
for O
$ O
30 O
person O
you O
will O
have O
one O
of O
the O
best O
meals B-AS
and O
that O
included O
a O
bottle B-AS
of I-AS
wine I-AS
. O

I O
realized O
that O
you O
dont O
have O
to O
wait O
hours O
and O
pay O
crazy O
prices B-AS
for O
food B-AS
. O

For O
dinner B-AS
, O
I O
love O
the O
churrasco B-AS
and O
halibut B-AS
with I-AS
of I-AS
course I-AS
black I-AS
beans I-AS
and O
yellow O
rice B-AS
. O

Was O
there O
for O
dinner B-AS
last O
night O
, O
and O
the O
food B-AS
was O
great O
. O

The O
menu B-AS
sounded O
good O
but O
the O
grilled B-AS
eggplant I-AS
roll I-AS
was O
oversauced O
with O
a O
pile O
of O
mint O
, O
pork O
chop O
was O
leathery O
, O
and O
everything O
just O
tasted O
wrong O
. O

Service B-AS
is O
coddling O
and O
correct O
and O
there O
' O
s O
no O
sense O
of O
hurry O
, O
so O
diners O
linger O
over O
a O
cheese B-AS
course O
or O
a O
round O
of O
liqueurs O
. O

USC O
has O
a O
cold O
smoker O
and O
smoked O
the O
avocado B-AS
in O
order O
to O
make O
the O
dish B-AS
more O
complex O
. O
