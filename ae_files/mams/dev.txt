After O
a O
couple O
of O
drinks B-AS
, O
the O
apps O
- O
- O
I O
like O
the O
lobster O
/ O
mango O
summer O
roll B-AS
and O
the O
cripsy B-AS
squid I-AS
- O
- O
go O
down O
great O
. O

The O
basil B-AS
pepper I-AS
mojito I-AS
was O
a O
little O
daunting O
in O
concept O
, O
but O
I O
was O
refreshed O
at O
the O
flavor B-AS
. O

Had O
to O
constantly O
ask O
the O
waiter B-AS
to O
top O
up O
water B-AS
glasses I-AS
, O
but O
generally O
service B-AS
was O
ok O
. O

The O
portions B-AS
were O
so O
small O
that O
we O
still O
wanted O
to O
eat O
after O
dinner B-AS
. O

The O
staff B-AS
is O
very O
kind O
and O
well O
trained O
, O
they O
' O
re O
fast O
, O
they O
are O
always O
prompt O
to O
jump O
behind O
the O
bar B-AS
and O
fix O
drinks B-AS
, O
they O
know O
details O
of O
every O
item O
in O
the O
menu B-AS
and O
make O
excelent O
recomendations O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
the O
soup B-AS
was O
so O
clear O
and O
you O
taste O
no O
salt B-AS
. O

We O
went O
out O
on O
the O
town O
with O
the O
idea O
that O
we O
were O
going O
to O
mingle O
with O
the O
in O
crowd O
, O
you O
know O
, O
go O
to O
a O
place O
where O
you O
pay O
an O
outrageous O
cover O
charge O
, O
have O
to O
wear O
all O
black O
to O
fit O
in O
, O
and O
pay O
$ O
12 O
for O
a O
watered B-AS
- I-AS
down I-AS
martini I-AS
, O
and O
if O
you O
' O
re O
lucky O
, O
have O
a O
good O
time B-AS
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
had O
a O
slight O
attitude B-AS
and O
brought O
our O
wine B-AS
aprroximately O
10 O
minutes O
into O
our O
appetizer B-AS
. O

Appetizers B-AS
and O
entrees O
were O
merely O
adequate O
, O
but O
you O
can O
' O
t O
beat O
the O
pool O
room O
for O
atmosphere B-AS
. O

However O
for O
the O
price B-AS
I O
paid O
to O
have O
dinner B-AS
there O
, O
you O
would O
have O
thought O
I O
ate O
a O
horse O
. O

I O
called O
to O
confirm O
the O
reservations O
on O
the O
morning O
of O
the O
lunch B-AS
and O
the O
hostess B-AS
had O
the O
reservations O
set O
for O
12 O
: O
30pm O
which O
I O
quickly O
corrected O
. O

The O
small O
bar B-AS
is O
always O
packed O
with O
people O
, O
and O
you O
have O
to O
constantly O
contend O
with O
waiters B-AS
asking O
you O
to O
move O
as O
they O
navigate O
through O
the O
crowd O
to O
make O
it O
to O
their O
tables O
. O

Regardless O
of O
the O
amount O
of O
customers O
, O
the O
wait B-AS
for O
food B-AS
is O
insanely O
long O
. O

the O
decor B-AS
isn O
' O
t O
quite O
like O
Shun O
Lee O
but O
the O
service B-AS
will O
definitely O
make O
up O
for O
any O
shortcoming O
. O

And O
there O
wasn O
' O
t O
much O
room O
for O
the O
people O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
to O
stand O
either O
, O
as O
the O
restaurant O
attempted O
to O
squeeze O
as O
many O
tables B-AS
into O
the O
restaurant O
as O
they O
could O
, O
forcing O
those O
dining B-AS
to O
have O
to O
shift O
in O
their O
chairs B-AS
every O
time O
a O
waiter B-AS
attempted O
to O
get O
by O
. O

In O
Short O
It O
' O
s O
a O
bakery O
, O
takeout O
place B-AS
and O
cafe O
all O
in O
one O
, O
and O
thanks O
to O
dishes B-AS
prepared O
using O
the O
same O
ingredients B-AS
stocked O
at O
famed O
gourmet O
food O
emporium O
, O
Zabar O
' O
s O
, O
prices B-AS
and O
quality B-AS
are O
upscale O
. O

But O
it O
' O
s O
the O
ambience B-AS
that O
is O
the O
draw O
for O
me O
- O
- O
- O
sipping O
red B-AS
wine I-AS
and O
sitting O
under O
the O
red O
awning O
on O
a O
warm O
night O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
fine O
, O
out O
appitizers O
took O
forever O
to O
come O
out O
, O
and O
then O
they O
dumped O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
food B-AS
on O
us O
, O
without O
giving O
us O
a O
chance O
to O
enjoy O
our O
appitizers O
. O

The O
servers B-AS
, O
casual O
in O
their O
striped B-AS
button I-AS
- I-AS
downs I-AS
, O
anticipate O
and O
fulfill O
needs O
as O
if O
they O
were O
trained O
as O
mind O
readers O
. O

The O
food B-AS
did O
come O
out O
quickly O
and O
was O
good O
, O
but O
not O
worth O
the O
prices O
or O
the O
wait B-AS
. O

The O
fries B-AS
were O
absolutly O
inedible O
, O
and O
the O
coldslaw O
tasted O
like O
it O
was O
straight O
out O
of O
a O
bucket O
from O
Sam O
' O
s O
, O
and O
the O
friend O
shrimp B-AS
had O
too O
much O
curry B-AS
. O

my O
one O
complaint O
is O
that O
when O
we O
were O
finished O
with O
our O
dinner B-AS
, O
it O
took O
an O
abnormally O
long O
time O
for O
our O
waitress B-AS
to O
get O
with O
the O
program O
and O
bring O
us O
our O
check O
. O

But O
wait B-AS
, O
it O
gets O
even O
better O
, O
the O
mussels B-AS
were O
so O
fishy O
that O
I O
had O
the O
server B-AS
try O
one O
since O
he O
had O
a O
hard O
time O
believing O
that O
this O
was O
true O
. O

This O
place O
happens O
to O
be O
beatifully O
designed O
, O
the O
atmosphere O
is O
relaxed O
( O
as O
opposed O
to O
the O
noisy O
community B-AS
dining I-AS
atmosphere I-AS
in O
so O
many O
busy O
chinese O
reataurants O
- O
which O
can O
also O
be O
OK O
) O
the O
food B-AS
is O
authentic O
Chinese O
as O
opposed O
to O
what O
they O
think O
Americans O
would O
like O
, O
the O
staff B-AS
is O
friendly O
and O
unhurried O
. O

Please O
have O
the O
SPINACH B-AS
DIP I-AS
, O
CAESAR B-AS
SALAD I-AS
, O
HAWAIIAN O
RIB O
- O
EYE O
and O
the O
BROWNIE O
for O
dessert B-AS
. O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
warmly O
dim O
and O
inviting O
- O
if O
you O
make O
a O
reservation B-AS
, O
ask O
for O
a O
corner B-AS
both O
for O
extra O
coziness O
! O

but O
we O
waiting B-AS
two O
hours O
to O
get O
it O
( O
we O
had O
reservations B-AS
but O
it O
was O
late O
so O
we O
wanted O
to O
try O
to O
come O
in O
earlier O
) O
. O

The O
waitress B-AS
at O
the O
bar B-AS
was O
very O
nasty O
to O
me O
because O
she O
mistakenly O
took O
an O
order O
for O
thai O
ice O
tea O
from O
me O
when O
I O
asked O
for O
thai B-AS
lemonade I-AS
in O
a O
to O
- O
go O
cup O
. O

In O
Short O
The O
bi B-AS
- I-AS
level I-AS
dining I-AS
room I-AS
, O
which O
resembles O
a O
bamboo O
- O
thatched O
hut O
, O
is O
a O
brightly O
- O
lit O
, O
wide O
- O
open O
space B-AS
with O
high O
ceilings O
and O
laminated O
depictions O
of O
Indian O
village O
life O
. O

Superfine O
is O
my O
preferred O
destination O
in O
the O
city O
when O
I O
' O
m O
looking O
for O
a O
casual O
, O
hip O
atmosphere B-AS
, O
extraordinary O
food B-AS
at O
decent O
prices B-AS
and O
/ O
or O
just O
a O
place O
to O
get O
a O
good O
drink O
, O
chat O
with O
the O
bartender B-AS
and O
shoot O
some O
( O
free O
) O
pool O
. O

An O
otherwise O
fine O
meal B-AS
was O
trashed O
when O
i O
realized O
that O
the O
dish B-AS
i O
had O
ordered O
contained O
chicked O
, O
despite O
my O
asking O
for O
no O
chicken O
, O
no O
pork O
twice O
. O

The O
Food B-AS
The O
key O
element O
to O
a O
proper O
British O
chip O
is O
fat O
, O
and O
the O
flabby O
, O
pale O
yellow O
specimens B-AS
here O
come O
close O
to O
the O
ideal O
. O

The O
dinner O
menu O
looks O
like O
it O
has O
a O
more O
interesting O
selection O
of O
entrees B-AS
, O
but O
if O
they O
are O
even O
the O
fraction O
of O
the O
quality B-AS
of O
the O
items O
we O
ate O
for O
lunch B-AS
, O
I O
whole O
- O
heartedly O
advise O
you O
to O
make O
it O
a O
point O
and O
dine O
at O
Creama O
- O
- O
if O
not O
for O
the O
drinks O
, O
then O
definitely O
for O
the O
unique O
approach O
to O
mexican B-AS
. O

We O
made O
a O
reservation B-AS
for O
5 O
: O
30pm O
( O
20 O
people O
) O
and O
people O
were O
still O
arriving O
at O
5 O
: O
45 O
( O
over O
half O
the O
group O
was O
there O
) O
when O
the O
manager B-AS
came O
over O
and O
literally O
yelled O
at O
us O
for O
not O
being O
on O
time O
saying O
it O
was O
a O
busy O
time O
for O
him O
, O
when O
in O
fact O
there O
were O
several O
empty O
tables B-AS
throughout O
the O
restaurant O
. O

When O
I O
went O
for O
sunday O
brunch B-AS
, O
not O
only O
was O
the O
food B-AS
bland O
and O
cold O
, O
they O
didn O
' O
t O
even O
bother O
to O
clear O
the O
plates B-AS
once O
they O
brought O
the O
bill B-AS
. O

The O
Wasa B-AS
Waffle O
was O
different O
but O
when O
we O
spoke O
to O
the O
manager B-AS
he O
inmediatly O
changed O
if O
for O
another O
dish B-AS
( O
He O
suggested O
the O
Chocolate O
decadence O
French O
Toast O
. O

The O
pizza B-AS
is O
thet O
always O
fresh O
and O
just O
made O
they O
hav O
an O
outdoor B-AS
seating I-AS
area I-AS
that O
is O
partially O
covered O
they O
also O
have O
a O
full O
service B-AS
restaurant O
on O
the O
premises O
they O
make O
everything O
on O
premises O
. O

Consistently O
satisfying O
versions O
of O
Thai B-AS
staples I-AS
like O
pad B-AS
Thai I-AS
and I-AS
curry I-AS
dishes I-AS
arrive O
in O
generous O
portions B-AS
. O

I O
naively O
thought O
dinner B-AS
was O
served B-AS
during O
the O
show O
, O
but O
the O
waiters B-AS
don O
' O
t O
come O
by O
once O
the O
shows O
start O
, O
so O
order O
your O
wine B-AS
30 O
mins O
before O
the O
show O
start O
time O
. O

The O
menu B-AS
is O
limited O
so O
I O
opted O
for O
the O
jalapeno O
potato O
soup O
and O
a O
romaine B-AS
salad I-AS
. O

Other O
guests O
enjoyed O
pizza B-AS
, O
santa B-AS
fe I-AS
chopped I-AS
salad I-AS
and O
fish B-AS
and I-AS
chips I-AS
. O

The O
items O
available O
during O
dimsum B-AS
time O
were O
plentiful O
- O
the O
turnip B-AS
cake I-AS
was O
excellent O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
going O
at O
off O
- O
times O
( O
before O
7 O
perhaps O
) O
to O
avoid O
the O
crowds B-AS
as O
it O
gets O
packed O
and O
there O
isn O
' O
t O
much O
room O
by O
the O
bar B-AS
. O

I O
mean O
no O
disrespect O
to O
the O
owner O
, O
just O
constructive O
criticism O
- O
improve O
the O
decor B-AS
and O
dine O
- O
in O
service O
, O
but O
DON O
' O
T O
change O
the O
portions B-AS
or O
the O
recipes B-AS
. O

At O
no O
point O
during O
our O
dinner B-AS
were O
we O
left O
alone O
to O
simply O
enjoy O
our O
food B-AS
. O

Waitress B-AS
didn O
' O
t O
know O
anything O
about O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
but O
other O
than O
that O
I O
would O
recommend O
. O

With O
tacky O
kitsch O
as O
the O
decor B-AS
' O
s O
dominant O
motif O
and O
the O
obligatory B-AS
grousing O
waiters B-AS
hustling O
out O
brick O
- O
sized O
steaks O
and O
icy O
vodka B-AS
to O
gussied O
- O
up O
regulars O
and O
tourists O
, O
an O
evening O
at O
Sammy O
' O
s O
is O
both O
dinner B-AS
and O
street O
theater O
. O

Handsome O
baritone O
Nordic O
waiters B-AS
patrol O
the O
room O
, O
proffering O
fresh O
- O
squeezed O
juices O
and O
$ O
4 O
- O
a O
- O
person O
pots O
of O
French O
press B-AS
coffee I-AS
. O

Although O
it O
was O
quite O
good O
, O
the O
small O
portions B-AS
at O
this O
table O
of O
4 O
, O
including O
appetizers B-AS
, O
did O
not O
constitute O
adequate O
sustenance O
. O

The O
green B-AS
hair I-AS
table I-AS
and O
seating B-AS
at O
the O
front B-AS
window I-AS
was O
tacky O
and O
gimmicky O
, O
but O
figured O
it O
' O
s O
the O
food B-AS
that O
counts O
. O

The O
food O
was O
average O
: O
the O
almond B-AS
crusted I-AS
halibut I-AS
was O
bland O
, O
while O
the O
sashimi B-AS
appetizer I-AS
was O
excellent O
. O

First O
, O
the O
hostess B-AS
gave O
us O
a O
nasty O
look O
when O
asked O
if O
we O
could O
eat O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
, O
and O
then O
just O
swished O
her O
hand O
to O
indicate O
we O
could O
seat O
ourselves O
. O

Despite O
him O
not O
being O
my O
designated O
server B-AS
, O
he O
basically O
took O
over O
for O
our O
inexperienced O
waiter B-AS
the O
rest O
of O
the O
dinner B-AS
. O

After O
requesting O
to O
be O
seated O
at O
an O
empty O
table O
, O
the O
waitress B-AS
( O
who O
was O
so O
terribly O
burdened O
when O
we O
asked O
to O
move O
from O
the O
bar B-AS
to O
the O
table O
to O
have O
dinner B-AS
) O
asked O
us O
to O
get O
up O
from O
our O
seats O
and O
wait O
for O
a O
smaller O
table O
because O
a O
party O
of O
3 O
just O
walked O
in O
. O

Sat O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
and O
orderd O
a O
few O
appetizers O
, O
the O
humus B-AS
and I-AS
cheese I-AS
plates I-AS
along O
with O
some O
calamari B-AS
- O
all O
very O
tasty O
. O

the O
hostess O
is O
rude O
as O
can O
be O
, O
the O
waiters O
can O
' O
t O
stop O
to O
check O
in O
, O
the O
busboys B-AS
are O
flinging O
stuff O
on O
your O
table B-AS
, O
and O
that O
' O
s O
true O
even O
when O
the O
restaurant O
is O
half O
empty O
! O

Call O
it O
a O
bar B-AS
with O
weak O
but O
tasty O
sangria B-AS
and O
leave O
it O
at O
that O
. O

For O
$ O
65 O
, O
you O
will O
get O
a O
5 O
- O
6 O
course O
tasting O
menu B-AS
encompassing O
a O
variety O
of O
raw B-AS
fish I-AS
, O
cooked O
fish O
, O
pastas B-AS
, O
dessert B-AS
, O
etc O
. O

Never O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
or O
in O
my O
inquiry O
to O
the O
waitress B-AS
was O
the O
word O
garlic O
mentioned O
. O

i O
was O
at O
opia O
january O
5 O
, O
2006 O
we O
had O
some O
drinks B-AS
, O
dinner B-AS
, O
i O
have O
to O
say O
that O
we O
had O
me O
and O
my O
friend O
great O
time O
, O
the O
staff B-AS
was O
listening O
, O
the O
manager B-AS
knew O
what O
he O
was O
doing O
and O
the O
food O
better O
than O
ever O
! O
! O

It O
wasn O
' O
t O
until O
we O
spoke O
with O
management B-AS
that O
we O
were O
able O
to O
finish O
our O
meal B-AS
and O
get O
out O
of O
the O
restaurant O
, O
but O
already O
one O
of O
our O
party O
had O
to O
leave O
early O
and O
the O
rest O
of O
us O
were O
late O
for O
our O
afternoon O
engagements B-AS
. O

It O
is O
a O
must O
for O
lunch B-AS
, O
dinner B-AS
or O
anytime O
you O
have O
a O
big O
appetite O
and O
don O
' O
t O
want O
to O
spend O
big O
bucks O
in O
the O
big O
Apple B-AS
! O

What O
it O
lacks O
in O
decor B-AS
it O
more O
than O
makes O
up O
in O
the O
cuisine B-AS
. O

Went O
for O
lunch B-AS
the O
bartenders B-AS
were O
great O
, O
also O
they O
had O
a O
DJ B-AS
playing O
music O
during O
the O
day O
, O
there O
was O
a O
Huge O
screen O
tv O
playing O
music O
videos O
and O
a O
bunch O
of O
other O
tvs O
with O
all O
the O
sports O
you O
could O
look O
at O
. O

The O
waitress B-AS
encouraged O
to O
come O
for O
dinner B-AS
and O
brunch B-AS
, O
and O
I O
followed O
her O
recommandation O
. O

Our O
waiter B-AS
was O
very O
prompt O
and O
friendly O
, O
but O
the O
worst O
part O
of O
the O
experience O
was O
actually O
after O
the O
meal B-AS
when O
I O
was O
leaving O
. O

Me O
and O
my O
wife O
we O
go O
there O
at O
least O
once O
a O
month O
, O
the O
food B-AS
they O
give O
you O
is O
amazing O
we O
only O
get O
one O
order O
of O
pasta B-AS
and O
main B-AS
course I-AS
it O
is O
enough O
for O
both O
to O
share O
, O
we O
get O
full O
and O
satisfied O
, O
our O
favorite O
dish B-AS
penne O
with O
pesto B-AS
. O

The O
service B-AS
has O
always O
been O
outstanding O
and O
even O
when O
we O
didn O
' O
t O
have O
a O
reservation B-AS
they O
worked O
something O
out O
, O
where O
I O
agreed O
to O
keep O
our O
meal B-AS
to O
just O
eating O
. O

the O
hostess O
wasn O
' O
t O
sure O
until O
3 O
hours O
later O
10 O
: O
28 O
: O
Here O
we O
go O
Eggplant O
parmigiana O
fried O
grease O
an O
heavy O
duty O
Pollo O
dish B-AS
covered O
with O
1 O
/ O
4 O
of O
a O
pound O
of O
mozzarella B-AS
. O

Once O
we O
ordered O
, O
it O
took O
at O
least O
30 O
minutes O
to O
get O
our O
food B-AS
, O
with O
our O
server B-AS
no O
where O
in O
site O
. O

Thanks O
to O
waiter B-AS
I O
learned O
so O
much O
about O
wine B-AS
too O
. O

Down O
right O
comfortable O
, O
pleasant O
, O
enormous O
portions B-AS
, O
have O
lunch B-AS
and O
bring O
home O
a O
doggie O
bag O
wth O
your O
dinner B-AS
. O

A O
couple O
of O
hints O
: O
1 O
) O
avoid O
going O
during O
peak O
lunch B-AS
and O
dinner B-AS
hours O
- O
everything O
is O
made O
fresh O
so O
it O
takes O
time O
, O
2 O
) O
definitely O
try O
their O
Concrete O
desert O
- O
my O
favorite O
is O
chocolate B-AS
with O
bananas B-AS
and O
hot O
fudge O
mixed O
in O
. O

We O
felt O
the O
waiter B-AS
and O
captain B-AS
rushed O
us O
through O
our O
meal B-AS
. O

The O
desserts B-AS
are O
just O
as O
good O
as O
all O
the O
coffee B-AS
shops O
around O
town O
but O
they O
charge O
more O
than O
anyone O
. O

You O
might O
be O
lucky O
enough O
to O
hear O
your O
waiter B-AS
say O
, O
May O
I O
take O
zee O
order O
from O
you O
, O
Pig B-AS
Dog I-AS
, O
while O
you O
' O
re O
there O
. O

Recommended O
to O
those O
who O
want O
to O
try O
a O
different O
setting B-AS
for O
a O
diner B-AS
. O

Definitely O
one O
of O
the O
Slope O
' O
s O
best O
bets O
for O
Chinese B-AS
food I-AS
- O
- O
or O
for O
vegetarians O
( O
there O
' O
s O
an O
extensive O
veggy O
menu B-AS
, O
as O
well O
as O
many O
meat B-AS
dishes I-AS
) O
. O

In O
the O
main B-AS
dining I-AS
room I-AS
, O
finding O
your O
waiter B-AS
is O
Hell O
and O
aside O
from O
when O
they O
take O
your O
order O
and O
bring O
the O
bill O
, O
you O
' O
ll O
rarely O
see O
them O
. O

We O
had O
a O
five B-AS
- I-AS
course I-AS
dinner I-AS
and O
none O
of O
the O
dishes B-AS
really O
impressed O
except O
maybe O
the O
signature B-AS
oysters I-AS
and O
pearls O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
pretty O
good O
, O
but O
the O
staff B-AS
would O
rather O
be O
anywhere O
than O
waiting B-AS
tables I-AS
at O
Maison O
. O

I O
went O
there O
for O
lunch B-AS
on O
a O
quiet O
weekday B-AS
afternoon O
and O
everything O
my O
friend O
and O
I O
ordered O
was O
immaculately O
presented O
and O
absolutely O
delicious O
- O
- O
I O
had O
moules B-AS
frites I-AS
and O
she O
had O
the O
salmon B-AS
burger I-AS
. O

the O
food B-AS
is O
not O
nearly O
good O
enough O
to O
wait O
an O
hour O
before O
seeing O
your O
server B-AS
, O
or O
wait O
another O
hour O
for O
the O
wrong O
entrees B-AS
, O
or O
for O
the O
manager B-AS
to O
make O
up O
for O
it O
by O
charging O
for O
everthing O
but O
giving O
us O
on O
the O
house O
shot O
glasses O
of O
watery O
margaritas O
. O

And O
although O
I O
' O
ve O
noticed O
that O
the O
prices B-AS
have O
gone O
up O
a O
little O
since O
they O
opened O
, O
it O
' O
s O
still O
a O
great O
menu B-AS
. O

For O
dinner B-AS
I O
recommend O
Carne O
Tampiquea O
( O
steak O
) O
And O
for O
brunch B-AS
the O
Huaraches O
with O
meat O
and O
a O
couple O
eggs B-AS
on O
top O
, O
a O
typical O
mexican O
hangover O
plate O
! O

Even O
with O
reservation B-AS
, O
it O
might O
take O
up O
to O
one O
hour O
to O
get O
a O
table O
and O
the O
staff B-AS
might O
not O
even O
say O
a O
word O
about O
it O
. O

The O
food O
is O
above O
average O
, O
though O
the O
portions B-AS
a O
tad O
small O
, O
even O
for O
tapas O
; O
but O
they O
more O
than O
make O
up O
for O
it O
with O
their O
wonderfull O
mojitos B-AS
. O

as O
for O
the O
people O
whom O
posted O
about O
the O
salad B-AS
, O
I O
never O
had O
it O
, O
as O
for O
the O
person O
that O
had O
no O
sides O
with O
the O
steak B-AS
, O
they O
must O
have O
made O
a O
mistake O
, O
everytime O
I O
go O
its O
come O
' O
s O
with O
awesome O
potatoes B-AS
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
adequate O
though O
we O
did O
need O
to O
keep O
asking O
for O
water O
and O
the O
drinks B-AS
from O
the O
bar B-AS
took O
a O
long O
time O
- O
plus O
the O
restaraurant O
was O
not O
crowded O
. O

The O
arrogant O
maitre B-AS
' O
d O
was O
annoyed O
when O
i O
asked O
about O
sitting O
down O
those O
tables O
are O
for O
other O
reservations B-AS
low O
and O
behold O
those O
tables O
were O
still O
open O
as O
my O
wife O
and O
I O
finished O
dinner B-AS
. O

I O
have O
been O
here O
a O
few O
times O
and O
never O
had O
a O
boring O
meal B-AS
! O
Food B-AS
always O
fresh O
, O
service B-AS
very O
civilized O
. O

Over O
a O
period O
of O
time O
some O
restaurants O
tend O
to O
loose O
the O
quality B-AS
of O
the O
taste B-AS
of O
their O
food B-AS
, O
but O
not O
Ray O
' O
s O
. O

The O
manager B-AS
very O
politely O
told O
the O
drunk O
man O
that O
he O
could O
leave O
and O
then O
gave O
everyone O
on O
the O
resturaunt O
a O
free O
glass B-AS
of O
port O
for O
having O
to O
witness O
it O
. O

Save O
the O
$ O
$ O
and O
go O
to O
to O
curry O
hill O
( O
just O
2 O
- O
3 O
blocks O
away O
) O
or O
spend O
the O
$ O
$ O
at O
a O
midtown O
indian O
eatery O
( O
Also O
: O
I O
commented O
to O
hostess B-AS
prior O
to O
seating B-AS
that O
there O
were O
a O
lot O
of O
tables B-AS
empty O
when O
choosing O
my O
seat O
, O
and O
she O
snapped O
back O
that O
they O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
reservations B-AS
coming O
in O
at O
one O
time O
. O

An O
unfriendly O
hostess B-AS
greeted O
us O
and O
placed O
us O
in O
the O
main O
room O
of O
the O
restaurant O
where O
the O
tables B-AS
were O
so O
close O
together O
that O
it O
was O
impossible O
for O
guests O
and O
waiter B-AS
to O
move O
without O
bumping O
you O
. O

All O
in O
all O
the O
food B-AS
was O
above O
average O
and O
I O
would O
return O
to O
see O
how O
they O
operate O
with O
four O
or O
less O
dinners B-AS
. O

It O
took O
forever O
to O
seat B-AS
us O
even O
though O
the O
restaurant O
was O
almost O
completely O
empty O
, O
then O
we O
had O
to O
ask O
to O
be O
waited O
on O
, O
it O
took O
another O
15 O
minutes O
to O
get O
our O
drinks B-AS
, O
and O
then O
another O
30 O
minutes O
to O
get O
our O
salad O
and O
then O
even O
more O
time O
to O
get O
our O
pizza O
and O
then O
our O
bill O
. O

The O
Scene B-AS
At O
this O
sleek O
spot O
on O
a O
relatively O
sparse O
stretch O
of O
Spring O
Street O
, O
regulars O
belly O
up O
to O
a O
small O
bar B-AS
and O
greet O
owner B-AS
Giorgio O
DeLuca O
, O
of O
Dean O
and O
DeLuca O
fame O
, O
with O
warm O
hugs B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
seems O
so O
- O
so O
, O
although O
the O
nachos O
were O
really O
yummy O
( O
fake O
hot O
cheese O
w O
/ O
big O
cups O
of O
beans B-AS
, O
chili B-AS
guac I-AS
on O
the O
side O
) O
. O

both O
appetizer O
and O
main B-AS
were O
poorly O
made O
by O
some O
random O
cooks B-AS
the O
picked O
up O
from O
who O
knows O
where O
. O

But O
a O
server B-AS
coming O
up O
to O
the O
table O
chewing O
gum O
while O
she O
went O
through O
the O
specials B-AS
is O
not O
my O
idea O
of O
professional O
. O

Called O
to O
complain O
and O
the O
response B-AS
was O
well O
, O
we O
didn O
' O
t O
charge O
you O
for O
the O
falafel B-AS
sandwich I-AS
we O
shorted O
you O
. O

We O
had O
to O
wait O
by O
the O
door B-AS
, O
and O
the O
host B-AS
failed O
to O
acknowledge O
our O
existence O
for O
a O
whole O
15 O
minutes O
! O

They O
kept O
us O
waiting B-AS
for O
more O
than O
an O
hour O
WITH O
a O
reservation B-AS
and O
WITHOUT O
an O
apology O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
incredibly O
tasting O
and O
, O
if O
you O
want O
an O
advice O
: O
Grill B-AS
calamari I-AS
, O
Rigatoni B-AS
a O
la O
vodka O
and O
, O
for O
dessert B-AS
, O
Tartufata O
. O

The O
' O
people O
watching O
' O
and O
table B-AS
location I-AS
( O
on O
boardwalk O
) O
made O
up O
for O
the O
rude O
service B-AS
. O

I O
liked O
the O
hummos B-AS
platter I-AS
, O
the O
brie B-AS
sandwich I-AS
, O
and O
about O
20 O
other O
things O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
( O
if O
they O
still O
have O
the O
chocolate B-AS
cake I-AS
you O
need O
to O
get O
it O
) O
. O

Only O
drawback O
is O
the O
sound O
level O
- O
quite O
a O
loud O
space B-AS
downstairs I-AS
- O
and O
that O
might O
be O
accounted O
for O
with O
their O
trendy O
bar B-AS
and O
right O
off O
Times O
Square O
. O

We O
are O
a O
huge O
fan O
of O
their O
brunch B-AS
- O
specifically O
the O
blt O
with O
a O
fried B-AS
egg I-AS
and I-AS
avocado I-AS
and O
their O
asparagus B-AS
omelette I-AS
with I-AS
truffle I-AS
oil I-AS
. O

For O
dinner B-AS
we O
decided O
to O
share O
on O
the O
Veal B-AS
Cordon I-AS
Blue I-AS
( O
wow O
) O
and O
the O
Artic O
char O
, O
a O
nice O
dish B-AS
. O

Sashimi B-AS
was O
ok O
( O
maki O
rolls B-AS
tasted O
better O
) O
. O

Worth O
the O
trip O
over O
the O
bridge O
, O
worth O
the O
search O
for O
parking O
, O
worth O
the O
wait O
for O
a O
table B-AS
at O
dinner B-AS
time O
and O
worthy O
of O
a O
ten O
rating O
. O

We O
were O
told O
by O
the O
hostess B-AS
to O
make O
sure O
we O
were O
on O
time O
for O
our O
reservation B-AS
, O
which O
we O
were O
, O
but O
then O
they O
kept O
us O
waiting B-AS
for O
15 O
minutes O
when O
we O
got O
there O
. O

While O
the O
deocr O
in O
the O
dining B-AS
room I-AS
is O
less O
than O
inviting O
, O
I O
recommend O
eating O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
where O
there O
is O
full O
menu O
service O
. O

Relaxed O
neighborhooders O
treat O
the O
spot B-AS
like O
a O
second O
home O
, O
calling O
the O
staff B-AS
by O
name O
and O
lingering O
despite O
the O
smallish O
bar B-AS
and O
hurried O
courses O
. O

The O
Scene B-AS
Schnack O
feels O
a O
lot O
like O
a O
roller O
- O
rink O
concession O
stand O
circa O
1982 O
, O
from O
the O
deep O
vinyl O
booths O
and O
beat O
- O
up O
chairs O
right O
down O
to O
the O
loud O
music O
and O
plastic O
menu B-AS
boards I-AS
. O

The O
restaurant O
is O
attractively O
decorated O
but O
totally O
lacks O
an O
atmosphere B-AS
partly O
because O
of O
the O
extra O
bright O
lighting B-AS
. O

Same O
quality O
for O
1 O
/ O
3 O
the O
price B-AS
and O
a O
realistic O
atmosphere B-AS
. O

Also O
available O
is O
eggplant B-AS
in I-AS
garlic I-AS
sauce I-AS
, O
the O
Zen B-AS
vegi I-AS
- I-AS
burger I-AS
, O
with O
sunflower O
seeds O
, O
kale O
and O
brown O
rice O
, O
and O
curry O
- O
rice O
- O
noodle O
soup B-AS
. O

Then O
, O
the O
waitress B-AS
gave O
my O
wife O
coffee O
with O
regular O
milk O
in O
it O
even O
though O
my O
wife O
specifically O
requested O
Soy B-AS
Milk I-AS
. O

I O
will O
definitely O
try O
dinner B-AS
, O
but O
they O
do O
need O
to O
fix O
the O
kitchen B-AS
shifts O
so O
that O
people O
get O
served O
in O
a O
reasonable O
time O
. O

One O
of O
the O
managers B-AS
offered O
us O
a O
seat B-AS
at O
the O
bar B-AS
to O
wait B-AS
for O
a O
table O
, O
there O
we O
had O
the O
most O
amazing O
empanadas B-AS
and O
red O
sangria B-AS
. O

You O
fry O
it O
in O
your O
batter B-AS
and O
roll O
it O
up O
in O
spices B-AS
, O
big O
chunky B-AS
blue I-AS
cheese I-AS
makes O
them O
taste O
so O
nice O
' O
s O
. O

We O
are O
laidback O
diners B-AS
and O
as O
we O
' O
ve O
both O
waited O
tables B-AS
, O
we O
tend O
to O
be O
forgiving O
of O
irregular O
service B-AS
. O

I O
have O
no O
idea O
what O
the O
food B-AS
is O
like O
here O
, O
I O
only O
come O
for O
the O
frozen B-AS
margaritas I-AS
which O
I O
find O
to O
be O
the O
best O
I O
' O
ve O
found O
in O
the O
city O
and O
the O
grilled B-AS
corn I-AS
. O

it O
took O
forever O
for O
the O
waiter B-AS
to O
take O
my O
order O
as O
he O
was O
too O
busy O
chatting O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
. O

The O
waitress B-AS
apologized O
for O
the O
long O
wait O
and O
said O
they O
would O
give O
us O
some O
free O
drinks B-AS
or O
desert O
since O
they O
forgot O
about O
our O
orders O
but O
we O
never O
received O
anything O
and O
by O
the O
time O
we O
got O
the O
bill O
we O
just O
wanted O
to O
pay O
and O
leave O
. O

The O
price B-AS
is O
well O
worth O
the O
quality B-AS
and O
quantity B-AS
of O
food B-AS
. O

My O
friend O
and O
I O
walked O
in O
to O
an O
over O
crowded O
bar B-AS
and O
were O
warned O
of O
a O
45 O
minute O
wait B-AS
. O

Count O
on O
fresh O
, O
fairly O
priced O
cuts O
of O
fish B-AS
that O
represent O
a O
good O
value O
, O
even O
if O
portions B-AS
are O
a O
bit O
on O
the O
small O
side O
. O

Even O
with O
our O
reservation B-AS
, O
they O
had O
us O
waiting B-AS
at O
the O
bar B-AS
for O
over O
an O
hour O
. O

Most O
diners O
stick O
to O
hot O
( O
shredded B-AS
chicken I-AS
breast I-AS
in I-AS
garlic I-AS
and O
walnut O
sauce O
) O
and O

olives I-AS
, O
capers O
and O
anchovies O
) O
meze O
, O
served O
in O
handsome O
vintage O
dishes B-AS
. O

Seated O
just O
after O
2 O
; O
I O
commend O
them O
' O
cause O
they O
were O
the O
only O
decent O
brunch B-AS
spot I-AS
that O
would O
take O
our O
reservation B-AS
, O
and O
they O
did O
their O
best O
to O
seat O
us O
promptly O
. O

After O
the O
grilled O
calamari O
, O
we O
got O
onion B-AS
soup I-AS
that O
had O
no O
soup O
, O
a O
dish O
of O
beans B-AS
that O
had O
no O
flavor B-AS
, O
the O
kitchen O
didn O
' O
t O
make O
one O
of O
the O
three O
pasta O
dishes O
ordered O
, O
and O
the O
pork B-AS
chop I-AS
and O
other O
main O
dishes O
were O
not O
very O
good O
. O

The O
servers O
were O
prompt O
and O
attentive O
, O
but O
the O
food B-AS
arrived O
lukewarm O
( O
maybe O
it O
was O
served B-AS
so O
quickly O
because O
it O
was O
pre O
- O
cooked O
and O
had O
been O
sitting O
out O
for O
a O
while O
) O
and O
was O
not O
all O
that O
flavorful O
. O

Like O
the O
other O
Bromberg O
Brothers O
establishments O
, O
expect O
the O
customer B-AS
is O
always O
wrong O
attitude O
from O
the O
staff B-AS
along O
with O
overpriced O
wines B-AS
you O
never O
heard O
of O
, O
no O
bar B-AS
, O
tiny O
waiting B-AS
area I-AS
and O
lousy O
desserts B-AS
. O

My O
friend O
also O
knew O
the O
chef O
, O
so O
we O
had O
some O
other O
courses O
not O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
but O
even O
knowing O
the O
chef O
didn O
' O
t O
get O
us O
the O
service B-AS
I O
would O
expect O
at O
this O
type O
of O
restaurant O
. O

First O
, O
the O
seating B-AS
people I-AS
gave O
me O
huge O
attitude O
and O
claimed O
I O
had O
not O
reserved O
a O
table O
at O
the O
grotto O
- O
and O
I O
quote O
my O
reservation B-AS
You O
are O
all O
set O
for O
the O
grotta O
this O
saturday O
. O

Getting O
into O
the O
steak B-AS
frites I-AS
takes O
some O
sawing O
, O
but O
once O
cut O
, O
the O
meat B-AS
is O
flavorful O
, O
if O
in O
need O
of O
salt O
. O

I O
liked O
the O
place B-AS
and O
the O
people B-AS
, O
but O
we O
really O
went O
to O
have O
dinner O
no O
appetizers B-AS
as O
the O
whole O
dinner O
. O

and O
if O
that O
wasn O
' O
t O
enough O
the O
owner B-AS
threw O
in O
a O
free O
beer B-AS
each O
for O
me O
and O
my O
friend O
. O

Other O
small O
dishes B-AS
, O
such O
as O
the O
fragrant B-AS
sesame I-AS
oil I-AS
- I-AS
scented I-AS
raw I-AS
spicy I-AS
tuna I-AS
, O
are O
excellent O
with O
a O
beer O
- O
sized O
mug O
of O
cold O
oolong O
tea B-AS
. O

True O
, O
the O
ambiance B-AS
is O
something O
out O
of O
Goodfellas O
, O
but O
it O
the O
food B-AS
and O
waiters B-AS
are O
out O
of O
this O
world O
! O

I O
was O
impressed O
with O
every O
dish B-AS
and O
was O
tempted O
to O
go O
back O
for O
dinner B-AS
that O
night O
! O

junk O
food B-AS
place I-AS
that O
could O
do O
well O
with O
a O
good O
cleaning B-AS
. O

There O
' O
s O
even O
a O
nice O
menu O
of O
savory B-AS
items I-AS
served I-AS
during O
late O
lunch O
and O
dinner B-AS
hours I-AS
. O

The O
numbness O
in O
your O
lower O
legs O
from O
sitting O
on O
old O
wood B-AS
chairs I-AS
is O
more O
than O
compensated O
by O
the O
wonderful O
food B-AS
. O

They O
kept O
the O
chef O
, O
margarita O
machines O
, O
and O
practically O
the O
identical O
menu B-AS
from O
Miracle O
Grill B-AS
( O
the O
restaurant O
that O
formerly O
had O
the O
space B-AS
) O
; O
how O
is O
it O
that O
everything O
here O
is O
so O
much O
worse O
? O

I O
like O
to O
drink B-AS
a O
variety O
of O
teas O
, O
but O
I O
' O
ve O
had O
some O
here O
that O
are O
really O
weird O
that O
I O
would O
avoid O
next O
time B-AS
. O

The O
organic B-AS
free I-AS
range I-AS
chicken I-AS
was O
a O
6 O
, O
the O
lamb B-AS
chop I-AS
was O
excellent O
, O
and O
we O
had O
to O
send O
the O
halibut O
back O
2x O
with O
no O
result O
- O
ended O
up O
having O
to O
order O
anther O
dish B-AS
( O
cod O
) O
in O
which O
the O
fish B-AS
was O
good O
but O
the O
clams O
were O
too O
tough O
to O
eat O
and O
the O
sausage B-AS
wasn O
' O
t O
even O
finished O
cooking O
( O
thus O
could O
not O
be O
consumed O
) O
. O

The O
drinks B-AS
are O
very O
pricey O
and O
small O
, O
and O
the O
food O
is O
ok O
- O
but O
the O
portion B-AS
size I-AS
for O
the O
price O
is O
outrageous O
. O

My O
date O
and O
I O
were O
both O
taken O
back O
by O
the O
lack O
of O
the O
friendly O
attitude B-AS
from O
the O
owner B-AS
of O
the O
restaurant O
. O

First O
, O
the O
waiter B-AS
brought O
us O
to O
a O
table O
where O
people O
were O
still O
finishing O
their O
coffee O
from O
their O
meal B-AS
- O
he O
told O
them O
the O
restaurant O
was O
busy O
and O
they O
needed O
to O
finish O
now O
and O
to O
pay O
their O
bill O
inside O
. O

Our O
lovely O
waiter B-AS
sent O
us O
off O
with O
scones O
for O
breakfast B-AS
the O
following O
AM O
! O

For O
entree B-AS
I O
would O
recommand O
the O
rabbit B-AS
curry I-AS
- O
the O
meat B-AS
was O
cooked O
very O
finely O
and O
the O
curry B-AS
sauce I-AS
, O
though O
a O
bit O
too O
sweet O
, O
went O
well O
with O
rice O
. O

After O
a O
crazy O
day O
@ O
work O
, O
with O
no O
reservation B-AS
, O
we O
were O
so O
lucky O
to O
score O
a O
seat B-AS
at O
the O
bar B-AS
on O
an O
incredibly O
busy O
evening B-AS
. O

Besides O
, O
vegetarian O
or O
not O
, O
there O
are O
always O
ways O
to O
liven O
up O
food B-AS
without O
compromising O
the O
healthy O
aspect B-AS
. O

I O
read O
about O
this O
place O
in O
the O
Post O
, O
but O
never O
stepped O
foot O
in O
it O
I O
ordered O
a O
red B-AS
velvet I-AS
cake I-AS
to O
be O
delivered O
to O
lOwer O
Manhattan O
; O
It O
got O
there O
, O
and O
the O
broads B-AS
at O
the O
office O
raved O
about O
it O
! O

If O
you O
are O
undecided O
about O
which O
sandwich O
to O
choose O
, O
go O
for O
the O
Indecision B-AS
, O
which O
is O
a O
trio O
of O
smaller O
sandwiches B-AS
on O
the O
menu B-AS
. O

If O
you O
had O
good O
service B-AS
there O
, O
try O
to O
get O
your O
waiter B-AS
' O
s O
name O
and O
request O
him O
/ O
her O
by O
name O
the O
next O
time O
. O

I O
prefer O
to O
sit O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
as O
I O
don O
' O
t O
have O
to O
listen O
to O
loud O
, O
boring O
conversations O
from O
the O
next B-AS
table I-AS
who O
always O
seem O
to O
be O
friends O
of O
the O
owner B-AS
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
spent O
a O
long O
time O
telling O
us O
about O
the O
menu B-AS
( O
and O
more O
about O
his O
own O
life O
history O
in O
the O
process O
. O

We O
had O
a O
nice O
bottle B-AS
of I-AS
wine I-AS
, O
dinner B-AS
, O
and O
dessert B-AS
for O
under O
$ O
200 O
. O

Everything O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
is O
satisfyingly O
savory O
, O
from O
a O
simple O
pot B-AS
of O
mussels B-AS
in O
a O
choice O
of O
sauces O
( O
beer O
- O
and O
- O
bacon O
, O
creamy O
mushroom O
, O
or O
white B-AS
- I-AS
wine I-AS
- I-AS
and I-AS
- I-AS
garlic I-AS
broth I-AS
) O
, O
to O
beef B-AS
stewed I-AS
with O
beer O
and O
prunes O
, O
to O
a O
juicy O
croque O
- O
monsieur O
, O
and O
beyond O
. O

The O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
didn O
' O
t O
bother O
to O
refill O
my O
water B-AS
until O
I O
had O
finish O
mine O
and O
was O
almost O
done O
with O
my O
husband O
' O
s O
glass O
too O
. O

Yes O
, O
this O
place B-AS
is O
good O
, O
a O
cut O
above O
some O
of O
the O
other O
local O
diner B-AS
food I-AS
and O
a O
nice O
, O
friendly O
atmosphere B-AS
. O

since O
we O
' O
re O
informed O
its O
service B-AS
isslow O
we O
had O
dinner B-AS
in O
midtownwent O
for O
dessertb O
- O
day O
thing O
. O

It O
' O
s O
one O
of O
our O
take B-AS
- I-AS
out I-AS
staples I-AS
because O
of O
the O
good O
food B-AS
, O
fast O
delivery B-AS
time O
and O
the O
cheap O
price B-AS
( O
for O
under O
$ O
25 O
we O
have O
a O
dinner B-AS
for O
2 O
and O
with O
left O
- O
overs O
) O
. O

Too O
late O
to O
get O
a O
reservation B-AS
so O
we O
went O
upstairs O
where O
initially O
the O
crowded O
scene B-AS
threw O
me O
for O
a O
loop O
. O

The O
Scene B-AS
Chief O
among O
the O
neighborhood O
' O
s O
bustling O
cafes O
is O
Kolonaki O
, O
with O
its O
inviting O
upstairs B-AS
space I-AS
, O
replete O
with O
rich O
, O
dark O
wood B-AS
tables I-AS
and O
windowsills O
. O

The O
texture B-AS
of O
their O
flat B-AS
noodles I-AS
is O
something O
that O
has O
to O
be O
experienced O
to O
understand O
. O

Although O
, O
we O
were O
seated O
within O
an O
hour O
, O
the O
bartender O
and O
waiter O
were O
very O
nice O
and O
the O
food B-AS
was O
good O
( O
although O
my O
pork B-AS
was O
too O
salty O
) O
we O
would O
not O
return O
. O

The O
only O
blemish O
was O
our O
waitress B-AS
, O
who O
left O
us O
with O
empty O
drinks B-AS
for O
quite O
a O
long O
time O
. O

We O
( O
naturally O
) O
asked O
for O
a O
discount B-AS
when O
the O
bill O
came O
, O
and O
our O
waitress B-AS
disappeared O
for O
a O
moment O
and O
offered O
us O
. O

When O
the O
bill O
finally O
arrived O
, O
the O
head O
waiter B-AS
sternly O
told O
us O
that O
this O
time O
is O
okay O
, O
but O
next O
time O
you O
have O
to O
order O
more O
than O
2 O
appitizers B-AS
and O
a O
main O
course O
! O

the O
menu B-AS
looked O
great O
, O
but O
the O
food B-AS
was O
the O
biggest O
disappointment O
i O
' O
ve O
had O
yet O
! O

We O
waited O
in O
standing O
at O
the O
entrance O
for O
5 O
mins O
to O
get O
seats O
due O
to O
just O
slow O
service B-AS
, O
another O
10mins O
to O
get O
menu B-AS
, O
and O
then O
another O
10mins O
to O
get O
water O
bread B-AS
. O

The O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
is O
very O
attentive O
, O
and O
you O
can O
smoke O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
while O
enjoying O
the O
view O
of O
the O
river O
. O

I O
complained O
to O
the O
manager B-AS
who O
offered O
to O
move O
us O
and O
pay O
for O
our O
appetizers B-AS
. O

We O
were O
not O
seated O
by O
a O
hostess B-AS
( O
and O
as O
a O
result O
didn O
' O
t O
receive O
menus B-AS
or O
water O
for O
a O
good O
while O
) O
and O
were O
rushed O
out O
as O
the O
restaurant O
closed O
an O
hour O
after O
we O
arrived O
. O

When O
I O
requested O
a O
change O
to O
the O
non O
- O
smoking O
section O
, O
the O
waiter B-AS
replied O
that O
there O
were O
no O
open O
tables B-AS
. O

When O
we O
showed O
up O
, O
the O
guy B-AS
at O
the O
door O
said O
it O
would O
be O
15 O
minutes O
and O
that O
we O
could O
wait O
by O
the O
bar B-AS
. O

Caffeine O
addicts O
will O
have O
to O
find O
their O
fix O
elsewhere O
as O
coffee O
is O
curiously O
not O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
but O
the O
Singha O
beer O
and O
decent O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
more O
than O
compensates O
. O

Good O
value B-AS
for I-AS
money I-AS
- O
- O
especially O
the O
$ O
7 O
lunch O
special O
for O
2 O
courses B-AS
. O

Dinner B-AS
is O
a O
tad O
dodgy O
, O
especially O
if O
you O
don O
' O
t O
eat O
meat B-AS
or O
fish O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
decent O
but O
small O
portions B-AS
so O
expect O
to O
order O
a O
lot O
. O

Comfort B-AS
is O
decidedly O
not O
a O
factor O
in O
the O
Arturo O
' O
s O
experience O
- O
- O
once O
patrons O
escape O
the O
bottleneck O
near O
the O
bar B-AS
, O
they O
' O
re O
shoehorned O
into O
a O
miniscule O
dining O
room O
. O

Then O
the O
huffy O
hostess B-AS
when O
we O
asked O
to O
be O
seated O
at O
a O
table B-AS
not O
directly O
on O
- O
top O
of O
another O
couple O
. O

Remember O
the O
80 O
' O
s O
when O
you O
have O
to O
wait O
1 O
- O
2 O
hours O
for O
a O
table B-AS
even O
though O
you O
have O
a O
reservation B-AS
+ O
the O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
treated O
you O
like O
the O
idiot O
that O
you O
are O
for O
paying O
$ O
2 O
- O
300 O
per O
head O
for O
this O
treatment O
, O
then O
you O
should O
definately O
come O
to O
experience O
this O
jewel O
! O
! O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
the O
food B-AS
was O
good O
but O
not O
awesome O
as O
had O
been O
described O
, O
furthermore O
I O
found O
the O
portions B-AS
fairly O
small O
for O
this O
type O
of O
restaurant O
. O

The O
owner B-AS
Don O
greeted O
us O
at O
the O
door O
with O
a O
warm O
smile O
, O
and O
seated O
us O
for O
dinner B-AS
upstairs O
. O

Our O
waitress B-AS
couldn O
' O
t O
tell O
us O
what O
was O
in O
the O
seafood O
special O
, O
forgot O
to O
put O
in O
our O
oyster O
order O
so O
it O
came O
at O
the O
same O
time O
as O
the O
main B-AS
meals I-AS
, O
wasn O
' O
t O
able O
to O
provide O
a O
confident O
recommendation O
from O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
and O
had O
to O
be O
flagged O
several O
times O
for O
drinks B-AS
. O

Went O
for O
an O
early O
V B-AS
- I-AS
Day I-AS
dinner I-AS
, O
only O
to O
be O
highly O
disappointed O
by O
the O
service B-AS
. O

Staff B-AS
would O
not O
change O
a O
meal B-AS
to O
accomadidate O
food B-AS
allegeries O
. O

We O
waited O
FOREVER O
on O
Valentine O
' O
s O
Day O
for O
our O
table B-AS
because O
their O
hostess B-AS
had O
lost O
our O
reservation O
BUT O
the O
food B-AS
was O
worthy O
of O
the O
long O
wait B-AS
anyway I-AS
. O

Flavorful O
Indian O
favorites O
like O
vegetable B-AS
pakora I-AS
, O
lamb B-AS
tikka I-AS
masala I-AS
and I-AS
tandoori I-AS
chicken I-AS
, O
as O
well O
as O
unexpected O
offerings O
such O
as O
Alaska B-AS
king I-AS
crab I-AS
legs I-AS
and I-AS
fried I-AS
coconut I-AS
shrimp I-AS
, O
are O
served O
at O
extremely O
reasonable O
prices B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
on O
the O
good O
side O
but O
not O
so O
terrific O
to O
compensate O
the O
bad O
service B-AS
, O
crammed O
tiny O
- O
tables O
, O
dirty O
glasses B-AS
, O
overly O
loud O
music O
, O
which O
is O
good O
for O
the O
bar O
part O
of O
the O
establishment O
but O
not O
when O
you O
want O
to O
seat O
down O
, O
eat O
and O
have O
a O
normal O
conversation O
at O
normal O
volume O
. O

I O
was O
disappointed O
to O
hear O
another O
waiter B-AS
( O
or O
it O
could O
' O
ve O
been O
the O
owner B-AS
) O
was O
reading O
completely O
different O
specials B-AS
( O
most O
of O
which O
I O
would O
' O
ve O
wanted O
to O
try O
if O
I O
didn O
' O
t O
overhear O
at O
the O
end O
of O
our O
meal O
) O
to O
the O
table O
next O
to O
us O
. O

our O
waiter B-AS
from O
last O
year O
, O
a O
young O
man O
named O
Chris O
, O
actually O
remembered O
us O
( O
we O
did O
speak O
at O
length O
that O
evening O
about O
everything O
from O
food O
and O
wine B-AS
to O
how O
to O
create O
good O
marrige O
) O
. O

As O
a O
chef B-AS
I O
really O
appreciated O
the O
well O
executed O
dishes B-AS
that O
were O
full O
of O
crisp O
and O
vibrant O
flavor B-AS
contrast O
acting O
in O
harmony O
and O
perfect O
balance O
. O

The O
service B-AS
can O
be O
a O
bit O
spotty O
since O
they O
are O
sometimes O
busy O
taking O
phone O
orders O
to O
attend O
to O
the O
restaurant O
patrons O
so O
make O
sure O
you O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
to O
spare O
when O
you O
go O
there O
for O
dinner B-AS
. O

atmosphere B-AS
is O
not O
that O
relaxing O
, O
if O
you O
go O
- O
you O
MUST O
bring O
a O
cell O
phone O
and O
go O
down O
the O
street O
for O
a O
drink B-AS
. O

This O
pizza B-AS
shop O
is O
one O
o O
fhte O
best O
places O
ever O
and O
is O
a O
hiden O
gem O
in O
a O
small O
community B-AS
. O

After O
being O
seated O
outside O
by O
the O
host B-AS
, O
a O
waitress B-AS
came O
over O
and O
yelled O
at O
us O
for O
taking O
a O
table O
that O
belonged O
to O
people O
waiting B-AS
at O
the O
bar O
. O

after O
booking O
reservations B-AS
at O
Danube O
, O
only O
to O
show O
up O
and O
not O
have O
any O
tables B-AS
available O
, O
the O
Danube O
somelier O
graciously O
called O
over O
to O
Bouley O
and O
got O
us O
a O
table O
for O
immediate O
seating B-AS
. O

Highlights O
include O
a O

, O
and O
a O
top B-AS
- I-AS
shelf I-AS
roasted I-AS
chicken I-AS
with O
rapini O
and O
sausage O
. O

I O
was O
a O
bit O
taken O
aback O
by O
the O
paper O
napkins O
and O
the O
flyer B-AS
like O
menu B-AS
, O
but O
was O
excited O
nevertheless O
to O
taste O
the O
food B-AS
praised O
by O
at O
least O
6 O
people O
on O
this O
site O
. O

The O
tables B-AS
weren O
' O
t O
bussed O
and O
they O
forgot O
to O
make O
my O
chai O
tea O
, O
which O
wasn O
' O
t O
all O
that O
delicious O
, O
not O
was O
my O
friend O
' O
s O
coffee B-AS
. O

Service B-AS
is O
FAST O
so O
if O
you O
are O
dining O
, O
order O
entrees B-AS
after O
receiving O
apps O
. O

Upon O
finishing O
our O
meal O
that O
same O
waitress B-AS
that O
ignored O
us O
, O
suddenly O
appeared O
at O
our O
table O
asking O
if O
we O
needed O
our O
check O
, O
we O
were O
finishing O
our O
coffee O
and O
drinks B-AS
, O
yet O
she O
was O
blatantly O
trying O
to O
get O
us O
out O
so O
that O
the O
table O
could O
be O
turned O
over O
. O

The O
kinds O
of O
places O
like O
this O
where O
strangers O
are O
likely O
to O
share O
a O
table O
during O
the O
lunch B-AS
rush O
always O
have O
better O
food B-AS
than O
the O
Table O
- O
cloth O
places O
. O

You O
' O
ll O
find O
classic O
PS450 B-AS
dishes I-AS
like O
the O
sliced B-AS
steak I-AS
atop O
creamed O
spinich O
on O
crunchy O
little O
toasts O
and O
new O
items B-AS
like O
brie O
poppers B-AS
on O
drizzled O
strawberry O
- O
infused O
sauce B-AS
. O

Our O
waiter B-AS
recommended O
thZt O
we O
share O
a O
few O
of O
the O
appetizers B-AS
; O
they O
were O
great O
. O

I O
went O
here O
for O
a O
fun O
dinner B-AS
with O
friends O
- O
they O
do O
not O
take O
reservations O
during O
the O
week O
, O
but O
we O
were O
seated O
pretty O
swiftly O
for O
a O
Friday O
night O
, O
having O
had O
a O
delicious O
glass B-AS
of I-AS
Spanish I-AS
wine I-AS
at O
the O
bar B-AS
. O

We O
were O
just O
settling O
the O
bill B-AS
, O
when O
a O
waiter B-AS
I O
can O
only O
assume O
held O
a O
controlling O
interest O
in O
the O
restaurant O
( O
else O
he O
would O
' O
ve O
been O
fired O
long O
ago O
) O
came O
to O
the O
table O
and O
demanded O
to O
know O
why O
someone O
( O
our O
friend O
who O
' O
d O
briefly O
left O
to O
use O
the O
restroom O
) O
had O
left O
her O
beer O
half B-AS
- I-AS
full I-AS
. O

My O
only O
gripe O
was O
that O
the O
food O
was O
all O
in O
big O
bins O
, O
but O
that O
' O
s O
expected O
for O
a O
lunch B-AS
rush O
hour O
type O
crowd B-AS
. O

I O
' O
ve O
been O
here O
twice O
for O
brunch B-AS
, O
and O
I O
found O
the O
ambience B-AS
and O
food O
to O
be O
much O
better O
than O
the O
overly O
- O
hyped O
Kitchenette O
next O
door O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
just O
ok O
, O
not O
really O
memorable O
and O
not O
what O
you O
expect O
for O
the O
price B-AS
but O
I O
guess O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
what O
you O
pay O
for O
. O

What O
I O
liked O
the O
most O
is O
that O
the O
staff B-AS
listened O
attentively O
to O
what O
I O
asked O
for O
and O
my O
meal B-AS
was O
prepared O
EXACTLY O
the O
way O
I O
asked O
, O
what O
a O
treat O
. O

The O
drinks B-AS
were O
water O
down O
and O
the O
only O
BIG O
thing O
was O
the O
bill B-AS
. O

Its O
not O
cheap O
, O
it O
was O
$ O
10 O
for O
a O
burger B-AS
and O
fries O
, O
and O
when O
i O
was O
there O
, O
the O
waiter B-AS
had O
dropped O
a O
FULL O
glass B-AS
of O
coke O
on O
a O
patron O
, O
soaking O
her O
through O
! O

Our O
bill B-AS
total O
was O
only O
$ O
30 O
and O
our O
waiter B-AS
threw O
in O
a O
side O
of O
linguini O
( O
no O
charge O
) O
since O
the O
entrees B-AS
don O
' O
t O
come O
with O
pasta B-AS
sides I-AS
. O

The O
reservation B-AS
was O
easy O
enough O
to O
make O
the O
night O
before O
for O
a O
Saturday O
night O
( O
after O
the O
pre O
- O
theater O
crowd B-AS
) O
. O

There O
was O
3 O
baby B-AS
carrots I-AS
, O
a O
spoon O
full O
of O
spinach B-AS
, O
sun B-AS
dried I-AS
tomatoes I-AS
, O
3 O
pieces O
of O
eggplant B-AS
, O
and O
10 O
string O
beans O
, O
oh O
and O
onions B-AS
. O

Last O
time O
I O
was O
there O
the O
chef B-AS
made O
me O
a O
special O
dessert B-AS
called O
yokan B-AS
( O
red O
bean O
cake O
with O
strawberry O
sauce O
on O
top O
) O
and O
it O
was O
delicious O
. O

If O
you O
don O
' O
t O
mind O
eating O
great O
thai B-AS
food I-AS
in O
a O
schnazzy O
ambience B-AS
with O
a O
hop O
hip O
lunch B-AS
crowd I-AS
, O
then O
come O
on O
over O
to O
SPICE O
. O

Decor B-AS
is O
sort O
of O
homey O
, O
with O
mismatched O
tables B-AS
and O
plates O
. O

Generally O
one O
would O
have O
to O
point O
out O
to O
the O
waitstaff B-AS
the O
beer B-AS
was O
flat O
and O
ask O
for O
another O
. O

Though O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
about O
45 O
minutes O
from O
our O
dinner O
reservation O
time O
, O
we O
were O
given O
breadsticks O
, O
olives B-AS
and O
parmasean O
to O
nibble O
on O
while O
we O
waited O
, O
albeit O
in O
the O
very O
cramped O
bar B-AS
area I-AS
. O

Finally O
, O
one O
of O
the O
waitstaff B-AS
noticed O
and O
brought O
out O
a O
dirty O
bus O
pan O
which O
he O
put O
on O
the O
table O
next O
to O
me O
and O
started O
bussing O
the O
entire O
dining B-AS
room I-AS
. O

We O
sat O
soaked O
in O
red B-AS
wine I-AS
for O
20 O
minutes O
eating O
our O
meals B-AS
w O
/ O
o O
the O
wine O
b O
/ O
c O
the O
server B-AS
saw O
us O
like O
that O
but O
did O
nothing O
until O
we O
stopped O
him O
. O

Our O
party O
of O
4 O
ordered O
only O
appetizers B-AS
( O
about O
6 O
of O
them O
) O
and O
made O
a O
wonderful O
meal B-AS
out O
of O
it O
. O

In O
addition O
guys O
, O
please O
hire O
some O
waitstaff B-AS
who O
know O
both O
English O
and O
your O
menu B-AS
. O

The O
menu B-AS
features O
such O
sumptuous O
fare B-AS
as O
lobster B-AS
ravioli I-AS
in I-AS
a I-AS
light I-AS
aurora I-AS
sauce I-AS
, O
double B-AS
- I-AS
cut I-AS
grilled I-AS
veal I-AS
chop I-AS
with O
an O
aromatic B-AS
salsa I-AS
verde I-AS
, O
and O
octopus B-AS
salad I-AS
with I-AS
steamed I-AS
potato I-AS
, I-AS
red I-AS
onions I-AS
, O
and O
caper O
berries B-AS
. O

The O
soft B-AS
shell I-AS
chicken I-AS
taco I-AS
is O
alright O
, O
but O
nobody O
would O
go O
here O
for O
serious O
Mexican B-AS
food I-AS
. O

I O
asked O
the O
waitress B-AS
what O
this O
was O
for O
and O
her O
responses O
were O
as O
follows O
: O
We O
put O
in O
an O
extra O
shot O
, O
We O
had O
to O
use O
ice O
in O
the O
drink B-AS
, O
and O
It O
must O
have O
been O
the O
computer O
. O

The O
bill B-AS
came O
out O
to O
quite O
a O
lot O
though O
, O
considering O
there O
were O
14 O
of O
us O
some O
of O
us O
ordered O
way O
too O
many O
drinks B-AS
. O

Although O
the O
waitress B-AS
had O
clearly O
our O
reservation B-AS
on O
her O
book O
, O
she O
told O
us O
somebody O
arrived O
one O
minute O
ago O
and O
being O
first O
to O
arrive O
, O
he O
could O
have O
our O
table O
. O

The O
Food O
Guiltily O
scarf O
down O
fried B-AS
catfish I-AS
sandwiches I-AS
and O
collard B-AS
greens I-AS
, O
or O
try O
Clinton O
' O
s O
favorite O
: O
short O
ribs B-AS
and O
fried B-AS
chicken I-AS
. O

The O
waitress B-AS
took O
about O
20 O
minutes O
to O
bring O
us O
the O
menu B-AS
. O

After O
arriving O
an O
hour O
early O
for O
our O
reservation B-AS
for O
2 O
and O
politely O
asking O
for O
a O
table O
near O
the O
band B-AS
we O
were O
promptly O
seated O
at O
one O
of O
the O
worst O
tables B-AS
in O
the O
place O
. O

we O
ordered O
simple O
salads B-AS
, O
which O
were O
outrageous O
in O
price B-AS
and O
def O
. O

It O
' O
s O
just O
nice O
to O
have O
a O
place O
like O
this O
- O
a O
sit O
down O
place O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
food B-AS
choices I-AS
, O
not O
centered O
on O
a O
particular O
ethnicity O
and O
a O
bar B-AS
- O
as O
an O
option O
here O
. O

There O
were O
a O
few O
moments B-AS
during O
the O
tasting O
menu B-AS
that O
left O
me O
speechless O
, O
such O
as O
the O
shrimp B-AS
in I-AS
cream I-AS
sauce I-AS
, O
toro O
with O
foam O
, O
foie O
gras O
custard O
, O
eggplant B-AS
in I-AS
miso I-AS
and O
a O
foie O
gras O
kobe O
beef O
filet O
fried O
ball O
that O
brought O
me O
to O
tears O
. O

All O
dishes B-AS
have O
been O
adjusted O
for O
American O
preferences O
( O
bland O
, O
missing O
spices B-AS
and O
wok O
heat O
) O
. O

There O
is O
almost O
always O
an O
hour O
wait O
at O
dinner B-AS
time O
, O
but O
this O
may O
be O
the O
best O
Japanese B-AS
Sushi O
restaurant O
in O
NYC O
. O

We O
waited O
forever O
for O
our O
bill B-AS
but O
did O
have O
a O
nice O
conversation O
with O
one O
of O
our O
waitstaff B-AS
during O
our O
meal O
. O

Watch O
out O
for O
the O
sesame B-AS
noodles I-AS
, O
though O
, O
and O
leave O
the O
complimentary O
pickled O
cabbage O
and O
carrots O
sitting O
on O
the O
table B-AS
for O
the O
next O
customer O
to O
enjoy O
. O

My O
fiance O
and O
I O
always O
get O
mussels B-AS
a O
la O
Cono O
and O
linguine O
a O
la O
Cono O
, O
but O
all O
the O
other O
pasta B-AS
dishes I-AS
I O
' O
ve O
tried O
have O
been O
good O
or O
excellent O
. O

I O
would O
say O
that O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
was O
nothing O
amazing O
, O
I O
didn O
' O
t O
feel O
like O
the O
authenticity O
of O
the O
history O
of O
the O
place B-AS
was O
nearly O
as O
prevelant O
as O
it O
could O
have O
been O
in O
the O
experience O
. O

If O
it O
' O
s O
not O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
ask O
for O
the O
string B-AS
bean I-AS
and I-AS
goat I-AS
cheese I-AS
salad O
- O
delicious O
. O

I O
had O
a O
party O
of O
9 O
reservation B-AS
and O
was O
very O
disappointed O
at O
the O
service B-AS
. O

Fifteen O
minutes O
later O
, O
when O
we O
asked O
about O
our O
drinks B-AS
, O
another O
server B-AS
went O
to O
investigate O
and O
found O
that O
they O
' O
d O
run O
out O
of O
one O
of O
the O
liqueurs O
they O
needed O
and O
had O
gone O
out O
to O
get O
more O
- O
- O
which O
is O
fine O
, O
but O
it O
would O
' O
ve O
been O
nice O
to O
know O
. O

WHen O
I O
politely O
asked O
for O
a O
water B-AS
he O
pointed O
to O
the O
waiter B-AS
and O
looked O
the O
other O
way O
! O

Waiters B-AS
take O
your O
order O
and O
you O
don O
' O
t O
get O
your O
food B-AS
for O
at O
least O
1 O
hour O
so O
you O
can O
prchase O
drinks B-AS
. O

Frustrated O
, O
hand O
the O
check B-AS
back O
to O
the O
server B-AS
and O
said O
' O
by O
the O
way O
, O
never O
got O
the O
dessert O
and O
he O
said O
i O
did O
not O
realize O
you O
wanted O
dessert O
' O

We O
got O
so O
frustrated O
with O
our O
waitress B-AS
, O
who O
stopped O
by O
twice O
over O
the O
course O
of O
2 O
1 O
/ O
2 O
hours O
, O
that O
we O
had O
to O
order O
everything O
from O
the O
bar B-AS
. O

The O
complete O
and O
total O
rudeness O
and O
frustration O
surrounding O
this O
place O
started O
with O
the O
hostess B-AS
calling O
us O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
afternoon B-AS
asking O
if O
we O
could O
change O
our O
reservation B-AS
. O

However O
, O
the O
appetizers B-AS
I O
' O
ve O
tried O
( O
rolls B-AS
, O
calamari B-AS
, O
fish B-AS
fingers O
) O
were O
really O
delicious O
. O

service O
was O
reasonably O
quick O
via O
delivery B-AS
, O
but O
the O
hunan B-AS
beef I-AS
had O
no O
spice O
whatsoever O
and O
the O
chicken O
chow O
mein O
really O
looked O
inedible O
. O

Go O
have O
a O
drink O
there O
the O
space B-AS
is O
beautiful O
and O
buy O
an O
appetizer B-AS
maybe O
, O
but O
pass O
on O
dinner B-AS
, O
not O
well O
cooked O
and O
small O
portions B-AS
. O

The O
steaks B-AS
are O
just O
as O
good O
, O
with O
an O
assortment B-AS
of O
tasty O
side B-AS
dishes I-AS
that O
make O
Peter O
Luger O
' O
s O
menu B-AS
look O
like O
the O
slip O
in O
a O
fortune O
cookie O
. O

Food B-AS
was O
so O
- O
so O
, O
but O
it O
was O
the O
most O
awful O
dinner B-AS
I O
experienced O
in O
my O
life O
. O

For O
a O
menu O
in O
a O
similar O
price B-AS
range I-AS
with O
some O
similar O
items O
, O
but O
mostly O
unique O
entrees B-AS
, O
try O
the O
less O
formal O
Toast O
13 O
or O
so O
blocks O
north O
on O
the O
same O
side O
of O
Broadway O
. O

The O
feeling O
of O
unwelcomeness O
was O
especially O
prevalent O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
our O
waiter B-AS
hovered O
over O
our O
table O
and O
immediately O
cleared O
the O
table B-AS
of I-AS
dishes I-AS
and O
glasses O
, O
some O
of O
which O
were O
still O
full O
in O
order O
to O
get O
us O
out O
the O
door O
ASAP O
. O

They O
seem O
under O
staffed O
and O
Waiters B-AS
do O
not O
really O
know O
the O
menu B-AS
. O

The O
manager B-AS
( O
or O
someone O
very O
important O
that O
was O
able O
to O
be O
seated O
1 O
/ O
2 O
hour O
before O
opening O
) O
sat O
in O
the O
corner B-AS
, O
with O
a O
glass B-AS
of I-AS
wine I-AS
, O
a O
date O
, O
and O
talked O
on O
his O
cell O
for O
about O
an O
hour O
, O
loudly O
, O
while O
the O
first O
arrivals O
were O
sent O
to O
the O
hotel O
tearoom O
next O
door O
. O

It O
still O
took O
a O
little O
while O
to O
get O
our O
drinks B-AS
and O
food O
- O
But O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
made O
up O
for O
it O
. O

Manager B-AS
couldn O
' O
t O
be O
bothered O
to O
come O
over O
and O
acknowledge O
the O
mistake B-AS
. O

This O
place O
has O
great O
ribs B-AS
, O
not O
to O
mention O
hot O
waitresses B-AS
, O
its O
a O
great O
place O
to O
meet O
for O
drinks B-AS
and O
dinner B-AS
before O
you O
go O
out O
, O
but O
it O
does O
turn O
into O
a O
bit O
of O
a O
sausage B-AS
fest I-AS
on O
the O
weekends O
. O

You O
may O
as O
well O
just O
extend O
the O
bar B-AS
into O
the O
restaurant O
since O
it O
has O
already O
penetrated O
it O
with O
loud O
music B-AS
, O
loud O
voices O
, O
and O
a O
remarkable O
amount O
of O
cigarette O
smoke B-AS
. O

After O
I O
had O
complained O
to O
a O
bouncer O
( O
the O
manager B-AS
would O
not O
see O
me O
) O
a O
waiter B-AS
was O
sent O
over O
and O
did O
get O
us O
our O
drinks B-AS
. O

After O
waiting B-AS
for O
90 O
minutes O
, O
the O
host B-AS
gave O
away O
our O
table B-AS
to O
a O
couple O
who O
arrived O
after O
us O
. O

We O
had O
to O
ask O
FIFTEEN O
TIMES O
for O
water B-AS
, O
we O
had O
no O
idea O
what O
we O
were O
eating O
( O
due O
to O
incomprehensible O
serving B-AS
staff I-AS
) O
, O
waited O
25 O
minutes O
after O
asking O
for O
our O
bill O
, O
and O
were O
charged O
a O
20 O
% O
corking O
fee O
ON O
WINE O
WE O
BOUGHT O
THERE O
. O

The O
server B-AS
( O
Jasmine O
) O
checked O
up O
on O
us O
periodically O
and O
was O
patient O
as O
she O
explained O
certain O
menu B-AS
items I-AS
. O

The O
waitress B-AS
saw O
a O
couple O
of O
us O
struggling O
with O
the O
menu B-AS
and O
I O
felt O
she O
was O
frustrated O
with O
us O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
unattentive O
and O
the O
only O
time O
she O
came O
over O
was O
to O
aggressively O
push O
drinks B-AS
on O
us O
. O

However O
, O
unlike O
a O
lot O
of O
places O
the O
service B-AS
was O
great O
: O
we O
walked O
in O
after O
not O
being O
able O
to O
get O
a O
reservation B-AS
and O
were O
seated O
within O
10 O
mins O
. O

I O
asked O
the O
waiter B-AS
to O
move O
us O
to O
another O
table B-AS
because O
we O
didn O
' O
t O
want O
to O
rush O
our O
meal B-AS
. O

The O
waitress B-AS
was O
friendly O
but O
did O
not O
know O
the O
menu B-AS
and O
had O
to O
run O
to O
the O
kitchen O
after O
each O
question O
. O

It O
is O
far O
more O
popular O
as O
a O
bar O
than O
as O
a O
restaurant O
, O
with O
only O
a O
few O
tables B-AS
and O
the O
waiter O
being O
the O
bartender O
, O
but O
we O
greatly O
enjoyed O
the O
unobtrusive O
atmosphere B-AS
. O

The O
drinkers B-AS
beside O
us O
had O
fresh O
glasses O
of O
water O
brought O
on O
trays B-AS
to O
replace O
the O
empties O
and O
a O
smiling O
waitress B-AS
to O
cater O
to O
their O
every O
whim O
. O

They O
ended O
up O
cramming O
10 O
of O
us O
on O
3 O
small O
tables B-AS
, O
then O
taking O
forever O
with O
our O
food B-AS
. O

I O
could O
not O
get O
a O
reservation B-AS
on O
the O
phone O
and O
when O
I O
arrived O
they O
would O
not O
seat B-AS
us O
even O
though O
they O
were O
half O
empty O
. O

I O
was O
told O
they O
had O
one O
( O
early O
) O
reservation B-AS
; O
felt O
deceived O
b O
/ O
c O
when O
I O
left O
the O
place B-AS
was O
empty O

For O
appetizers O

, O

, O
great O
convesation B-AS
, O
expect O
to O
spend O
a O
couple O
of O
hours O
. O

Most O
of O
the O
staff B-AS
are O
friendly O
but O
if O
you O
' O
re O
unlucky O
enough O
to O
be O
served O
by O
the O
waitress B-AS
that O
isn O
' O
t O
, O
then O
the O
experience O
can O
be O
rather O
unpleasant O
. O

When O
after O
2 O
hours O
we O
did O
ask O
for O
our O
entrees B-AS
, O
the O
waiter B-AS
and O
busboy B-AS
were O
both O
extremely O
rude O
. O

As O
we O
looked O
at O
the O
menu B-AS
and O
the O
wine O
list O
, O
my O
friend O
overheard O
the O
manager B-AS
comment O
to O
a O
waitress O
about O
me O
that O
the O
least O
he O
could O
do O
is O
wear O
a O
button O
down O
shirt O
, O
and O
not O
show O
up O
dressed O
like O
a O
Gristede O

I O
' O

not O
going O
to O

the O
place B-AS
simply O
because O
I O
had O
a O
bad O
experience O
there O

but O
here O
' O
s O
the O
facts O
: O
the O
food B-AS

the O

Spoke O

we O

paid O

My O
boyfriend O

I O
loved O
Imagine O
Bar B-AS

Grill B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
at O
Cafe O
Asean O
is O
to O
die O
for O
, O
and O
the O
prices B-AS
are O
unmatchable O
. O

Our O
waitress B-AS
recommended O
the O
coffee B-AS
flan I-AS
for O
dessert B-AS
, O
and O
we O
didn O
' O
t O
regret O
it O
. O

Food B-AS
was O
fresh O

dull O

for O

The O

out O
the O

dish O
three O
times O
during O
the O

Our O
waitress O
had O
no O
clue O
about O
the O
menu B-AS
and O
( O
after O
we O
had O
ordered O
a O
bottle B-AS
of I-AS
wine I-AS
) O
told O
us O
the O
kitchen B-AS
was O
closing O
and O
stood O
guard O
until O
we O
ordered O
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
was O
able O
to O
answer O
any O
questions O
I O
had O
about O
the O
wine B-AS
or O
food B-AS
. O

IT O
' O
S O
GREAT O
COFFEE B-AS
BUT O
THE O
SERVICE B-AS
IS O
SERVED B-AS
WITH O
BIG O
TIME O
ATTITUDE O
. O

Once O
they O
took O
our O
wine B-AS
order O
, O
it O
took O
45 O
minutes O
for O
it O
to O
arrive O
, O
even O
though O
the O
waiter B-AS
was O
talking O
to O
a O
patron O
next O
to O
us O
. O

I O
would O
only O
go O
back O
for O
a O
lobster B-AS
roll I-AS
at O
lunch B-AS
. O

The O
ambience O
and O
service B-AS
here O
are O
great O
but O
the O
food B-AS
was O
really O
awful O
. O

For O
a O
4 O
- O
star O
restaurant O
( O
not O
to O
mention O
a O
$ O
400 O
dinner B-AS
for O

) O
, O
attentive O
service B-AS
is O
expected O
. O

Our O
waiter B-AS
( O
who O
also O
seemed O
to O
be O
the O
manager B-AS
) O
dropped O
red O
wine O
all O
over O
me O
the O
contents O
of O
my O
purse O
and O
all O
he O
did O
was O
apologize O
quickly O
, O
hand O
me O
some O
club B-AS
soda I-AS
and O
avoid O
me O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
time O
I O
was O
there O
. O

My O
only O
complaint O
was O
the O
ginger B-AS
iced I-AS
tea I-AS
was O
too O
sugary O
- O
but O
the O
home B-AS
- I-AS
made I-AS
fresh I-AS
lemonade I-AS
was O
very O
tasty O
and O
fresh O
. O

Beyond O
the O
green O
awning O
and O
floor O
- O
to O
- O
ceiling O
windows O

sophisticated O
( O
and O
often O
European O
) O
patrons O
drink B-AS
wine I-AS
from O
the O
bar B-AS
in O
back O
and O
dine B-AS
on O
French B-AS
fare I-AS
like O
nicoise O
salad O
, O
foie O
gras O
, O
and O
steak B-AS
tartare I-AS
at O
tightly O
packed O
tables B-AS
. O

Definitely O
try O
their O
Pizzas B-AS
and O
Wines B-AS
- O
- O
although O
their O
desserts B-AS
are O
not O
- O
to O
- O
shabby O
either O
. O

We O
ordered O
the O
steak B-AS
for O
four O
and O
some O
side O
dishes O
( O
the O
cream B-AS
spinach I-AS
was O
a O
bit O
salty O
, O
but O
the O
German B-AS
fries I-AS
was O
really O
good O
) O
. O

For O
entrees B-AS
, O
Manzo O

melt O
in O
your O
mouth O
beef O
medallions O
complemented O
by O
plump O
, O
sweet O
raisins B-AS

Too O
bad O
the O
food B-AS
and O
service B-AS
aren O
' O
t O
nearly O
as O
nice O
as O
the O
decor B-AS
. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
go O
there O
only O
go O
for O
drinks B-AS
and O
the O
atmosphere O
b O
/ O
c O
the O
food B-AS
is O
definitly O
not O
worth O
it O
! O
! O

The O
appetizers B-AS
were O
delicious O
and O
the O
entrees B-AS
were O
superb O
( O
the O
mahi B-AS
was O
a O
little O
bland O
, O
but O
I O
guess O
you O
can O
' O
t O
win O
them O
all O
) O
. O

The O
ambience B-AS
isn O
' O
t O
great O
but O
the O
food B-AS
is O
so O
tasty O
and O
so O
reasonably O
priced B-AS
that O
it O
' O
s O
definitely O
a O
fun O
date O
place O
if O
you O
want O
to O
get O
a O
bunch O
of O
stuff O
and O
sample O
. O

Oh O
, O
the O
prices B-AS
were O
not O
so O
bad O
either O
, O
we O
paid O
$ O
58 O
for O
chicken O
, O
salmon B-AS
, O
one O
sushi O
roll O
, O
one O
ceasar O
salad O
and O
soda B-AS
: O
) O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
average O
the O
prices B-AS
high O
and O
the O
whole O
experience O
was O
very O
upsetting O
. O

We O
had O
to O
wait O
30 O
minutes O
before O
the O
waiter B-AS
even O
came O
to O
our O
table O
and O
had O
to O
ask O
4 O
times O
just O
to O
get O
a O
glass B-AS
of I-AS
water I-AS
. O

The O
ice B-AS
cream I-AS
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
meal B-AS
was O
a O
surprise O
and O
I O
loved O
it O
. O

Chicken B-AS
options I-AS
are O
fantastic O
, O
notably O
chicken O
with O
spices B-AS
. O

The O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
didn O
' O
t O
look O
all O
that O
great O
, O
but O
there O
was O
a O
very O
interesting O
selection O
of O
beers B-AS
on O
tap B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
of O
a O
relatively O
high O
standard O
, O
except O
the O
oysters B-AS
seemed O
a O
little O
off O
. O

Good O
food B-AS
, O
but O
bad O
service B-AS
. O

Oh O
yeah O
, O
the O
food B-AS
' O
s O
just O
alright O
for O
the O
price B-AS
. O

Further O
, O
our O
waiter B-AS
was O
basically O
inattentive O
through O
the O
entire O
dinner B-AS
( O
e O
. O

Our O
waitress B-AS
was O
pleasent O
and O
patient O
as O
we O
asked O
about O
all O
the O
various O
types O
of O
sushi B-AS
. O

My O
boyfriend O
' O
s O
halibut B-AS
was O
slightly O
undercooked O
, O
so O
he O
sent O
it O
back O
- O
- O
the O
result O
was O
not O
only O
a O
fresh O
piece O
of O
perfectly O
cooked O
fish O
, O
but O
also O
a O
complimentary O
spread B-AS
of O
FOUR O
desserts B-AS
! O

I O
went O
back O
a O
different O
night O
, O
once O
again O
I O
can O
' O
t O
remember O
which O
, O
probably O
Friday O
and O
the O
place B-AS
was O
a O
ghost O
town O
, O
with O
a O
corny O
DJ O
and O
a O
waitress B-AS
who O
couldn O
' O
t O
get O
my O
friend O
' O
s O
drink B-AS
right O
after O
several O
tries O
. O

Our O
waitress B-AS
took O
our O
order O
and O
then O
NEVER O
came O
back O
to O
our O
table B-AS
. O

For O
appetizers B-AS
we O
ordered O
Chicken O
Samosas O
and O
Lasooni O
Gobi O
and O
for O
main O
course O
we O
ordered O
Chicken B-AS
Tikka I-AS
Masala I-AS
, O
Lamb B-AS
Pasanda I-AS
and O
Saag B-AS
Paneer I-AS
they O
were O
all O
just O
scrumptious O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
was O
nice O
in O
the O
front O
room O
, O
but O
despite O
a O
reservation B-AS
, O
we O
were O
relegated O
to O
the O
rear O
, O
where O
we O
were O
treated O
like O
stepchildren O
- O
we O
had O
to O
flag O
someone O
down O
to O
take O
our O
order O
, O
water O
with O
no O
ice O
, O
we O
had O
to O
ask O
for O
extras O
( O
as O
opposed O
to O
someone O
asking O
if O
we O
needed O
something O
else O
) O
. O

The O
owner B-AS
addressed O
me O
by O
my O
first O
name O
after O
my O
second O
visit O
The O
garlic B-AS
shrimp I-AS
is O
a O
hit O
and O
the O
Sangria O
( O
the O
bartender B-AS
on O
Fridays O
mixes O
the O
drink B-AS
in O
three O
ways O
) O
. O

Sure O
, O
the O
waitresses B-AS
are O
hot O
, O
but O
you O
' O
ll O
have O
to O
wait O
30 O
minutes O
just O
to O
get O
your O
drinks B-AS
. O

The O
guy B-AS
was O
pleasant O
and O
friendly O
but O
that O
only O
goes O
so O
far O
when O
you O
are O
hungry O
and O
have O
to O
wait O
2 O
hours O
for O
a O
pizza B-AS
. O

Try O
the O
shrimp B-AS
and I-AS
bacon I-AS
hash I-AS
with O
a O
perfectly O
spicy O
bloody O
or O
two O
, O
what O
a O
brunch B-AS
should O
be O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
worth O
it O
, O
but O
I O
suggest O
you O
order O
delivery B-AS
, O
so O
that O
you O
don O
' O
t O
have O
to O
read O
old O
issues O
of O
Robb O
Report O
while O
you O
wait O
forever O
in O
a O
small O
and O
hot O
room B-AS
. O

Dessert B-AS
: O
Creme B-AS
Brulee I-AS
- I-AS
it I-AS
was O
okay O
, O
it O
started O
off O
warm O
on O
the O
edges O
then O
it O
got O
really O
cold O
in O
the O
middle O
. O

She O
was O
very O
helpful O
in O
suggesting O
us O
drinks B-AS
and O
helped O
us O
in O
ordering O
a O
lot O
of O
good O
dishes B-AS
since O
we O
knew O
nothing O
about O
Indian B-AS
food I-AS
. O

Try O
the O
blk B-AS
fettucine I-AS
with O
the O
lobster B-AS
or O
the O
cioppino B-AS
. O

Then O
the O
waiter B-AS
acted O
indignant O
when O
we O
called O
him O
out O
for O
bring O
us O
the O
wrong O
( O
later O
) O
vintage O
of O
wine B-AS
we O
picked O
out O
. O

The O
Sushi O
was O
of O
the O
highest O
caliber O
, O
the O
cut O
as O
if O
a O
master O
samurai O
marks O
smith O
was O
behind O
the O
bar B-AS
, O
and O
service B-AS
, O
just O
what O
you O
would O
expect O
from O
a O
fine O
dining O
establishment B-AS
, O
New O
York O
style O
. O

Waitress B-AS
we O
had O
appered O
to O
be O
very O
impatient O
, O
didn O
' O
t O
know O
the O
name O
of O
the O
fish O
in O
English O
, O
apptizer O
came O
when O
we O
were O
having O
entree B-AS
and O
she O
made O
no O
apology O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
definitely O
the O
attraction O
, O
but O
the O
service B-AS
has O
been O
consistently O
bad O
on O
every O
visit O
. O

I O
excused O
myself O
from O
my O
table O
went O
downstairs O
to O
inform O
the O
hostess B-AS
that O
I O
would O
like O
to O
suprise O
my O
dinner B-AS
guest O
by O
recognizing O
his O
birthday O
in O
a O
very O
understated O
way O
. O

The O
Filet B-AS
Mignon I-AS
is O
awesome O
, O
along O
with O
everything O
else O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
. O

) O
And O
don O
' O
t O
forget O
the O
svc O
, O
those O
waiters B-AS
stare O
at O
you O
your O
entire O
meal B-AS
, O
just O
waiting B-AS
for O
you O
to O
put O
your O
fork B-AS
down O
and O
they O
snatch O
the O
plate O
away O
in O
a O
second O
. O

The O
waitress B-AS
really O
struggled O
with O
anything O
more O
complicated O
than O
that O
- O
- O
not O
sure O
if O
it O
was O
a O
language O
problem O
or O
what O
, O
but O
3 O
of O
the O
4 O
drinks B-AS
we O
ordered O
came O
both O
late O
and O
wrong O
, O
including O
beer B-AS
brought O
in O
place O
of O
a O
cocktail B-AS
, O
the O
wrong O
wine B-AS
, O
and O
a O
mystery B-AS
drink I-AS
that O
nobody O
had O
ordered O
. O

While O
getting O
a O
reservation B-AS
upstairs O
can O
be O
a O
pain O
, O
stopping O
by O
on O
Saturday O
night O
for O
a O
dinner B-AS
by O
the B-AS
window I-AS
is O
a O
fun O
way O
to O
experience O
Babbo O
without O
the O
long O
term O
planning O
. O

The O
Scene B-AS
Uncomplicated O
, O
tasteful O
touches O
- O
- O
a O
soothing O
abstract O
painting O

the O

Freshly O
shucked O
oysters O

to O
purists O

while O
classicists O

One O
price B-AS
for O
dinner B-AS
left O
for O
no O
surprises O
. O

The O
burritos B-AS
are O
so O
great O
, O
I O
crave O
them O
while O
I O
am O
sitting O
at O
my O
desk O
and O
dreaming O
about O
lunch B-AS
. O

Dishes B-AS
are O
best O
shared O
with O
groups O
, O
as O
are O
the O
pitchers O
of O
sangria B-AS
. O

I O
lived O
next O
door O
and O
loved O
to O
go O
down O
for O
a O
drink O
at O
their O
uplit O
marble O
bar B-AS
under O
the O
beautiful O
lighting B-AS
or O
sit O
by O
the O
fireplace O
when O
the O
live B-AS
band I-AS
is O
not O
playing O
. O

Not O
the O
most O
beautiful O
environment B-AS
, O
but O
the O
food B-AS
is O
consistently O
delicious O
and O
the O
barbeque O
is O
fun O
and O
tasty O
. O

And O
the O
waiter B-AS
actually O
replied O
, O
yes O
that O
' O
s O
why O
it O
took O
you O
so O
long O
to O
get O
a O
reservation B-AS
. O

The O
not O
- O
so O
- O
friendly O
- O
cigarette O
- O
reeking O
waiter B-AS
asked O
if O
we O
had O
any O
questions O
then O
when O
we O
did O
ask O
, O
he O
rolled O
his O
eyes O
and O
covered O
his O
face O
with O
the O
menu B-AS
to O
say O
something O
to O
a O
passing O
coworker O
. O

The O
staff O
beginning O
with O
the O
tall O
gentleman B-AS
at O
the O
door B-AS
, O
waiters O
, O
etc O
. O

No O
one O
bothered O
to O
ask O
if O
we O
were O
enjoying O
our O
food B-AS
or O
whether O
or O
not O
we O
wanted O
more O
to O
drink B-AS
( O
we O
apparently O
needed O
to O
be O
out O
by O
8 O
) O
. O

The O
kitchen B-AS
nails I-AS
pasta I-AS
dishes I-AS
, O
including O
spicy O
linguine B-AS
with I-AS
clams I-AS
and O
pancetta O
and O
perfect O
gnocchi B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
took O
forever O
to O
come O
out O
from O
the O
kitchen B-AS
. O

Though O
the O
service B-AS
might O
be O
a O
little O
slow O
, O
the O
waitresses B-AS
are O
very O
friendly O
. O

Went O
to O
Butter O
on O
Monday O
night O
for O
a O
friend O
' O
s O
birthday O
dinner B-AS
at O
like O
11 O
: O
00pm O
, O
the O
kitchen B-AS
was O
supposedly O
closed O
, O
but O
we O
spoke O
to O
the O
manager B-AS
and O
we O
were O
seated O
promptly O
. O

Favorites O
include O
the O
Curry B-AS
Shrimp I-AS
w I-AS
/ I-AS
Mushrooms I-AS

listed O
on O
menu B-AS
) O
, O
and O
Kao O
Soy B-AS
noodle I-AS
soup I-AS
with I-AS
chicken I-AS
. O

I O
wouldn O
' O
t O
go O
for O
dinner B-AS
though O
cause O
it O
gets O
too O
crowded O
and O
the O
takeout B-AS
at O
night O
is O
very O
slow O
. O

My O
complaint O
was O
with O
the O
service O
- O
- O
our O
waitress B-AS
was O
rather O
pushy O
and O
visibly O
annoyed O
when O
we O
didn O
' O
t O
order O
appetizers B-AS
or O
dessert B-AS
. O

I O
have O
definately O
found O
my O
new O
favorite O
place B-AS
for O
dinner B-AS
and O
with O
its O
large O
bar B-AS
for O
hanging O
out O
on O
the O
weekends O
. O

The O
Maryland B-AS
Crabcake I-AS
roll I-AS
is O
good O
too O
if O
you O
are O
not O
into O
raw O
fish B-AS
. O

Despite O
talking O
to O
the O
weekday O
manager B-AS
on O
the O
prior O
Monday O
, O
who O
gave O
me O
a O
hard O
time O
but O
agreed O
to O
make O
a O
reservation B-AS
for O
me O
since O
my O
group O
was O
so O
big O
. O

There O
' O
s O
also O
a O
weekend O
brunch B-AS
, O
big O
on B-AS
poached I-AS
eggs I-AS
, O
omelets B-AS
and O
bagels B-AS
and O
lox O
, O
plus O
fresh O
- O
squeezed O
OJ B-AS
. O

When O
they O
brought O
out O
the O
food B-AS
the O
waiter B-AS
dropped O
one O
of O
the O
plates O
right O
in O
front O
of O
us O
and O
didn O
' O
t O
appologize O
or O
bring O
us O
out O
a O
complimentry O
plate O
. O

Our O
waitress B-AS
' O
visits O
to O
our O
table B-AS
were O
few O
and O
far O
between O
. O

I O
write O
that O
in O
quotes O
becuase O
iceberg B-AS
lettuce I-AS
, O
stale O
Pepperidge O
Farm O
croutons O
and O
bottled B-AS
dressing I-AS
does O
not O
a O
salad O
make O
. O

The O
pork B-AS
was O
good O
but O
3 O
small O
medalians O
and O
2 O
tablespoons O
of O
mashed O
potatos O
does O
not O
make O
a O
meal B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
and O
wine B-AS
selection I-AS
is O
superb O
and O
the O
chef B-AS
brings O
it O
all O
together O
each O
and O
every O
time O
. O

The O
place B-AS
is O
full O
of O
flavor B-AS
and O
color O
and O
the O
music B-AS
just O
puts O
you O
in O
the O
mood O
for O
food B-AS
and O
drinks B-AS
. O

I O
went O
on O
a O
Saturday O
night O
on O
the O
recommendation O
of O
the O
new B-AS
General I-AS
Manager I-AS
, O
Mike O
who O
also O
did O
Cheetah O
Club B-AS
and O
Le O
Souk O
. O

The O
food B-AS
will O
eventually O
make O
you O
outweigh O
Anna O
Nicole O
Smith B-AS
. O

A O
huge O
water O
wall O
, O
pieced O
together O
with O
thousands O
of O
azure O
blue B-AS
tiles I-AS
dotted O
with O
white O
plaster B-AS
body O
forms O
in O
mid O
- O
swan O
dive O
, O
rises O
up O
from O
the O
foyer O
to O
the O
second O
floor O
. O

Come O
to O
people O
watch O
and O
drink B-AS
, O
but O
stay O
away O
from O
the O
food B-AS
and O
service B-AS
. O

When O
the O
manager B-AS
was O
asked O
for O
things O
did O
imporve O
but O
2 O
hours O
to O
get O
our O
meal B-AS
. O

Music B-AS
was O
blasting O
( O
speakers O
located O
practically O
on O
top O
of O
every O
table O
) O
, O
and O
we O
asked O
the O
waitress B-AS
if O
they O
can O
turn O
it O
down O
. O

The O
Scene B-AS
Though O
plenty O
of O
white O
- O
washed O
tables B-AS
and O
chairs B-AS
are O
scattered O
about O
the O
dining B-AS
room I-AS
, O
it O
' O
s O
the O
bar B-AS
that O
acts O
as O
a O
neighborhood O
gathering O
place O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
only O
average O
- O
even O
with O
reservations B-AS
we O
waited O
40 O
minutes O
, O
and O
had O
to O
ask O
for O
our O
table B-AS
, O
which O
had O
been O
ready O
, O
the O
hostess B-AS
just O
never O
bothered O
to O
tell O
us O
. O

Good O
place B-AS
for O
groups O
of O
four O
or O
large O
parties O
but O
it O
is O
not O
a O
cozy O
/ O
intimate O
setting B-AS
for O
2 O
although O
the O
jazz O
helps O
! O

Interior B-AS
is O
limited O
, O
but O
there O
is O
a O
second O
floor O
for O
dining B-AS
to O
avoid O
some O
of O
the O
main O
floor O
chatter O
. O

Definitely O
make O
reservations B-AS
if O
you O
can O
- O
- O
they O
' O
ll O
honor O
them O
, O
and O
you O
can O
skip O
the O
massive O
wait B-AS
! O

In O
edition O
, O
they O
have O
pasta B-AS
and O
other O
entree B-AS
choices O
along O
with O
an O
excellent O
quick O
breakfast B-AS
( O
omlet O
and O
homefries O
ext O
) O
. O

The O
only O
reason O
they O
seem O
to O
taste O
so O
good O
is O
because O
the O
food B-AS
is O
well O
decorated O
with O
its O
super O
small O
portion B-AS
. O

Don O
' O
t O
they O
teach O
their O
staff B-AS
how O
to O
pour O
water B-AS
or I-AS
wine I-AS
? O

worth O
every O
penny B-AS
, O
and O
with O
the O
deals B-AS
on O
the O
bar B-AS
, O
you O
could O
drink B-AS
and O
sing O
to O
CURRYoke O
all O
night O
, O
, O
, O
, O

We O
were O
a O
couple O
of O
minutes O
late O
for O
our O
reservation B-AS
and O
minus O
one O
guest O
, O
but O
we O
didn O
' O
t O
think O
we O
deserved O
the O
attitude O
we O
got O
from O
the O
hostess B-AS
. O

The O
menu B-AS
features O
American B-AS
bistro I-AS
dishes I-AS
like O
crab B-AS
cakes I-AS
, O
chicken B-AS
under O
a O
brick O
, O
fresh O
oysters O
and O
various O
seafood B-AS
dishes I-AS
. O

It O
' O
s O
a O
good O
place O
to O
meet O
up O
with O
a O
friend O
while O
shopping O
, O
grab O
lunch O
( O
although O
the O
lines B-AS
do O
get O
long O
) O
, O
dining B-AS
solo O
, O
or O
to O
take O
home O
after O

I O
got O
a O
coke O
and O
dessert B-AS
( O
fluffy O
, O
light O
tiramisu B-AS
) O
as O
well O
. O

Went O
there O
for O
a O
dinner B-AS
; O
nice O
little O
place B-AS
. O

my O
waitress B-AS
was O
unable O
to O
answer O
my O
questions O
about O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
and O
forgot O
to O
put O
in O
my O
order O
. O

The O
noise B-AS
level O
is O
equivalent O
to O
a O
sports O
bar B-AS
. O

To O
sum O
it O
up O
, O
the O
steak B-AS
is O
indeed O
the O
best O
out O
there O
, O
but O
the O
servers B-AS
and O
especially O
the O
hosts B-AS
are O
big O
time O
jerks O
. O

This O
Prospect O
Heights O
institution O

its O

from O

. O

For O
appetizers B-AS

I O
' O

recommend O
the O
soft B-AS
shell I-AS
crab I-AS
, O
spicy B-AS
New I-AS

mussels I-AS
, O
calamari B-AS
and O
anything O
from O
the O
sushi B-AS
bar I-AS
. O

A O
cute O
restaurant O
and O
average O
food B-AS
( O
with O
a O
small O
menu B-AS
) O
. O

The O
staff B-AS
was O
accomodating O
towards O
our O
daughter O
and O
nice O
enough O
to O
check O
up O
on O
her O
after O
they O
served B-AS
dinner I-AS
( O
I O
was O
a O
little O
concerned O
about O
the O
spices B-AS
and O
they O
suggested O
a O
dish O
) O
. O

Food B-AS
was O
good O
although O
menu B-AS
was O
a O
little O
limited O
( O
still O
plenty O
to O
chose O
from O
) O
. O

The O
manager B-AS
then O
comes O
over O
to O
the O
table O
and O
asks O
us O
to O
leave O
- O
to O
help O
him O
out O
because O
there O
were O
people O
waiting B-AS
! O

The O
service B-AS
was O
good O
enough O
for O
a O
crowded O
place B-AS
. O

So O
we O
left O
, O
the O
menu B-AS
looked O
decent O
but O
you O
have O
to O
go O
when O
you O
can O
get O
one O
of O
the O
2 O
or O
3 O
tables B-AS
. O

Don O
' O
t O
forget O
to O
order O
a O
raspberry B-AS
lemonade I-AS
or O
your O
brunch B-AS
will O
not O
be O
complete O
! O

The O
guacamole B-AS
at O
$ O
7 O
is O
a O
small O
portion B-AS
served O
with O
a O
stack O
of O
Si O
! O
Ortega O
flat O
taco O
shells B-AS
. O

I O
went O
there O
for O
a O
late O
dinner B-AS
last O
night O
with O
a O
friend O
and O
the O
service B-AS
was O
aweful O
. O

As O
for O

the B-AS

not O
the O
tomato O

; O
it O
' O
s O
got O
a O
tang O
I O
didn O
' O

like O

There O
were O
sesame B-AS
seeds O
on O
the O
outside O
( O
it O
' O

pizza O

not O
a O
hamburger B-AS

) O
, O
barely O
any O
sauce O
, O
VERY O
thin O
slices O
of O
mozzarella O
sparingly O
applied O
and O
topped O
with O
lots O
of O
herbs O
. O

you O
might O
have O
made O
a O
reservation B-AS
, O
but O
you O
will O
end O
up O
waiting B-AS
for O
about O
an O
hour O
anyway O
, O
so O
hopefully O
you O
' O
ll O
get O
a O
seat B-AS
at O
the O
bar B-AS
and O
won O
' O
t O
have O
to O
stand O
around O
. O

Then O
the O
waitress B-AS
became O
upset O
when O
she O
returned O
with O
the O
drinks B-AS
and O
we O
didn O
' O
t O
stop O
our O
conversations O
quick O
enough O
to O
remind O
her O
who O
had O
ordered O
what O
only O
5 O
minutes O
prior O
. O

Sit O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
and O
eat O
here O
regularly O
and O
the O
sushi B-AS
chef I-AS
who O
is O
also O
the O
owner B-AS
will O
hook O
you O
up O
the O
best O
cuts O
of O
fish B-AS
. O

maybe O
we O
ordered O
the O
wrong O
items O
because O
the O
food B-AS
was O
not O
spectacular O
, O
with O
the O
exception O
of O
the O
poppy O
- O
seeded O
sweet O
beet B-AS
ravioli I-AS
appetizer I-AS
. O

I O
' O
m O
from O
Italy O
and O
i O
felt O
home O
great O
and O
fresh O
food O
, O
good O
pizza B-AS
, O
i O
been O
there O
few O
times O
and O
i O
always O
go O
with O
the O
special B-AS
or O
seafood B-AS
, O
about O
dessert B-AS
try O
the O
profitterol O
. O

We O
poked O
our O
heads O
in O
for O
a O
few O
bottles O
of O
wine O
, O
some O
good O
hot B-AS
onion I-AS
soup I-AS
and O
a O
few O
hot B-AS
appetizers I-AS
to O
warm O
us O
up O
after O
a O
seeing O
a O
show O
. O

That O
being O
said O
, O
they O
do O
have O
a O
nice O
lounge B-AS
area I-AS
downstairs O
where O
you O
can O
just O
hang O
out O
, O
have O
a O
seat O
, O
and O
relax O
( O
no O
more O
waiting B-AS
out O
in O
the O
cold O
or O
at O
the O
crowded O
bar B-AS
) O
. O

The O
Food B-AS
Most O
restaurants O
with O
more O
than O
250 O
items O
on O
the O
regular B-AS
menu I-AS
don O
' O
t O
do O
any O
of O
them O
particularly O
well O
. O

Patrons O
can O
choose O
to O
be O
seated O
in O
the O
front O
room O
with O
a O
little O
more O
activity O
and O
more O
of O
a O
bar B-AS
feel O
or O
in O
one O
of O
the O
2 O
back B-AS
rooms I-AS
which O
both O
offer O
slightly O
quieter O
, O
more O
relaxed O
environments B-AS
. O

When O
you O
go O
, O
you O
should O
ask O
for O
help O
from O
the O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
in O
deciding O
what O
to O
order O
since O
the O
menu B-AS
can O
be O
daunting O
. O

The O
whole B-AS
fish I-AS
was O
excellent O
- O
- O
not O
overcooked O
and O
served B-AS
in O
a O
light B-AS
tomato I-AS
broth I-AS
. O

I O
love O
the O
decor B-AS
but O
would O
not O
recommend O
sitting O
in O
the O
communal O
tables O
unless O
its O
a O
very O
big O
group O
, O
much O
more O
fun O
getting O
a O
table O
and O
people O
watch O
while O
you O
chomp O
on O
your O
$ O
20 O
palm O
sized B-AS
truffle I-AS
pizza I-AS
. O

I O
prefer O
to O
sit O
in O
the O
lounge O
area O
or O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
, O
as O
the O
service B-AS
is O
quicker O
and O
the O
space B-AS
is O
more O
attractive O
. O

I O
went O
back O
to O
telly O
' O
s O
because O
i O
heard O
that O
they O
changed O
the O
Chef B-AS
and O
the O
food B-AS
was O
again O
, O
after O
a O
very O
very O
small O
break O
, O
was O
excellent O
again O
. O

It O
' O
s O
really O
great O
to O
go O
in O
here O
and O
be O
able O
to O
get O
a O
creative O
cheap O
drink B-AS
( O
they O
have O
things O
like O
blueberry B-AS
mohitos I-AS
for O
$ O
4 O
) O
, O
a O
$ O
4 O
plate O
of O
veggie B-AS
spring I-AS
rolls I-AS
, O
and O
be O
able O
to O
joke O
with O
the O
bartender B-AS
. O

Tension B-AS
filled O
the O
air B-AS
as O
the O
chief O
yelled O
at O
a O
waiter B-AS
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
bar B-AS
while O
in O
uniform O
and O
drinking O
. O

For O

, O
the O
oversized B-AS

can O
' O
t O
be O
beat O
. O

I O
don O
' O
t O
have O
much O
to O
say O
about O
the O
cafe O
itself O
; O
you O
can O
order O
out O
from O
the O
family O
- O
run O
cafe O
in O
the O
front O
, O
or O
take O
a O
seat B-AS
in O
the O
back O
, O
which O
opens O
up O
to O
the O
outdoors O
and O
can O
offer O
a O
less O
seedy O
and O
more O
homey O
atmosphere B-AS
. O

from O
the O
sandwich B-AS
wraps I-AS
and O
hot O
italian B-AS
dishes I-AS
to O
the O
creative O
pizzas B-AS

The O
Food O
While O
there O
are O
plenty O
of O
meat B-AS
dishes I-AS
, O
including O
the O

the O
menu O

95 O
all O
- O
you O
- O
can O
- O
eat O
lunch O
is O
tooted O
as O
a O
good O
deal O
but O
a O
the O
ambiance O
is O
dreadful O
and O
you O
can O
get O
a O
terrific O
meal B-AS
, O
also O
kosher O
vegetarian B-AS
, O
in O
peace O
with O
service B-AS
just O
around O
the O
corner O
for O
$ O
2 O
more O
. O

Good O
atmosphere B-AS
, O
the O
service O
is O
so O
- O
so O
and O
there O
is O
a O
long O
wait B-AS
if O
you O
don O
' O
t O
have O
reservations O
. O

Even O
a O
modest O
bottle B-AS
of I-AS
wine I-AS
was O
accurately O
described O
by O
the O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
and O
pleasing O
. O

I O
definitely O
liked O
the O
vibe B-AS
in O
the O
restaurant O
- O
the O
food B-AS
is O
good O
with O
enough O
variety O
to O
please O
everyone O
- O
i O
' O
d O
say O
the O
portions B-AS
were O
quite O
skimpy O
where O
it O
counts O
- O
meat O
whether O
fish B-AS
or O
steak O
- O
and O
for O
those O
prices O
this O
is O
very O
irksome O
. O

went O
there O
for O
dinner B-AS
over O
the O
weekend O
and O
was O
treated O
rudely O
right O
away O
by O
what O
I O
think O
was O
a O
manager B-AS
who O
was O
doing O
anything O
but O
managing O
. O

Come O
- O
as O
- O
you O
- O
are O
atmosphere B-AS
, O
jukebox B-AS
, O
value B-AS
and O
James O
behind O
the O
bar B-AS
work O
as O
a O
magnet O
. O

Our O
waiter B-AS
never O
once O
came O
by O
the O
table B-AS
to O
ask O
us O
how O
our O
meal O
was O
. O

My O
dinner B-AS
partner O
ordered O
the O
angel O
hair B-AS
with O
seafood O
- O
the O
portion B-AS
was O
easily O
big O
enough O
for O
two O
. O

After O
waiting B-AS
almost O
an O
hour O
for O
a O
table O
( O
with O
resies O
) O
our O
waiter B-AS
told O
us O
that O
they O
don O
' O
t O
have O
a O
sommelier O
because O
no O
steakhouse O
has O
a O
sommelier O
( O
patently O
false O
) O
, O
and O
finished O
with O
the O
notion O
that O
he O
had O
absolutely O
no O
idea O
about O
any O
of O
the O
wines B-AS
on O
the O
list O
. O

Great O
food B-AS
as O
usual O
, O
the O
paella B-AS
valenciana O
our O
fave O
and O
oooh O
those O
coconut B-AS
mojitos I-AS
ahh O
! O

waitstaff B-AS
was O
more O
into O
pushing O
the O
sparkling O
water B-AS
than O
give O
me O
a O
wine B-AS
menu I-AS
. O

There O
was O
a O
nice O
atmosphere B-AS
except O
for O
the O
few O
pompous O
patrons O
who O
looked O
way O
too O
gaudy O
or O
a O
lunch B-AS
time O
meal B-AS
, O
but O
overall O
its O
a O
great O
place O
to O
eat O
. O

The O
place B-AS
is O
huge O
, O
but O
it O
' O
s O
always O
packed O
with O
people O
waiting O
to O
be O
seated O
because O
they O
made O
the O
mistake O
of O
not O
making O
a O
reservation B-AS
! O

I O
had O
to O
ask O
the O
waiter B-AS
a O
couple O
of O
times O
to O
clear O
our O
empty O
glasses B-AS
. O

The O
place B-AS
was O
empty O
( O
my O
boyfriend O
and O
I O
were O
the O
only O
one O
' O
s O
there O
other O
than O
the O
potty O
- O
mouthed O
patron O
' O
s O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
) O
yet O
the O
service B-AS
was O
slow O
. O

It O
looks O
like O
a O
dive O
but O
serves O
up O
fresh O
authentic O
Mexican B-AS
fare I-AS
you O
won O
' O
t O
normally O
find O
in O
your O
average O
Tex O
- O
Mex O
style O
restaraunt B-AS
. O

THE O
SERVICE O
- O
we O
had O
a O
reservation B-AS
, O
they O
took O
forever O
to O
seat B-AS
us O
and O
when O
they O
did O
we O
didn O
' O
t O
see O
a O
waiter B-AS
for O
about O
15 O
minutes O
and O
he O
acted O
as O
if O
we O
were O
at O
some O
drive O
thru O
, O
rushing O
us O
and O
then O
ignoring O
our O
table O
( O
actually O
we O
hardly O
saw O
him O
at O
all O
) O
throughout O
the O
night B-AS
. O

) O
Howver O
, O
we O
didn O
' O
t O
expect O
to O
be O
bumped O
by O
waiters B-AS
a O
few O
times O
during O
our O
dinner B-AS
. O

The O
momos B-AS
( I-AS
dumplings I-AS
) I-AS
are O
tiny O
with O
paper O
- O
thin O
dough B-AS
, O
the O
shitake B-AS
pancakes I-AS
are O
to O
die O
for O
, O
the O
steamed B-AS
greens I-AS
( O
I O
forgot O
the O
name O
of O
the O
dish B-AS
) O
is O
delicious O
as O
a O
vegetarian O
entry O
or O
with O
sauteed O
salmon B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
undeniably O
good O
- O
- O
but O
not O
worth O
the O
wait B-AS
. O

Had O
an O
after O
- O
work O
drink B-AS
at O
the O
bar B-AS
with O
a O
date O
, O
loved O
the O
place B-AS
so O
much O
we O
came O
back O
for O
brunch B-AS
the O
next O
morning O
. O

You O
have O
to O
be O
comfortable O
eating O
with O
your O
hands O
, O
sharing O
the O
same O
plate B-AS
with O
your O
friends O
and O
be O
able O
to O
handle O
spicy O
food O
( O
not O
as O
spicy O
as O
some O
thai B-AS
dishes I-AS
though O
) O
. O

Last O
night O
was O
our O
second O
time O
dining B-AS
here O
and O
we O
are O
still O
amazed O
with O
the O
food B-AS
. O

The O
cod B-AS
was O
very O
good O
but O
a O
bit O
soupy O
in O
vegetable B-AS
juices I-AS
. O

It O
' O
s O
not O
going O
to O
win O
any O
awards O
for O
its O
decor B-AS
, O
but O
the O
food B-AS
is O
good O
, O
the O
portions B-AS
are O
big O
, O
and O
the O
prices B-AS
are O
low O
. O

Later O
, O
as O
our O
large O
party O
began O
filtering O
out O
, O
I O
overheard O
our O
waiter O
discussing O
the O
menu B-AS
mixup O
to O
about O
5 O
members O
of O
the O
staff B-AS
, O
blaming O
us O
. O

Atmosphere B-AS
, O
I O
' O
d O
give O
to O
Rosa O
or O
Maya O
, O
but O
Mexican B-AS
fare I-AS
at O
Zarela O
is O
tops O
. O

The O
manager B-AS
never O
came O
to O
our O
table O
and O
the O
restaurant O
didn O
' O
t O
offer O
anything O
to O
compensate O
for O
the O
error O
( O
they O
could O
have O
taken O
the O
two O
cocktails B-AS
off O
the O
check O
) O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
heard O
all O
the O
complaints O
about O
food B-AS
and O
staff B-AS
at O
this O
place B-AS
, O
and O
perhaps O
some O
people O
have O
had O
an O
unfortunate O
encounter O
with O
the O
host O
or O
a O
cranky O
waiter B-AS
. O

for O
the O
prices B-AS
that O
are O
on O
the O
regular O
menu B-AS
we O
were O
expecting O
something O
more O
upscale O
and O
less O
generic O
. O

Ok O
the O
manager B-AS
did O
stand O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
the O
whole O
time O
looking O
like O
his O
wife O
left O
him O
, O
he O
lost O
all O
his O
money O
at O
the O
track O
and O
had O
been O
drinking O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
day O
. O

The O
waitress B-AS
recommended O
four O
courses B-AS
, O
not O
three O
, O
given O
their O
tiny O
size B-AS
. O

We O
were O
the O
only O
two O
people O
sitting O
out O
front O
and O
the O
waiter O
was O
unable O
to O
provide O
us O
with O
attentive O
service B-AS
OR O
our O
dinner B-AS
. O

no O
need O
for O
reservation B-AS
) O
you O
' O
d O
expect O
the O
crew B-AS
to O
be O
alittle O
more O
attentive O
. O

While O
I O
love O
this O
place B-AS
, O
I O
do O
recommend O
going O
here O
mostly O
for O
lunch B-AS
or O
an O
early O
dinner B-AS
because O
the O
crowd O
and O
long O
wait B-AS
can O
be O
annoying O
. O

Service B-AS
wasn O
' O
t O
great O
- O
they O
accidentally O
gave O
us O
our O
neighbors O
' O
entrees O
, O
and O
there O
was O
a O
good O
40 O
- O
minute O
wait O
between O
appetizers O
and O
main B-AS
courses I-AS
- O
but O
the O
food B-AS
was O
overall O
very O
good O
, O
particularly O
the O
desserts B-AS
. O

The O
Scene B-AS
Strictly O
Roots O
, O
which O
opened O
more O
than O
a O
decade O
ago O
as O
a O
dietary O
alternative O
to O
Harlem O
' O
s O
more O
cholesterol O
- O
and O
fat O
- O
heavy O
fare B-AS
, O
wears O
its O
philosophy O
on O
its O
facade O
: O
We O
serve O
nothing O
that O
crawls O
, O
walks O
, O
swims O
or O
flies O
. O

The O
presentation B-AS
was O
clever O
, O
and O
the O
food B-AS
tasty O
however O
the O
service B-AS
that O
accompanied O
it O
was O
so O
slow O
it O
made O
us O
feel O
neglected O
. O

The O
menu B-AS
prices I-AS
are O
a O
bit O
expensive O
for O
what O
you O
get O
in O
quality B-AS
and O
portion B-AS
size I-AS
. O

Mom O
' O
s O
cooking B-AS
without O
the O
meat B-AS
, O
the O
not O
- O
terribly O
- O
diverse O
but O
tempting O
nonetheless O
dinner B-AS
menu I-AS
is O
both O
filling O
and O
comforting O
, O
and O
the O
modest O
outer O
- O
boroughs O
price B-AS
tag I-AS
makes O
this O
place O
a O
definite O
return O
visit O
, O
particularly O
since O
it O
' O
s O
only O
one O
train O
stop O
outside O
the O
city O
. O

Food B-AS
is O
okay O
for O
the O
price B-AS
, O
however O
there O
is O
definitely O
better O
thai O
restaurants O
! O
! O

In O
Short O
Though O
it O
' O
s O
more O
of O
a O
takeout O
and O
delivery B-AS
operation O
than O
a O
sit O
- O
down O
restaurant O
, O
Risotteria O
does O
offer O
eight O
small O
tables B-AS
for O
those O
who O
want O
to O
savor O
their O
risotto B-AS
hot O
off O
the O
stove O
. O

The O
manager B-AS
came O
out O
very O
defensively O
and O
insisted O
that O
it O
was O
a O
2 O
lb O
lobster B-AS
. O

The O
waiters B-AS

though O
not O
French O
, O
knew O
his O
Bordeaux O
, O
and O
our O
server B-AS
was O
delightful O
. O

After O
dinner B-AS
we O
ordered O
a O
hookah O
and O
after O
20 O
minutes O
waitress B-AS
comes O
by O
and O
tried O
to O
take O
it O
away O
because O
she O
claims O
our O
table O
is O
reserve O
for O
another O
group O
in O
10 O
minute O

of O

so O
if O
that O
is O
your O
thing O
go O
to O

The O
scene B-AS
is O
pretty O
cool O
and O
the O
drinks B-AS
are O
OK O
, O
but O
the O
food O
and O
service B-AS
were O
pretty O
weak O
. O

Once O
the O
food B-AS
came O
, O
we O
could O
not O
eat O
because O
we O
did O
not O
have O
the O
little O
plates B-AS
for O
the O
soy B-AS

The O
menu O
is O
divided O
up O
into O
several O
sections O
, O
and O
most O
of O
the O
dishes B-AS
are O
smallish O
plates B-AS
, O
like O

not O
much O
better O

in O
one O
day O
asking O
for O
a O
table B-AS
for O
a O

by O
a O

A O
guest O
from O

was O
here O

and O

The O
Scene B-AS
Petite O
Abeille O
is O
ideal O
for O
a O
lazy O
lunch B-AS
, O
a O
restorative O
brunch B-AS
or O
light O
dinner B-AS
. O

They O
bring O
over O
your O
favorite O
beverage O
before O
you O
sit O
down O
and O
while O
dining B-AS
you O
listen O
to O
a O
killer O
jukebox B-AS
. O

Don O
' O
t O
let O
the O
decor B-AS
fool O
you O
because O
you O
will O
miss O
out O
in O
some O
of O
the O
best O
food B-AS
you O
ever O
eaten O
. O

In O
Short O
A O
dark O
, O
narrow O
takeout B-AS
area O
gives O
way O
to O
small O
tables O
in O
a O
cozy O

decorated O
to O
resemble O
a O
Bedouin O

Spinache O

I O
use O
to O
always O
get O
the O
turkey B-AS
club I-AS
, O
until O
recently O
where O
I O
have O
gotten O
more O
bread B-AS
than O
turkey O
. O

The O
decor B-AS
is O
worth O
a O
mention O
, O
with O
plush O
seating O
areas O
that O
range O
from O
bar B-AS
stools O
to O
table O
/ O

to O
full O

The O
Food B-AS
The O
menu O
is O
better O
suited O
to O
the O
snacking B-AS
at O
the O
long O
bar B-AS
than O
dining O
in O
the O
compact O
dining O
area O
. O

Another O
favorite O
is O
the O
hanger B-AS
steak I-AS
which O
is O
always O
cooked O
to O
perfection O
and O
served O
with O
a O
generous O
amount B-AS
of I-AS
arugula I-AS
and O
a B-AS
balsamic I-AS
vinegar I-AS
reduction I-AS
served I-AS
as O
a O
sauce B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
served B-AS
promptly O
but O
the O
meal O
wasn O
' O
t O
rushed O
- O
we O
had O
plenty O
of O
time O
to O
enjoy O
the O
appetizers B-AS
and O
our O
entrees O
as O
well O
as O
sit O
and O
chat O
while O
finishing O
up O
our O
drinks O
even O
after O
we O
paid O
. O

When O
I O
got O
home O
, O
there O
was O
a O
message O
on O
the O
machine O
because O
the O
owner B-AS
realized O
that O
our O
waitress B-AS
forgot O
to O
charge O
us O
for O
our O
wine B-AS
. O

The O
Scene B-AS
Shun O
Lee O
Palace O
is O
popular O
with O
midtown O
locals O
, O
possibly O
because O
the O
upscale O
room O
means O
you O
can O
impress O
a O
client O
and O
have O
Chinese O
for O
lunch B-AS
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

To O
both O
our O
surprise O
, O
this O
inquiry O
was O
interpreted O
as O
a O
personal O
offense O
by O
the O
waiter B-AS
who O
told O
my O
wife O
to O
leave O
the O
store O
if O
she O
didnt O
want O
the O
pastries B-AS
. O

In O
fact O
you O
can O
find O
their O
menu B-AS
offerings O
at O
other O
places O
for O
better O
qualities O
and O
lower O
prices B-AS
. O

Been O
here O
a O
few O
times O
and O
food B-AS
has O
always O
been O
good O
but O
service B-AS
really O
suffers O
when O
it O
gets O
crowded O
. O

It O
' O
s O
sad O
that O
everything O
about O
this O
place O
was O
great O
( O
even O
the O
service B-AS
and O
decor B-AS
) O
except O
for O
the O
steak B-AS
. O

to O
be O
honest O
we O
only O
had O
drinks O
and O
appetizers B-AS
downstairs O
as O
we O
were O
there O
for O
a O
collegues O
leaving O
drinks O
but O
the O
staff B-AS
was O
very O
friendly O
( O
typical O
aussies O
) O
and O
the O
food B-AS
i O
did O
have O
was O
pretty O
darn O
good O
. O

The O
brasserie B-AS

style I-AS
menu I-AS

and O
various O
burgers B-AS
and O
sandwiches O
. O

we O
all O
liked O
the O
brunch B-AS
items O
we O
had O
but O
when O
we O
later O
asked O
if O
the O
chips B-AS
were O
supposed O
to O
come O
with O
the O
meal O
, O
the O
waitress B-AS
explained O
it O
away O
by O
saying O
sometimes O
they O
forget O
instead O
of O
apologizing O
and O
offering O
something O
extra O
. O

Appetizers B-AS
are O
the O
safest O
bet O

including O
a O

Instead O

4 O

the O

staff I-AS
were O
giggling O
and O
carrying O
on O
at O
the O

We O
had O
to O
wait O
20 O
minutes O
before O
getting O
a O
beer B-AS
, O
and O
we O
never O
got O
our O
burger O

The O
waitress B-AS
forgot O
our O
coffee B-AS
, O
took O
forever O
to O
take O
our O
order O
, O
never O
checked O
in O
with O
us O
after O
the O

came O

we O
were O
done O
, O
didn O
' O

bring O
us O
the O

the O
longest O
time O

We O
had O
no O
problems O
with O
our O
resevations O
and O
found O
the O
service B-AS
and O
the O
meal B-AS
well O
worth O
a O

had O
we O
run O
into O

My O

I O
have O
nothing O

about O
the O

the O
Food B-AS

While O
waiting B-AS
for O
a O
table B-AS
, O
tried O
to O
get O
a O
drink B-AS
from O
a O
bartender O
who O
seemed O
more O
interested O
in O
arguing O
with O
his O
waiters B-AS
. O

There O
should O
be O
more O
choices O
of O
items O
to O
load O
on O
the O

still O
quality O
of O

The O
meat B-AS

good O
as O
was O

I O
' O

go O
back O
if O
I O
could O
forego O
the O

Went O
here O
with O
my O
husband O
on O
a O
Saturday O
night O
for O
dinner B-AS
since O
the O
place B-AS
looked O
like O
it O
had O
great O
atmosphere B-AS
. O

The O
bartender B-AS
, O
the O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
and O
management O
all O
put O
the O
customer B-AS
first O
and O
that O
was O
clear O
and O
much O
appreciated B-AS
. O

I O
find O
the O
attitude B-AS
of O
the O
managers B-AS
to O
be O
appallingly O
superior O
, O
and O
the O
food B-AS
below O
average O
, O
at O
sky O
- O
high O
prices O
. O

I O
recently O
ate O
Brunch B-AS
there O
and O
was O
dismayed O
and O
dissapointed O
by O
the O
service B-AS
. O

) O
The O
food B-AS
was O
good O
, O
but O
not O
at O
all O
worth O
the O
price B-AS
. O

He O
described O
the O
specials B-AS
in O
great O
detail O
and O
gave O
wine B-AS
and O
appertizer O
suggestions O
. O

The O
portions B-AS
were O
kid O
sized O
and O
we O
spent O
about O
$ O
100 O
a O
person O
in O
cluding B-AS
wine I-AS
( O
4 O
of O
us O
) O
. O

My O
only O
quibbles O
are O
service B-AS
- O
which O
was O
confused O
( O
we O
waited O
10 O
minutes O
for O
menus B-AS
) O
, O
and O
the O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
, O
which O
is O
over O
- O
the O
- O
top O
expensive O
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
made O
a O
huge O
production O
over O
what O
order O
he O
should O
deliver O
the O
food O
, O
as O
we O
all O
agreed O
the O
miso O
should O
be O
eaten O
with O
the O
sushi B-AS
to O
aid O
digestion O
. O

The O
kitchen O
turns O
out O
a O
long O
list B-AS
of O
American B-AS
bar I-AS
food I-AS
staples I-AS
, O
like O
burgers B-AS
and O
fries B-AS
. O

When O
we O
went O
to O
dinner B-AS
here O
, O
the O
place B-AS
was O
empty O
, O
which O
should O
have O
been O
a O
clue O
. O

Went O
to O
celebrate O
my O
sisters O
birthday O
on O
9 O

11 O

back O
on O
the O
waiters B-AS
rude O
answering O
of O
a O
question O
we O
had O
about O
the O
menu B-AS

The O
food B-AS
is O
pretty O
good O
, O
but O
after O
2 O
or O
3 O
bad O
experiences O
at O
the O
restaurant O
( O
consistently O
rude O
, O
late O
with O
RSVP O

I O
decided O
I O
would O
only O
order O

The O

with O

Bernard O
is O
a O
great O
host B-AS
; O
it O
didn O
' O
t O
bother O
me O
a O
bit O
that O
he O
recited O
the O
entire O
menu B-AS
to O
my O
wife O
. O

' O
When O
I O
called O
the O
waitress B-AS
on O
it O
, O
she O
said O
that O
they O
simply O
couldn O
' O
t O
serve O
tap O
water B-AS
. O

Telly O
' O
s O
has O
the O
best O
octopus O
ever O
and O
the O
fish B-AS
was O
so O
good O
on O
the O
grill B-AS
. O

Especially O
the O
manager B-AS
or O
host B-AS
who O
kept O
walking O
by O
and O
giving O
us O
the O
evil O
eye O
to O
see O
the O
progress O
of O
our O
dinner B-AS
so O
they O
could O
turn O
the O
table O
over O
to O
other O
customers O
. O

the O
salad B-AS
was O
good O
but O
my O
friends O
hardly O
ate O
their O
pasta B-AS

The O

We O
went O
for O
Buffet B-AS
lunch I-AS
and O
the O
sauce B-AS
was O
water O
down O
, O
not O
at O
all O
spicy O

plus O

and O
a O
very O
deserved O
tip B-AS
. O

Of O
course O
we O
went O
there O
with O
a O
large O
party O
and O
had O
to O
wait O
a O
bit O
to O
get O
seated O
( O
even O
with O
reservations B-AS
) O
, O
but O
we O
had O
all O
our O
dishes B-AS
served I-AS
at O
the O
same O
time O
and O
promptly O
. O

We O
hunted O
the O
waitress B-AS
to O
at O
least O
pay O
for O
the O
drinks B-AS
. O

Otherwise O
, O
you O
can O
eat O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
( O
It O
was O
Saturday O
afternoon O
and O
the O
place B-AS
was O
empty O
) O
. O

The O
not O
so O
goods O
: O
very O
pricey O
appetizers B-AS
- O
$ O
12 O
for O
a O
half O
cup B-AS
of I-AS
fried I-AS
clams I-AS
, O
$ O

for O
two O
corn O
on O
the O
cob O
and O
$ O
6 O
for O
a O
small O
plate O
of O
fries O
. O

I O
ordered O
the O
fried B-AS
catfish I-AS
, O
which O
had O
very O
little O
to O
no O
seasoning B-AS
, O
the O
yams B-AS
, O
and O
mac B-AS
and I-AS
cheese I-AS
which O
were O
just O
okay O
. O

When O
the O
manager B-AS
came O
to O
our O
table B-AS
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
meal O
and O
asked O
how O
our O
experience O
was O
, O
I O
complained O
to O
him O
about O
the O
cold B-AS
. O

The O
only O
redeeming O
factor O
of O
the O
night O
was O
the O
dessert B-AS
which O
was O
very O
good O
but O
certainly O
not O
worth O
the O
cost B-AS
of O
an O
overall O
horible O
experience O
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
knew O
about O
every O
item O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
and O
explained O
it O
very O
well O
. O

Our O
waiter B-AS
seemed O
to O
really O
care O
about O
getting O
us O
to O

the O
peanut B-AS
sauce I-AS
came O
in O
a O
tiny O
plastic O
cup O
smaller O
than O
a O
shot O
glass B-AS
. O

Ten O
minutes O
later O
the O
manager B-AS
relented O
and O
dropped O
off O
a O
glass B-AS
of I-AS
water I-AS
with O
an O
upturned O
nose O
. O

While O
the O
staff B-AS
was O
kind O
and O
attentive O
, O
our O
waiter B-AS
never O
once O
broke O
a O
smile O
, O
even O
when O
I O
told O
him O
it O
was O
my O
friend O
' O
s O
birthday O
, O
although O
he O
did O
bring O
a O
dessert B-AS
with O
a O
candle B-AS
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
meal B-AS
. O

They O
each O
included O

, O
miso O
soup O
, O
a O
california B-AS
roll I-AS
, O
and O
a O
whole O
plate O
of O
food B-AS
. O

I O
planned O
a O
holiday B-AS
dinner I-AS
at O
Kurio O
and O
we O
ended O
up O
waiting B-AS
two O
hours O
for O
the O
appetizers B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
barely O
decent O
and O
our O
server B-AS
was O
nowhere O
to O
be O
found O
. O

They O

) O
, O
great O
cheese B-AS
, O
sauce B-AS
isn O
' O
t O
too O
sugary O
. O

We O
were O
however O
seated O
right O
away O
and O
was O
immediately O
told O
by O
our O
waiter B-AS
that O
they O
were O
out O
of O
sparking O
mineral O
water B-AS
. O

The O
third O
time O
, O
after O
, O
an O
hour O
and O
a O
half O
of O
waiting B-AS
, O
my O
friend O
went O
up O
to O
the O
host B-AS
to O
check O
the O

and O
on O
weekends O
a O
DJ B-AS
fills O
the O
dining O
room O
with O
loud O
dance B-AS
beats I-AS
. O

We O
had O
to O
flag O
the O
waitress B-AS
down O
to O
get O
a O
drink B-AS
refill O
and O
waited O
an O
extrodinarily O
long O
time O
for O
our O
entrees B-AS
. O

For O
dessert B-AS
, O
go O
with O
the O
delicate O
, O
subtle O
flan B-AS
over O
the O
pasty O
rice B-AS
pudding I-AS
. O

Maybe O
I O
' O
ve O
just O
gotten O
lucky O
with O
seating B-AS
, O
but O
I O
' O
ve O
never O
had O
more O
than O
a O
ten O
minute O
wait B-AS
. O

So O
are O
cooked O

Marinated B-AS

After O
all O
that O
, O
the O
waiter B-AS
tried O
to O
backpedal O
saying O
its O
too O
hard O
to O
time O
the O
cooking B-AS
of I-AS
miso I-AS

with O
the O

. O

Start O
by O
enjoying O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
while O
having O
a O
glass O
of O
wine O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
and O
we O
you O
are O
ready O
, O
go O
and O
enjoy O
your O
food O
! O

You O
' O

time O
! O

We O
ordered O
whole O
wheast O
toast O
; O
the O
waiter B-AS
didn O
' O
t O
bring O
it O
until O
15 O
minutes O
after O
we O
had O
received O
our O
brunch B-AS
. O

In O
retrospect O
, O
that O
was O
kind O
of O
foolish O
, O
as O
the O
portions B-AS
for O
dinner B-AS
were O
obscene O
. O

The O
mango B-AS
salsa I-AS
with I-AS
fish I-AS
cake I-AS
was O
too O
sour O
, O
the O
apple B-AS
suace I-AS
for O
pork B-AS
chop I-AS
too O
sweet O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
rather O
slow O
but O
our O
waiter B-AS
was O
very O
pleasant O
and O
obliging O
. O

If O
you O
don O
' O
t O
mind O
interacting O
with O
sour O
- O
puss O
employees B-AS
, O
then O
by O
all O
means O
, O
enjoy O
the O
treats B-AS
at O
Sweet O
Melissa O
. O

But O
if O
you O
want O
cheap O
eggs B-AS
, O
omelets O
, O
pancakes B-AS
or O
French B-AS
Toast I-AS
, O
with O
all O
the O
trimmings O
plus O
good O
coffee B-AS
, O
fast O
and O
straight O
- O
up O
, O
this O
is O
the O
place O
if O
you O
live O
in O
Park O
Slope O
. O

The O
open B-AS
- I-AS
faced I-AS
sandwich I-AS
I O
tried O
had O
fluffy O
scrambled B-AS
eggs I-AS
and O
the O
silkiest O
smoked O
salmon O
I O
' O
ve O
ever O
had O
, O
and O
I O
' O
ve O
eated O
a O
lot O
of O
lox B-AS
over O
the O
years O
! O

While O
the O
service B-AS
and O
setting B-AS
were O
average O
, O
the O
food B-AS
was O
excellent O
. O

We O
were O
so O
excited O
since O
I O
was O
reading O
great O
review O
of O
this O
place B-AS
, O
however O
we O
were O
disappointed O
with O
the O
taste B-AS
of O
the O
food B-AS
. O

So O
we O
showed O
up O
with O
our O
reservations B-AS
and O
even O
though O
the O
place B-AS
stayed O
pretty O
empty O
throughout O
the O
night O
, O
they O
seated O
us O
right O
next O
to O
the O
swinging O
kitchen O
doors O
. O

Also O
, O
overheard O
gent O
at O
the O
next O
table B-AS
complaining O
to O
the O
manager B-AS
about O
his O
food B-AS
. O

At O
1 O
: O
15 O
we O
were O
still O
waiting B-AS
for O
our O
plates B-AS
! O

We O
sat O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
and O
were O
constantly O
bumped O
by O
the O
waitress B-AS
flying O
past O
; O
had O
fabulously O
fresh O
raw O
oysters O
with O
pieces O
of O
shell O
in O
every O
bite O
; O
lobsters O
rolls B-AS
were O
tasty O
but O
the O
large O
pieces O
of O
meat O
were O
tough O
; O
the O
apple O
crumble O
was O
excellent O
but O
the O
ice B-AS
cream I-AS
was O
over O
- O
frozen O
and O
the O
stench O
of O
frying O
oil O
was O
nearly O
unbearable O
. O

Half O
the O
menu B-AS
is O
comprised O
of O
original O
creations O
while O
the O
other O
half O
consists O
of O
unique O
slants O
on O
orthodox O
cuisine O
such O
as O
the O
single O
super O
- O
sized O
gnocchi B-AS
with O
cinammon O
. O

For O
Manhattanites O
like O
us O
that O
are O
used O
to O
pretentious O
attitudes B-AS
and O
expensive O
tabs O
, O
this O
place O
is O
definitely O
a O
nice O
change O
from O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
meatpacking O
district B-AS
. O

The O
pancakes O
were O
good O
, O
but O
don O
' O
t O
have O
blueberry B-AS
pancakes I-AS
on O
the O
menu B-AS
of O
you O
are O
not O
able O
to O
produce O
more O
than O
three O
tiny O
blueberries O
in O
each O
pancake O
. O

I O
had O
reservations B-AS
for O
9 O
: O
30pm O
and O
after O
waiting B-AS
more O
that O
50 O
mins O
and O
bunch O
of O
lies O
that O
you O
' O
re O
next O
. O

Otoro B-AS
tuna I-AS

sashimi B-AS
, O
topped O
by O
the O
chef B-AS
with O
a O

and O
a O
barely O

pleasure B-AS
. O

Dropped O
in O
for O
a O
quick O
bite O
with O
a O
friend O
- O
- O
like O
the O
previous O
reviewer O
it O
took O
more O
than O
15 O
minutes O
for O
any O
kind O
of O
service B-AS
at O
all O
( O
including O
getting O
water B-AS
) O
and O
then O
another O
45 O
minutes O
to O
get O
a O
burger O
( O
which O
admittedly O
was O
good O
) O
. O

Great O
pizza B-AS
for O
lunch B-AS
place O
. O

seems O
everyone O
ordered O
sushi B-AS
there O
were O
tons O
of O
delivery B-AS
orders O
( O
we O
can O
tell O
as O
we O
sat O
near O
the O
back O
) O
. O

Arrive O
at O
7 O
: O
00pm O
, O
the O
waiters B-AS
didn O
' O
t O
give O
us O
our O
menus B-AS
till O
an O
1 O
1 O
/ O
2 O
hour O
later O
. O

The O
round B-AS
pizza I-AS
doesn O
' O
t O
taste O
as O
good O
as O
I O
recall O
, O
it O
' O
s O
still O
wonderful O
, O
but O
the O
Sicilian B-AS
is O
to O
die O
for O
. O

I O
' O
m O
also O
a O
big O
fan O
of O
the O
chicken O
pizza O
on O
their O
new B-AS
bar I-AS
menu I-AS
( O
no O
bread B-AS
- O
weird O
, O
huh O
? O

Start O
with O
fennel B-AS
- I-AS
fragrant I-AS
grilled I-AS
sardines I-AS
and O
the O
extraordinary O
pastas B-AS
, O
such O
as O
poppy O
- O
seeded O
sweet B-AS
beet I-AS
ravioli I-AS
, O
brown B-AS
- I-AS
butter I-AS
- I-AS
slicked I-AS

swiss B-AS
chard I-AS
- I-AS
ricotta I-AS
malfatti O
( O
misshapen O
gnocchi O
with O
fried O
sage O
) O
. O

Although O
I O
didn O
' O
t O
pay O
for O
the O
meal O
( O
and O
it O
' O
s O
about O
$ O
22 O
bucks O
a O
plate O
, O
way O
over O
my O
normal O
eating O
range B-AS
) O
, O
I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
it O
was O
better O
than O
any O
food B-AS
I O
' O
ve O
ever O
had O
in O
little O
Italy O
, O
and O
there O
weren O
' O
t O
any O
touristy O
elements O
to O
be O
found O
. O

But O
servers B-AS
, O
attentive O
if O
slightly O
unpolished O
, O
gladly O
direct O
inquisitors O
to O
menu B-AS
strengths O
- O
- O
like O
rum O
- O
flambeed O
dessert O
bananas O
foster O
- O
- O
and O
allow O
leisurely O
enjoyment O
. O

I O
' O
m O
totally O
into O
the O
space O
- O
age O
vibe B-AS
of O
this O
place O
, O
but O
I O
wish O
they O
had O
more O
tables B-AS
to O
sit O
down O
at O
. O

Ask O
for O
a O
table O
closer O
to O
the O
bar B-AS
than O
in O
back O
of O
the O
dining O
area O
; O
the O
drop B-AS
ceiling I-AS
the O
back O
compromises O
enjoying O
the O
soaring O
space B-AS
of O
Guastavino O
' O
s O
. O

When O
we O
got O
our O
bill B-AS
the O
drinks B-AS
were O
full O
priced O
and O
when O
we O
asked O
, O
our O
waitress B-AS
said O
that O
there O
is O
no O
happy O
hour O
on O
the O
roof O
. O

The O
hostess B-AS
was O
condescending O
and O
the O
waiter B-AS
was O
somewhat O
absent O
and O
unaccomodating O
( O
sure O
, O
we O
made O
a O
reservation B-AS
to O
sit O
outside O
but O
when O
I O
asked O
to O
be O
moved O
indoors O
after O
I O
heard O
thunder O
he O
didn O
' O
t O
even O
try O
to O
make O
it O
happen O
, O
giving O
me O
a O
blank O
stare O
and O
a O
shrug O
when O
I O
asked O
what O
we O
would O
do O
if O
it O
rained O
) O
. O

The O
server B-AS
was O
so O
busy O
the O
night O
we O
visited O
that O
she O
forgot O
to O
put O
in O
our O
food B-AS
order O
. O

The O
Food B-AS
The O
versatile B-AS
Austrian O
menu B-AS
, O
fused O
with O
French B-AS
and O
American O
, O
rewards O
both O
high O
and O
low O
- O
end O
appetites O
: O
rich O
, O
cheese O
- O
laden O
onion B-AS
soup I-AS
, O
grilled O
Gruyere O
and O
country B-AS
ham I-AS
sandwiches I-AS
and O
big O
- O
bunned O
burgers O
are O
as O
satisfying O
as O
velvety O

terrine I-AS
with O
kumquat B-AS
- I-AS
cranberry I-AS
compote O
, O
speck B-AS
and O
sausage B-AS
charcuterie O
and O
inexpensive O
cheese B-AS
plates I-AS
. O

There O
are O
no O
price B-AS
listed O
in O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
and O
she O
will O
not O
provid O
them O
with O
a O
smile O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
served B-AS
promptly O
and O
was O
really O
hot O
. O

The O
Food B-AS
This O
isn O
' O
t O
for O
those O
on O
a O
budget O
, O
but O
portions B-AS
are O
generous O
. O

When O
I O
couldn O
' O
t O
hear O
any O
of O
my O
selections O
in O
the O
dining B-AS
room I-AS
, O
the O
manager B-AS
told O
me O
that O
the O
broken O
speakers O
in O
were O
' O
not O
his O
fault O
' O

Candles B-AS
on O
the O
tables O
, O
cozy O
furnishings B-AS
and O
music B-AS
at O
just O
the O
right O
level O
make O
it O
a O
great O
dining O
experience B-AS
. O

I O
always O
find O
myself O
asking O
the O
waiter B-AS
to O
make O
something O
bland O
and O
different O
than O
what O
is O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
. O

My O
only O
complaint O
was O
that O
when O
I O
tried O
to O
go O
back O
with O
some O
friends O
on O
a O
crowded O
night O
, O
the O
place B-AS
was O
packed O
, O
yet O
they O
told O
us O
there O
was O
a O
20 O
minute O
wait O
and O
that O
we O
should O
wait O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
. O

The O
wait B-AS
for O
a O
table B-AS
is O
interminable O
. O

Great O
value O
for O
the O
price B-AS
- O
- O
lunch B-AS
is O
an O
even O
better O
value O
, O
with O
entree O
and O
appetizer B-AS
for O
between O
$ O
8 O
- O
10 O
or O
so O
. O

Having O
eaten O
here O
for O
lunch B-AS
many O
times O
, O
I O
can O
definitely O
vouch O
this O
place O
for O
having O
some O
of O
the O
best O
per B-AS
- I-AS
slice I-AS
Pizza I-AS
in O
the O
city O
. O

The O
food B-AS
and O
service B-AS
was O
top O
notch O
, O
only O
the O
complain O
is O
that O
this O
place O
is O
so O
small O
that O
some O
seats B-AS
are O
not O
made O
for O
a O
big O
guy B-AS
. O

went O
there O
for O
sunday O
brunch B-AS
after O
a O
wonderful O
massage O
- O
the O
food B-AS
was O
terrible O
- O
bland O
/ O
tasteless O
, O
cold O
, O
expensive O
. O

Our O
waitress B-AS
did O
not O
take O
our O
drink B-AS
order O
until O
I O
finally O
flagged O
her O
down O
and O
even O
then O
she O
seemed O
disinterested O
in O
our O
meal B-AS
. O

wait B-AS
staff I-AS
have O
no O
room O
to O
get O
to O
tables O
because O
of O
overflow O
from O
bar B-AS
area I-AS
, O
and O
knocked O
into O
the O
back O
seats O
of O
our O
table O
constantly O
. O

The O
concoction B-AS
was O
thrown O
away O
a O
mere O
two O
blocks O
from O
the O
Bar B-AS
. O

Had O
the O
calamari B-AS
app I-AS
, O
which O
TGIFriday O
' O
s O
makes O
better O
, O
and O
the O
scallop B-AS
ceviche I-AS
- O
that O
is O
NOT O
ceviche O
! O

the O
decor B-AS
could O
be O
a O
bit O
better O
, O
and O
if O
there O
was O
a O
small O
bar B-AS
the O
overall O
atmosphere B-AS
would O
be O
a O
bit O
more O
inviting O
( O
especially O
for O
regulars O
) O
. O

Maybe O
it O
was O
the O
choices O
the O
chefs O
had O
put O
on O
the O
Restaurant O
Week O
Menu B-AS
, O
but O
much O
of O
our O
food B-AS
was O
just O
so O
- O
so O
. O

I O
love O
the O
shrimp B-AS
summer I-AS
role I-AS
, O
chicken O
kabob O
' O
s O
, O
and O
all O
the O
chicken O
and O
shrimp B-AS
dishes I-AS
. O

i O
got O
a O
steak B-AS
special I-AS
that O
was O
way O
overpriced O
( O
$ O
12 O
more O
then O
the O
steak O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
and O
no O
warning O
from O
the O
waitress B-AS
) O
and O
it O
was O
cooked O
to O
the O
wrong O
temperature B-AS
. O

If O
people O
are O
late O
, O
you O
could O
lose O
your O
reservation B-AS
and O
/ O
or O
the O
staff B-AS
does O
pressure O
you O
to O
start O
ordering O
even O
if O
your O
whole O
party O
hasnt O
arrived O
. O

People O
will O
literally O
spend O
their O
entire O
lunch B-AS
break O
waiting B-AS
and O
for O
what O
- O
an O
average O
fastfood O
burger B-AS
. O

If O
you O
like O
an O
ecclectic O
crowd O
and O
an O
overall O
good O
time B-AS
where O
you O
and O
your O
friends O
can O
get O
together O
whether O
it O
be O
to O
eat O
, O
drink B-AS
or O
just O
play O
some O
good O
old O
pictionary O
( O
they O
provide O
crayons O
and O
a O
blank O
white O
sheet B-AS
at O
every O
table O
) O
, O
go O
to O
the O
Cargo O
! O

Now O
a O
sleek O
, O
cool O
lounge B-AS
with O
refreshing O
new B-AS
color I-AS
, O
lighting O
and O
surfaces O
, O
Fig O
27 O
mirrors B-AS
its O
around O
the O
corner O
sibling O
, O
PS450 O
with O
a O
yummy O
menu B-AS
of O
small O
bites O
, O
great O
drinks B-AS
and O
wonderful O
staff B-AS
. O

We O
would O
rather O
pay O
more O
prices B-AS
and O
expect O
the O
better O
food B-AS
and O
service O
. O

We O
finally O
flagged O
down O
another O
server B-AS
who O
brought O
us O
more O
to O
drink B-AS
, O
and O
then O
they O
took O
forever O
with O
the O
check O
. O

When O
we O
asked O
a O
waiter B-AS
for O
an O
explanation O
of O
the O
long O
wait O
with O
some O
many O
empty O
tables B-AS
he O
had O
no O
answer O
so O
we O
asked O
for O
the O
manager B-AS
. O

went O
here O
late O
night O
after O
a O
a O
few O
drinks B-AS
at O
my O
favorite O
watering O
spot B-AS
and O
was O
amazed O
that O
a O
place O
which O
serves O
food O
till O
4 O
can O
be O
so O
damned O
good O
. O

Although O
she O
was O
obviously O
busy O
, O
she O
was O
helpful O
in O
describing O
certain O
items O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
and O
suggested O
a O
duck B-AS
dish I-AS
that O
was O
out O
of O
this O
world O
. O

THe O
bartendars B-AS
were O
right O
on O
top O
of O
getting O
us O
our O
wine B-AS
and O
setting O
up O
free O
blue O
cheese O
dip O
and O
chips O
for O
us O
. O

The O
lunch B-AS
got O
a O
little O
bizarre O
when O
we O
asked O
the O
waiter B-AS
how O
the O
joint O
got O
it O
' O
s O
name O
, O
and O
he O
made O
his O
hands O
into O
cups O
in O
reference O
to O
placing O
them O
on O
a O
woman O
' O
s O
breasts O
and O
said O
, O
No O
, O
not O
this O
. O

The O
waitstaff B-AS
are O
surprisingly O
uninformed O
and O
unintelligent O
, O
and O
I O
say O
this O
even O
though O
I O
liked O
my O
waiter B-AS
. O

Right O
after O
we O
finished O
the O
main O
course O
( O
the O
organic B-AS
chicken I-AS
was O
dry O
) O
, O
but O
before O
we O
finish O
drinking O
the O
wine B-AS
the O
check O
was O
placed O
on O
the O
table O
, O
and O
the O
waitress B-AS
came O
back O
and O
picked O
it O
up O
three O
times O
. O

The O
outdoor B-AS
patio I-AS
is O
really O
nice O
in O
good O
weather O
, O
but O
what O
ambience B-AS
the O
indoors O
possesses O
is O
negated O
by O
the O
noise O
and O
the O
crowds O
. O

The O
Food B-AS
There O
' O
s O
a O
trimmed O
- O
down O
version O
of O
the O
regular O
Blue B-AS
Ribbon I-AS
menu I-AS
- O
- O
all O
manner O
of O
sandwiches B-AS
, O
and O
a O
solid O
selection O
of O
American O
main O
courses O
- O
- O
but O
the O
real O
attraction O
is O
the O
vast O
, O
well O
- O
edited O
range B-AS
of I-AS
cheese I-AS
, O
fish O
and O
vegetable B-AS
portions I-AS
( O
goodies O
like O
foie O
gras O
terrine O
aside O
, O
the O
meat O
selections O
are O
disappointingly O
indistinct O
) O
. O

Most O
of O
the O
food B-AS
has O
a O
vinegary O
flavor B-AS
( O
I O
think O
because O
of O
the O
injera O
) O
. O

It O
does O
get O
crowded O
with O
plenty O
of O
blue B-AS
shirted I-AS
cigar I-AS
smoking O
wannabes O
, O
so O
make O
a O
reservation B-AS
. O

My O
bass B-AS
was O
even O
worse O
- O
smothered O
in O
some O
kind O
of O
tomato B-AS
sauce I-AS
that O
just O
did O
not O
go O
with O
fish B-AS
and O
the O
spinach B-AS
that O
accompanied O
the O
dish B-AS
was O
extremely O
dry O
and O
flavorless O
. O

service B-AS
was O
attentive O
at O
the O
beginning O
but O
the O
waiter B-AS
lost O
us O
towards O
the O
end O
and O
we O
had O
to O
flag O
them O
down O
for O
the O
check O
. O

For O
the O
price B-AS
( O
$ O
8 O
) O
, O
the O
quality B-AS
of I-AS
the I-AS
buffet I-AS
is O
great O
! O

Last O
, O
but O
not O
least O
, O
when O
we O
walked O
in O
, O
most O
of O
the O
clientelle B-AS
was O
Vietnamese O
and O
next O
to O
us O
was O
a O
food B-AS
critic O
whose O
review O
was O
on O
the O
back O
of O
the O
menu B-AS
. O

The O
bottom O
line O
is O
that O
Mercadito O
is O
All O
style O
and O
No O
substance O
( O
the O
drinks B-AS
had O
far O
too O
much O
salad B-AS
and O
seasoning B-AS
in O
them O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
was O
warm O
, O
sexy O
, O
and O
very O
romantic O
but O
the O
lighting B-AS
wasn O
' O
t O
good O
for O
reading O
the O
menu B-AS
. O

After O
reading O
the O
negative O
sushi B-AS
reviews O
, O
my O
boyfriend O
and O
I O
opted O
for O
their O
Korean B-AS
fare I-AS
. O

With O
all O
of O
the O
kitchen O
goof O
- O
ups O
( O
appetizer B-AS
coming O
out O
before O
the O
entree O
and O
one O
entree O
coming O
out O
ten O
minutes O
before O
the O
other O
) O
you O
would O
think O
that O
the O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
would O
have O
been O
more O
attentive O
. O

One O
Entree B-AS
from O
their O
restaraunt O
is O
enough O
to O
fill O
two O
adults O
, O
not O
to O
mention O
that O
all O
their O
dishes B-AS
are O
out O
of O
this O
world O
. O

When O
I O
asked O
the O
waitress B-AS
, O
she O
told O
me O
they O
couldn O
' O
t O
afford O
the O
salmon B-AS
, O
and O
had O
changed O
the O
dish B-AS
( O
though O
not O
on O
the O
menu O
) O
. O

I O
had O
reservations B-AS
for O
a O
week O
but O
was O
seated O
at O
the O
worst O
table B-AS
in I-AS
the I-AS
room I-AS
, O
against O
a O
wall O
near O
the O
entrance O
to O
the O
kitchen O
, O
very O
claustaphobic O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
a O
mix B-AS
of I-AS
sandwiches I-AS
, O
salads B-AS
and O
appetizers B-AS
that O
were O
mostly O
healthy O
and O
had O
a O
nice O
Brazilian O
touch O
. O

My O
vegetable B-AS
Napoleon I-AS
was O
good O
; O
although O
i O
first O
got O
the O
veggie B-AS
burger I-AS
because O
the O
waitress O
mis O
- O
heard O
and O
stood O
my O
friend O
up O
for O
another O
15 O
minutes O
of O
waiting B-AS
to O
have O
it O
served O
. O

If O
you O
' O
re O
going O
to O
label O
spicy O
items O
on O
your O
menu B-AS
as O
spicy O
( O
like O
the O
Buffalo O
and O
Cajun B-AS
wraps I-AS
) O
, O
I O
think O
you O
should O
go O
ahead O
and O
label O
all O
the O
spicy O
items O
as O
spicy O
. O

The O
waitress B-AS
took O
our O
menu B-AS
away O
, O
without O
taking O
our O
food B-AS
order O
! O

Great O
for O
those O
hungover O
mornings O
when O
you O
need O
a O
decent O
pint O
and O
delicious O
, O
homemade B-AS
food I-AS
that O
will O
tide O
you O
over O
for O
the O
whole O
day B-AS
. O

Into O
our O
appetizer B-AS
, O
an O
adjacent O
table O
became O
available O
, O
and O
we O
asked O
if O
we O
could O
use O
it O
, O
but O
the O
waiter B-AS
said O
it O
most O
likely O
was O
being O
used O
. O

To O
make O
matters O
worse O
an O
hour O
into O
our O
dinner B-AS
we O
see O
a O
waiter B-AS
take O
mojitos B-AS
to O
another O
table O
. O

we O
had O
dinner B-AS
at O
becco O
on O
a O
friday O
night O
, O
and O
were O
seated O
in O
the O
left O
bar O
area O
, O
which O
while O
pretty O
crowded O
, O
had O
a O
manageable O
noise B-AS
level I-AS
. O

The O
huge O
terrace B-AS
is O
just O
so O
beautiful O
- O
- O
and O
rumor O
has O
it O
they O
' O
ll O
be O
tenting O
the O
space B-AS
this O
fall O
, O
so O
we O
midtowners O
can O
continue O
to O
dine O
outside O
through O
the O
end O
of O
the O
year O
. O

about O
10 O
minutes O
apart O
each O
, O
so O
we O
were O
all O
eating O
cold O
eggs B-AS
by O
the O
time O
we O
got O
our O
food B-AS
. O

After O
demanding O
a O
free O
round O
of O
drinks B-AS
from O
a O
third O
manager B-AS
, O
our O
party O
decided O
to O
bail O
on O
this O
horrific O
french O
import O
. O

Been O
there O
a O
few O
times O
for O
dinner B-AS
, O
brunch O
or O
just O
a O
drink B-AS
( O
the O
French B-AS
cosmos I-AS
are O
fantastic O
) O
and O
it O
just O
keeps O
getting O
better O
. O

Steak O
- O
Porterhouse O
for O
2 O
was O
served O
for O
1 O
, O
overspiced O
, O
overpriced O
and O
tasted O
frozen O
, O
with O
a O
hint O
of O
msg B-AS
Dessert I-AS
- O
best O
part O
of O
meal O
, O
good O
espresso O
Overall O
- O
if O
food B-AS
quality I-AS
matters O
to O
you O
over O
pretty O
lights O
and O
models O
handing O
you O
towels O
in O
the O
bathroom O
, O
i O
don O
' O
t O
recommend O
. O

They O
served O
the O
salad B-AS
and O
the O
main B-AS
course I-AS
together O
and O
didn O
' O
t O
even O
bring O
the O
dessert B-AS
menu I-AS
. O

This O
happened O
while O
many O
diners B-AS
were O
enjoying O
their O
meal B-AS
and O
it O
was O
rudes O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
good O
( O
and O
the O
$ O
25 O
prix B-AS
fixe I-AS
made O
it O
all O
that O
much O
better O
) O
, O
but O
the O
dinner O
started O
to O
feel O
like O
an O
assembly O
line O
when O
our O
appetizer B-AS
arrived O
5 O
minutes O
after O
ordering O
. O

We O
preferred O
to O
gaze O
at O
our O
burgers B-AS
while O
avoiding O
having O
to O
look O
at O
the O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
, O
but O
no O
complaints O
. O

Interesting O
crowd O
for O
people O
watching O
- O
old O
school O
Italian O
music B-AS
cranking O
- O
friendly O
Italian O
waitress B-AS
brought O
us O
our O
wine B-AS
garlic I-AS
bread I-AS
in O
no O
time O
. O

I O
didn O
' O
t O
even O
have O
time O
to O
finish O
my O
single O
cocktail B-AS
and O
the O
waiter B-AS
didn O
' O
t O
even O
ask O
if O
we O
wanted O
coffee B-AS
but O
instead O
, O
gave O
us O
our O
check O
without O
us O
even O
requesting O
it O
. O

All O
the O
food B-AS
was O
carefully O
prepared O
and O
the O
presentation B-AS
was O
a O
cut O
above O
. O

They O
have O
possibly O
the O
worst O
service B-AS
in O
New O
York O
I O
have O
waited O
until O
the O
waiter B-AS
has O
finished O
his O
paper O
, O
begged O
for O
water B-AS
and O
waited O
over O
an O
hour O
for O
my O
meal B-AS
. O

When O
my O
( O
pregnant O
) O
friend O
asked O
about O
a O
non O
- O
alcoholic O
version O
of O
a O
drink B-AS
, O
the O
answer B-AS
was O
simply O
no O
, O
with O
no O
further O
suggestions O
. O

i O
think O
friends O
coffee B-AS
shop O
makes O
great O
food O
the O
service B-AS
is O
great O
and O
they O
are O
very O
poilte O
i O
think O
that O
they O
should O
open O
more O
because O
there O
the O
best O
food O
store O
i O
ever O
ate O
from O
the O
food O
is O
addicting O
and O
you O
cant O
stop O
eating O
because O
it O
so O
delious O
. O

From O
beginning B-AS
appetizers I-AS
, O
the O
scallops B-AS
were O
incredible O
, O
to O
the O
delicious O
chocolate B-AS
souffle I-AS
with I-AS
rasberry I-AS
mint I-AS
sorbet I-AS
, O
we O
were O
delighted O
by O
the O
taste O
sensations O
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
didn O
' O
t O
know O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
didn O
' O
t O
bring O
more O
than O
one O
item O
at O
a O
time O
, O
and O
put O
some O
orders O
in O
twice O
with O
the O
kitchen B-AS
. O

deserts B-AS
were O
slow O
to O
order O
as O
waiters B-AS
passed O
us O
twice O
, O
even O
with O
the O
menus B-AS
closed I-AS
. O

They O
are O
negligent O
in O
alerting O
customers O
when O
an O
order O
is O
ready O
- O
you O
could O
end O
up O
waiting B-AS
for O
half O
an O
hour O
while O
your O
food B-AS
is O
sitting O
on O
their O
counter B-AS
getting O
cold O
. O

I O
was O
at O
Son O
Cubano O
a O
few O
months O
ago O
, O
and O
although O
i O
was O
only O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
( O
without O
prior O
reservations B-AS
which O
are O
a O
must O
) O
, O
i O
had O
an O
awesome O
time B-AS
. O

The O
busboys B-AS
were O
more O
helpful O
than O
my O
server B-AS
who O
then O
made O
me O
wait O
at O
the O
bar O
( O
very O
crowded O
with O
what O
appeared O
to O
be O
tasty O
margaritas O
) O
to O
pay O
the O
bartender B-AS
- O
what O
' O
s O
that O
about O
? O

There O
were O
a O
lot O
of O
scensters O
who O
couldnt O
afford O
dinner B-AS
hanging O
in O
the O
waiting B-AS
area I-AS
so O
we O
got O
bumped O
around O
a O
lot O
. O

Our O
food B-AS
took O
forever O
, O
the O
bartender B-AS
seemed O
more O
interested O
in O
refilling O
drinks B-AS
for O
the O
regulars O
and O
never O
even O
brought O
bread B-AS
or O
water O
, O
as O
requested O
. O

Renderings O
of O
mythical O
creatures O
festoon O
its O
walls O
, O
and O
heavily O
tattooed O
waitresses B-AS
pick O
up O
orders O
from O
the O
open B-AS
kitchen I-AS
and O
chat O
at O
the O
small O
bar B-AS
. O

The O
staff B-AS
even O
went O
out O
of O
their O
way O
to O
print O
up O
menus B-AS
without O
prices O
at O
my O
request O
, O
since O
the O
dinner B-AS
party O
was O
my O
treat O
. O

Despite O
reservations B-AS
, O
we O
ended O
up O
waiting B-AS
for O
1hr O
+ O

The O
mussels B-AS
marina I-AS
are O
a O
must O
for O
an O
appetizer B-AS
, O
although O
you O
can O
' O
t O
go O
wrong O
with O
the O
stuffed O
artichoke O
either O
. O

the O
waiter B-AS
didn O
' O
t O
recommen O
any O
special O
for O
the O
night O
, O
didn O
' O
t O
come O
back O
to O
the O
table B-AS
to O
check O
if O
everything O
is O
okay O
, O
didn O
' O
t O
even O
offer O
me O
the O
dessert B-AS
menu I-AS
at O
the O
end O
. O

The O
trick O
to O
the O
tomato B-AS
and I-AS
onions I-AS

for O
it O
light O
on O
the O
onions O

heavy O
on O
the O
tomatoes B-AS
, O
order O
steak O
for O
one O
less O
person O
than O
you O
have O
in O
your O
party O
and O
if O
the O
steak O
is O
too O
rare O
, O
you O
can O
cook O
the O
individual O
pieces O
more O
by O
placing O
them O
on O
the O
platter O
around O
the O
edges O
. O

My O
party O
felt O
like O
we O
got O
put O
in O
a O
dining B-AS
room I-AS
for O
tourist O
, O
which O
must O
have O
been O
the O
penalty O
box O
area O
for O
the O
disgruntled O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
on O
duty O
. O

then O
the O
manager B-AS
gave O
us O
lemon B-AS
juice I-AS
instead O
of O
ceasar B-AS
dressing I-AS
for O
a O
ceasar O
salad O
which O
ruined O
the O
salad O
. O

The O
Scene B-AS
You O
won O
' O
t O
blink O
twice O
at O
the O
restaurant O
' O
s O
spartan O
decor B-AS
: O
As O
the O
packed O
crowds O
and O
critics O
' O
praises O
wallpapering O
the O
front O
wall O
agree O
, O
this O
longtime O
local O
favorite O
is O
truly O
one O
of O
the O
area O
' O
s O
most O
exquisite O
finds O
. O

But O
on O
a O
recent O
Sunday O
brunch B-AS
excursion O
, O
I O
was O
greeted O
by O
a O
uniformly O
unfriendly O
staff O
- O
starting O
with O
the O
hostess B-AS
and O
extending O
to O
foul O
faced O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
. O

Our O
waiter B-AS
brought O
out O
three O
main B-AS
courses I-AS
, O
but O
the O
fourth O
wasn O
' O
t O
ready O
so O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
10 O
minutes O
for O
the O
last O
dish B-AS
to O
arrive O
, O
but O
they O
were O
very O
nice O
and O
gave O
us O
free O
red B-AS
pepper I-AS
hummus I-AS
while O
we O
waited O
. O

Had O
a O
mouthwatering O
sardinian B-AS
Stuffed I-AS
Squid I-AS
and O
a O
Catfish B-AS
fiumarola O
from O
Rome O
( O
think O
was O
capers O
and O
anchovies O
sauce B-AS
) O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
great O
- O
- O
my O
glass O
was O
refilled O
without O
having O
to O
ask O
, O
we O
were O
greeted O
by O
the O
manager B-AS
that O
day O
to O
ask O
how O
our O
food B-AS
was O
. O

got O
the O
guac B-AS
but O
no O
drinks B-AS
until O
it O
was O
all O
gone O
( O
approximately O
20 O
minutes O
later O
) O
. O

Although O
when O
I O
went O
to O
eat O
dinner B-AS
at O
Bombay O
Talkie O
on O
a O
crazy O
busy O
night O
, O
my O
waiter B-AS
was O
extremely O
helpful O
through O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
polite O
and O
polished O
. O

Zippier O
palates O
share O
sesame O
- O
fried O
lobster B-AS
spring I-AS
rolls I-AS
, O
shrimp B-AS
dumplings I-AS
with I-AS
citrus I-AS
soy I-AS
, O
and O
inventive O
maki O
, O
like O
the O
smoky B-AS
and O
sweet O
filet B-AS
mignon I-AS
- I-AS
pineapple I-AS
variety I-AS
. O

Towards O
the O
end O
of O
our O
meal B-AS
, O
a O
server B-AS
came O
out O
, O
apparently O
our O
orders O
had O
been O
double O
- O
filled O
. O

This O
place O
would O
be O
so O
much O
better O
served B-AS
by O
being O
run O
by O
a O
group O
that O
actually O
understands O
customer O
service B-AS
. O

Only O
thing O
we O
didn O
' O
t O
like O
was O
the O
steamed B-AS
chocolate I-AS
cake I-AS
with I-AS
mint I-AS
ice I-AS
creama O
group O
of O
the O
4 O
of O
us O
did O
not O
want O
to O
finish O
this O
dessert B-AS
! O

The O
situation O
was O
verified O
by O
taking O
3 O
dishes B-AS
that O
were O
over O
an O
hour O
late O
off O
the O
bill B-AS
and O
free O
desserts B-AS
and O
coffee O
but O
the O
experience O
left O
most O
of O
us O
never O
wanting O
to O
go O
to O
the O
supposed O
hip O
cool O
66 O
ever O
again O
. O

The O
perfect O
meal B-AS
; O
delux O
combo O
raw O
bar B-AS
as O
an O
appetizer O
, O
King B-AS
crab I-AS
as O
your O
entree O
. O

I O
went O
there O
about O
three O
times O
, O
one O
for O
dinner B-AS
on O
a O
sunday O
evening O
which O
is O
a O
salsa O
night O
after O
dinning O
, O
the O
service B-AS
was O
slow O
and O
a O
bit O
rude O
, O
the O
plates O
average O
some O
shrimp B-AS
octopus I-AS
and O
empanadas O
. O

If O
you O
don O
' O
t O
care O
about O
the O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
as O
long O
as O
they O
bring O
you O
your O
drinks B-AS
and O
dinner B-AS
, O
then O
go O
to O
Opa O
. O

Food O
was O
average O
, O
the O
appetizers B-AS
were O
better O
than O
the O
main B-AS
courses I-AS
. O

Sure O
the O
food B-AS
was O
- O
as O
always O
- O
very O
good O
, O
but O
we O
were O
quite O
outrageous O
about O
the O
waitress B-AS
. O

I O
go O
there O
to O
eat O
dinner B-AS
, O
brunch O
, O
or O
to O
just O
drink B-AS
and O
hang O
out O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
with O
the O
friendly O
staff B-AS
. O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
had O
dinner B-AS
here O
last O
week O
and O
the O
food B-AS
was O
very O
good O
. O

Bouley O
has O
done O
an O
excellent O
job O
creating O
this O
dining B-AS
establishment I-AS
with O
almost O
a O
museum O
sense O
, O
the O
artworks B-AS
on O
the O
wall O
have O
a O
very O
Klimty O
feeling O
and O
the O
gold B-AS
ceiling I-AS
completes O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
experience O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
polite O
, O
friendly O
and O
prompt O
, O
the O
characters O
walking O
around O
entertained O
the O
kids O
but O
werent O
intrusive O
to O
our O
meal B-AS
. O

Includes O
a O
diverse O
array O
of O
entrees B-AS
ranging O
from O
Boar O
( O
prepared O
in O
your O
choice O
of O
either O
the O
French O
or O
Asian O
tradition O
) O
, O
Mussels B-AS
, O
or O
Pad O
Thai O
that O
grace O
the O
menu B-AS
all O
at O
once O
, O
each O
one O
prepared O
in O
a O
distinctly O
different O
and O
delicate O
sauce O
. O

we O
live O
down O
the O
street O
and O
have O
eaten O
here O
many O
times O
for O
lunch B-AS
and O
dinner B-AS
, O
and O
the O
food B-AS
is O
consistently O
terrific O
. O

Service B-AS
has O
improved O
drastically O
from O
the O
old O
days O
, O
you O
are O
now O
seated O
by O
a O
hostess B-AS
instead O
of O
standing O
behind O
a O
nearby O
table O
waiting O
for O
them O
to O
finish O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
great O
, O
the O
chef B-AS
even O
gave O
me O
a O
complimentary O
dish B-AS
. O

We O
asked O
for O
bread O
plates O
when O
the O
bread O
was O
brought O
to O
the O
table B-AS
and O
the O
server B-AS
' O
s O
response O
was O
management B-AS
has O
decided O
not O
to O
offer O
bread O
plates O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
prompt O
, O
although O
at O
times O
the O
waiters O
seemed O
to O
be O
spending O
more O
time O
dealing O
with O
the O
overflow O
from O
the O
bar B-AS
than O
the O
diners B-AS
( O
ever O
heard O
of O
cocktail B-AS
waiters I-AS
) O
. O

the O
place O
has O
an O
awesome O
decore B-AS
, O
with O
fish B-AS
swiming O
below O
certain O
tables B-AS
. O

I O
had O
a O
9pm O
reservation O
and O
wound O
up O
sitting O
down O
closer O
to O
10 O
, O
but O
the O
bar B-AS
was O
entertaining O
enough O
for O
the O
almost O
- O
an O
- O
hour O
wait O
( O
excellent O
martinis B-AS
) O
. O

Lobster B-AS
ceviche I-AS
was O
amazing O
pared O
with O
mango B-AS
. O

The O
place O
was O
packed O
and O
while O
our O
food B-AS
took O
time O
to O
be O
prepared O
, O
our O
waiter B-AS
earned O
points O
for O
his O
sparkling O
conversation O
to O
pass O
time O
and O
for O
also O
knowing O
practically O
every O
ingredient O
of O
every O
special O
under O
consideration O
. O

Decor B-AS
is O
old O
, O
but O
the O
bathrooms B-AS
are O
clean O
and O
updated O
. O

Prices B-AS
are O
reasonable O
, O
probably O
$ O
55 O
/ O
pp O
with O
appetizers B-AS
, O
main B-AS
course I-AS
, O
dessert O
and O
a O
drink B-AS
. O

This O
was O
not O
the O
same O
hostess B-AS
I O
usually O
see O
there O
who O
happens O
to O
be O
very O
sweet O
and O
provides O
excellent O
service B-AS
. O

There O
is O
nothing O
else O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
except O
for O
exotic B-AS
teas I-AS
and O
cold O
beverages B-AS
, O
but O
with O
a O
meal B-AS
this O
cheap O
and O
delightful O
, O
who O
would O
care O
? O

The O
servers B-AS
were O
snobby O
and O
got O
mad O
at O
me O
when O
I O
asked O
if O
they O
serve O
by O
the O
slice B-AS
. O

I O
have O
reservations B-AS
about O
the O
all O
you O
can O
eat O
deal O
, O
however O
- O
- O
the O
choices B-AS
are O
fairly O
limited O
and O
you O
can O
probably O
order O
more O
food B-AS
than O
you O
can O
eat O
for O
less O
than O
$ O
18 O
by O
just O
going O
off O
the O
menu B-AS
. O

Try O
the O
olive B-AS
cream I-AS
cheese I-AS
or O
the O
lox B-AS
spread I-AS
on O
a O
whole O
wheat O
everything O
bagel B-AS
. O

Sometimes O
I O
grow O
a O
bit O
weary O
of O
dining B-AS
in O
those O
pretentious O
, O
haughty O
taughty O
, O
high O
fashion O
eateries B-AS
. O

The O
meat B-AS
was O
great O
, O
but O
vegetables B-AS
needed O
flavor O
and O
etc O
. O

However O
, O
if O
you O
want O
to O
, O
drink B-AS
and O
enjoy O
the O
pleasures B-AS
of O
food B-AS
, O
Sam O
' O
s O
is O
your O
new O
home O
away O
from O
home O

While O
they O
adhere O
to O
a O
certain O
traditionality O
in O
serving B-AS
their O
teas B-AS
; O
eg O
: O
samovar O
for O
the O
russian O
, O
chinese O
tea O
sets O
for O
the O
green O
, O
the O
food B-AS
labours O
under O
no O
such O
restrictions O
and O
there O
is O
nothing O
ordinary O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
. O

For O
a O
normal O
dinner B-AS
, O
I O
prefer O
a O
place O
that O
has O
a O
bit O
more O
room O
and O
that O
has O
a O
slightly O
more O
relaxed O
vibe B-AS
. O

Shun O
Lee O
has O
been O
serving O
creative O
Chinese B-AS
food I-AS
in O
a O
deluxe B-AS
dining I-AS
room I-AS
for O
30 O
years O
- O
- O
they O
must O
be O
doing O
something O
right O
! O

The O
smoked B-AS
salmon I-AS
appetizer I-AS
was O
pretty O
good O
( O
it O
comes O
with O
goat B-AS
cheese I-AS
, O
calpers O
and O
onions B-AS
) O
. O

The O
staff B-AS
was O
courteous O
and O
explained O
the O
menu O
with O
detail B-AS
. O

Reservations B-AS
are O
no O
guarantee O
of O
prompt O
seating O
, O
have O
a O
pre B-AS
- I-AS
game I-AS
drink I-AS
, O
pop O
a O
xanax O
and O
you O
can O
handle O
the O
drama O
of O
having O
a O
res O
and O
getting O
no O
love O
from O
the O
hostess B-AS
. O

Soy O
abounds O
, O
in O
all O
forms O
: O
as O
firm O
patties B-AS
, O
pure O
squares O
of O
glistening O
tofu B-AS
, O
and O
something O
called O
a O
hijiki O
patty O
- O
- O
mixed B-AS
tastily O
with O
shreds O
of O
seaweed O
, O
then O
fried O
. O

there O
' O
s O
always O
people O
waiting B-AS
to O
be O
seated O
and O
the O
chairs B-AS
are O
not O
comfortable O
. O

The O
host O
was O
playing O
god O
with O
his O
headset O
and O
reservation O
list O
, O
the O
bar B-AS
was O
packed O
with O
horney O
drunken O
investment O
bankers O
, O
reservations B-AS
are O
a O
joke O
and O
after O
haplessly O
sliding O
the O
plates O
at O
us O
when O
serving O
the O
food B-AS
, O
they O
couldn O
' O
t O
wait O
to O
collect O
the O
plates O
until O
we O
were O
done O
. O

Instead O
, O
Yasuda O
' O
s O
swarm O
of O
waiters O
and O
waitresses B-AS
hovered O
incessantly O
overhead O
, O
seizing O
any O
opportunity O
to O
fill O
a O
glass B-AS
, O
reorganize O
the O
table O
, O
ask O
if O
we O
were O
done O
, O
and O
of O
course O
clear O
us O
out O
of O
there O
in O
under O
80 O
min O
. O

I O
love O
Chinese B-AS
food I-AS
and O
have O
been O
looking O
for O
the O
alternative O
to O
the O
greasy O
stuff B-AS
on O
every O
corner O
of O
New O
York O
- O
ya O
, O
you O
know O
, O
the O
stinky O
take O
- O
out O
joints O
that O
leave O
you O
smelling O
like O
dinner B-AS
for O
100 O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
night O
! O

Our O
waitress B-AS
was O
a O
bit O
cold O
but O
she O
was O
still O
attentive O
and O
food B-AS
came O
quickly O
. O

One O
would O
think O
we O
' O
d O
get O
an O
apology O
or O
complimentary O
drinks B-AS
- O
instead O
, O
we O
got O
a O
snobby O
waiter B-AS
wouldn O
' O
t O
even O
take O
our O
order O
for O
15 O
minutes O
and O
gave O
us O
lip O
when O
we O
asked O
him O
to O
do O
so O
. O

The O
Food B-AS
The O
classic O
Italian B-AS
menu I-AS
gets O
off O
to O
a O
good O
start O
with O
Queen O
' O
s O
famous O
bread B-AS
basket O
, O
which O
is O
loaded O
with O
a O
slew O
of O
crunchy O
, O
yeasty O
homemade O
varieties B-AS
. O

That O
' O
s O
almost O
enough O
to O
prove O
its O
legitimacy O
to O
me O
, O
but O
eating O
there O
, O
both O
for O
a O
quick O
slice O
and O
sit O
- O
down O
for O
pasta B-AS
with O
my O
family B-AS
has O
always O
been O
a O
delicious O
, O
inexpensive O
and O
fun O
experience O
. O

Mac B-AS
cheese I-AS
is O
nothing O
to O
write O
home O
about O
; O
the O
beet B-AS
salad I-AS
is O
boring O
, O
mostly O
lettuce O
; O
tuna B-AS
sandwhich I-AS
- O
boring O
, O
mostly O
mayo O
; O
the O
french O
fries O
looked O
re O
- O
fried O
and O
were O
cold O
; O
the O
excellent O
pork O
sandwich O
came O
on O
one O
of O
those O
supermarket O
hot O
- O
dog O
buns O
. O

Ok O
I O
got O
the O
edamame B-AS
and O
something O
from O
the O
sushi B-AS
chef I-AS
for O
free O
, O
but O
the O
quality B-AS
of I-AS
food I-AS
is O
more O
important O
to O
me O
than O
a O
free O
small O
dish B-AS
( O
maybe O
that O
' O
s O
why O
the O
restaurant O
gives O
it O
to O
attact O
new O
customers O
. O

We O
were O
directed O
to O
a O
table B-AS
by O
a O
member O
of O
staff B-AS
, O
which O
we O
were O
then O
informed O
was O
reserved O
, O
and O
lost O
our O
seats B-AS
at O
the O
bar B-AS
, O
all O
this O
after O
spending O
upwards O
of O
$ O
30 O
each O
on O
very O
expensive O
drinks O
over O
a O
two O
- O
hour O
period O
. O

After O
our O
meal B-AS
, O
the O
manager B-AS
, O
even O
took O
some O
of O
his O
time O
to O
sit O
with O
us O
and O
give O
us O
a O
lesson O
in O
Sake O
101 O
. O

So O
if O
he O
can O
' O
t O
find O
fresh O
- O
good O
product O
, O
he O
' O
ll O
remove O
a O
dish B-AS
from O
the O
menu B-AS
which O
I O
think O
is O
fantastic O
. O

This O
much O
heralded O
restaurant O
brought O
my O
wife O
and O
I O
some O
excitement O
as O
we O
walked O
in O
the O
door B-AS
, O
but O
we O
were O
met O
with O
an O
awkward O
maitre B-AS
' O
d O
who O
barely O
spoke O
to O
us O
at O
all O
and O
just O
seemed O
standoff O
- O
ish O
. O

we O
were O
in O
haven O
from O
appetizers B-AS
, O
my O
favorite O
was O
the O
tuna B-AS
tartare I-AS
, O
to O
the O
dim B-AS
sum I-AS
, O
the O
best O
was O
shrimp B-AS
and O
foie B-AS
gras I-AS
dumpling I-AS
, O
and O
i O
could O
go O
on O
and O
on O
, O
everything O
was O
an O
explosion O
of O
flavors B-AS
. O

The O
prices B-AS
seemed O
reasonable O
with O
entrees B-AS
ranging O
from O
$ O
14 O
- O
$ O
25 O
. O

it O
would O
be O
better O
to O
place O
the O
bar B-AS
closer O
to O
the O
front B-AS
of O
the O
restaurant O
and O
away O
from O
the O
tables B-AS
. O

we O
wanted O
to O
join O
another O
2 O
top O
table B-AS
to O
ours O
and O
the O
manager B-AS
abruptly O
said O
, O
that O
won O
' O
t O
work O
for O
us O
! O

The O
only O
drawback O
was O
slow O
service B-AS
, O
but O
the O
food B-AS
and O
ambience B-AS
are O
so O
nice O
that O
your O
wait B-AS
is O
A O
) O
pleasant O
and O
B O
) O
worth O
it O
. O

I O
like O
the O
somosas B-AS
, O
chai B-AS
, O
and O
the O
chole B-AS
, O
but O
the O
dhosas B-AS
and O
dhal B-AS
were O
kinda O
dissapointing O
. O

Dinner B-AS
is O
okay O
- O
not O
many O
vegetarian O
options O
, O
and O
the O
portions B-AS
are O
small O
. O

Not O
a O
destination O
restaurant O
, O
but O
if O
you O
' O
re O
hungry O
for O
breakfast B-AS
or O
lunch O
, O
big O
portions B-AS
and O
good O
quality B-AS
for O
the O
money O
. O

Had O
a O
dinner O
date O
( O
her O
suggestion O
) O
: O
) O
Had O
the O
mussels B-AS
( O
really O
good O
) O
and O
smoked B-AS
salmon I-AS
( O
not O
the O
best O
) O
for O
appys B-AS
. O

In O
Short O
The O
vegi O
burgers O
( O
and O
the O
full B-AS
bar I-AS
) O
are O
the O
main O
draws O
: O
ranging O
from O
the O
Super O
Veg O
- O
Burger O
with O
lettuce O
, O
tomato B-AS
and O

. O

Our O
server B-AS
did O
not O
check O
on O
us O
, O
ask O
if O
we O
needed O
anything O
, O
refill O
our O
water B-AS
or O
get O
our O
dessert B-AS
order O
right O
. O

Between O
the O
seven O
of O
us O
we O
sampled O
just O
about O
everything O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
and O
nothing O
disappointed O
( O
ribs B-AS
pulled O
pork B-AS
seemed O
like O
the O
biggest O
hits O
) O
. O

However O
, O
when O
our O
waitress B-AS
realized O
her O
faux O
pas O
, O
an O
extra O
glass B-AS
of I-AS
wine I-AS
was O
sent O
to O
our O
table B-AS
and O
all O
was O
forgiven O
. O

The O

Though O
the O

be O
enough O

The O

' O

bad O
though O
- O
dinner B-AS
ended O
up O
at O
$ O

with O

we O
had O
a O

while O
they O
forgot O
to O
give O
us O
the O
cold O
appetizers O
, O
the O
waiter B-AS
and O
maitre B-AS
' O
d O
more O
than O
made O
up O
for O
it O
by O
being O
most O
accomodating O
to O
us O
. O

The O
Clinton O
- O
frequented O
restaurant O
stands O
handsomely O
on O
a O
quiet O
residential O
corner O
, O
and O
the O
modern O
interior B-AS
includes O
a O
long O
dining O
room O
, O
a O
small O
bar B-AS
and O
harsh O
lighting O
. O

The O
staff B-AS
were O
rude O
and O
rushed O
us O
through O
our O
meal B-AS
, O
clearing O
plates B-AS
and O
laying O
down O
dessert O
menus O
while O
others O
were O
still O
eating O
their O
main B-AS
courses I-AS
. O

Our O
waiter B-AS
was O
a O
little O
stressed O
and O
brought O
a O
couple O
things O
out O
late O
and O
as O
a O
result O
, O
he O
apologized O
graciously O
and O
gave O
us O
wine B-AS
on O
the O
house O
to O
compensate O
for O
the O
delay O
. O

My O
only O
advice O
is O
: O
increase O
portion B-AS
sizes O
; O
and O
develop O
a O
special O
drink B-AS
list I-AS
. O

The O
Scene O
Neither O
trendy O
and O
slick O
nor O
haute O
and O
haughty O
, O
it O
this O
cozy O
wine B-AS
bar I-AS
adds O
a O
bit O
of O
Mediterranean B-AS
sun O
to O
the O
chilly O
east O
70s O
. O

No O
matter O
what O
, O
you O
should O
expect O
a O
wait B-AS
, O
big O
deal O
, O
small O
price O
to O
pay O
for O
great O
food B-AS
as O
far O
as O
I O
' O
m O
concerned O
. O

Service B-AS
is O
not O
what O
one O
would O
expect O
from O
a O
joint O
in O
this O
price B-AS
category I-AS
. O

The O
fresh O
sliced O
mozzerella O
, O
the O
sweet O
roasted O
peppers O
, O
the O
hint O
of O
garlic O
and O
oil O
, O
are O
just O
some O
of O
the O
ingredients B-AS
that O
produce O
the O
light O
otherworldly O
tasty O
pizza B-AS
at O
Grimaldi O
' O

. O

Snack O
on O
a B-AS
bowl I-AS
of I-AS
fried I-AS
chickpeas I-AS
while O
you O
browse O
the O

then O
move O
onto O
the O

which O
arrive O
atop O
a O

of O
French B-AS

perfectly O
poised O
to O

the O

' O

Anyway O
we O
get O
a O
table B-AS
and O
order O
some O
appetizers B-AS
from O
one O
of O
the O
waitresses B-AS
who O
was O
pleasently O
nice O
. O

However O
, O
it O
takes O
ages O
to O
get O
seated O
( O
even O
with O
a O
reservation B-AS
) O
, O
and O
the O
waiters B-AS
don O
' O
t O
seem O
very O
knowledgeable O
about O
the O
menu O
( O
or O
receptive O
to O
questions O
) O
. O

The O
feta O
cheese O
wrapped O
in O
filo B-AS
dough I-AS
and O
deep B-AS
fried I-AS
is O
a O
MUST O
TRY O
appetizer B-AS
. O

The O
hostess B-AS
was O
totally O
not O
accomadating O
, O
and O
even O
though O
there O
were O
empty O
tables O
they O
still O
didn O
' O
t O
seat B-AS
us O
! O

After O
the O
meal B-AS
, O
you O
can O
always O
walk O
a O
little O
southwest O
to O
the O
beautiful O
Nelson B-AS
Rockefeller O
Park O
on O
the O
Hudson O
and O
play O
some O
frisbee O
or O
touch O
football O
. O

the O
service B-AS
was O
slow O
took O
ten O
mins O
to O
get O
me O
a O
glass B-AS
of O
water B-AS
. O

The O
server B-AS
came O
by O
only O
once O
to O
pour O
additional O
wine B-AS
for O
the B-AS
table I-AS
; O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
time O
, O
we O
had O
to O
fish B-AS
the O
bottle B-AS
out O
of O
the O
two O
- O
table O
communal O
bucket O
ourselves O
. O

when O
our O
server B-AS
accidentally O
spilled O
some O
wine B-AS
at O
our O
table B-AS
, O
he O
cleaned O
it O
up O
offered O
us O
another O
glass O
right O
away O
. O

maybe O
its O
the O
cost B-AS
of O
top O
ingredients B-AS
but O
17 O
. O

Ive O
been O
to O
Jacques O
- O
Imo O
in O
New O
Orleans O
, O
the O
wait B-AS
is O
long O
( O
3 O
+ O
hours O
) O
but O
the O
food B-AS
and O
service B-AS
more O
than O
makes O
up O
for O
it O
. O

1 O
) O
Service B-AS
is O
very O
slow O
and O
unattentive O
( O
10 O
minutes O
for O
our O
server B-AS
to O
come O
by O
with O
our O
menus B-AS
and O
to O
take O
our O
drink O
order O
, O
another O
10 O
to O
bring O
the O
drinks O
/ O
take O
our O
dinner B-AS
order O
, O
you O
get O
the O
idea O
. O

Went O
with O
a O
girlfriend O
, O
waited O
for O
over O
an O
hour O
while O
we O
had O
drinks B-AS
, O
food O
was O
ok O
, O
service B-AS
was O
terrible O
. O

The O
Food O
The O
menu B-AS
includes O
lovingly O
made O
renditions O
of O
panini O
, O
bruschetta B-AS
and O
tramezzini B-AS
( O
cocktail O
- O
style O
sandwiches O
with O
fillings O
like O
tuna O
with O
black O
olive O
pesto O
and O
bresaola O
with O
arugula O
) O
, O
along O
with O
a O
roster O
of O
cured O
meats O
, O
cheeses O
and O
olives O
that O
have O
been O
imported O
from O
Italy O
. O

Very O
pleasant O
atmosphere B-AS
, O
not O
a O
quiet O
romantic O
dinner B-AS
. O

Met O
a O
friend O
here O
for O
lunch B-AS
and O
while O
the O
food B-AS
was O
excellent O
( O
I O
ordered O
the O
turkey B-AS
sandwich I-AS
with I-AS
avocado I-AS
and I-AS
bacon I-AS
) O
, O
the O
service O
was O
rather O
unattentive O
- O
- O
though O
well O
meaning O
. O

The O
pastisio O
platter O
especially O
because O
you O
get O
a O
good O
amount O
of O
salad B-AS
that O
' O
s O
dry O
as O
the O
sahara O
desert B-AS
, O
three O
wedges O
of O
bland O
potatoes B-AS
, O
and O
a O
thin O
slice O
of O
microwaved O
pastisio O
that O
was O
awful O
for O
$ O
9 O
. O

They O
also O
have O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
2 B-AS
cheese I-AS
slices I-AS
and O
a O
drink B-AS
for O
$ O
3 O
. O

The O
bill B-AS
came O
out O
to O
like O
$ O
100pp O
, O
and O
noone O
touched O
their O
food B-AS
, O
and O
drinks B-AS
were O
left O
untouched O
because O
after O
the O
first O
bite O
/ O
sip O
you O
want O
to O
never O
touch O
it O
again O
. O

The O
place B-AS
was O
so O
dark O
, O
I O
needed O
the O
table B-AS
candle O
to O
read O
the O
menu B-AS
and O
could O
not O
properly O
see O
what O
I O
was O
eating O
. O

I O
recommend O
the O
jelly B-AS
fish I-AS
, O
drunken B-AS
chicken I-AS
and O
the O
soupy B-AS
dumplings I-AS
, O
certainly O
the O
stir B-AS
fry I-AS
blue I-AS
crab I-AS
. O

I O
expected O
high O
prices B-AS
at O
Nello O
, O
but O
as O
I O
looked O
at O
the O
menu B-AS
my O
eyes O
became O
as O
large O
as O
the O
Birkin O
Mary O
- O
Kate O
has O
been O
seen O
toting O
around O
these O
days O
- O
- O
$ O

, O
$ O
22 O
for O
a O
plate O
of O
mixed O
greens O
, O
$ O
40 O
for O
pasta O
. O

sometimes O
i O
' O
ve O
just O
ordered O
arepas O
and O
empanadas O
for O
my O
meal B-AS
; O
other O
times O
, O
i O
' O
ve O
split O
a O
dinner B-AS
entree I-AS
and O
an O
appetizer B-AS
with O
a O
friend O
and O
been O
satisfied O
, O
since O
the O
portions B-AS
are O
so O
huge O
. O

The O
space B-AS
is O
grand O
with O
a O
very O
high O
ceiling B-AS
although O
it O
is O
one O
of O
those O
places O
that O
they O
keep O
so O
dark O
you O
are O
not O
really O
sure O
what O
you O
are O
eating O
anyway O
. O

The O
menu O
has O
many O
choices O
, O
and O
the O
dining B-AS
experience I-AS
lends O
itself O
to O
being O
a O
great O
place B-AS
for O
a O
date O
, O
client O
dinner O
, O
parents O
' O
dinner O
or O
even O
a O
start O
- O
off O
to O
a O
night O
out O
on O
the O
town O
. O

The O
prices O
are O
incredibly O
reasonable O
, O
especially O
considering O
the O
HUGE O
portions B-AS
- O
by O
noodle B-AS
soup I-AS
could O
have O
fed O
both O
my O
husband O
and O
myself O
. O

About O
10 O
of O
us O
came O
here O
for O
drinks B-AS
last O
friday O
, O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
was O
good O
for O
chatting O
and O
hanging O
out O
, O
but O
not O
enough O
lounge B-AS
or O
bar O
space O
, O
they O
should O
open O
up O
the O
back O
area O
w O
/ O
more O
loungable O
chairs O
or O
booths O
if O
they O
want O
to O
catch O
any O
after O
dinner B-AS
sort O
of O
bar B-AS
crowd I-AS
. O

It O
' O
s O
a O
small O
and O
quaint O
place B-AS
so O
have O
your O
expectations O
in O
check B-AS
, O
but O
that O
doesn O
' O
t O
mean O
anything O
bad O
- O
know O
going O
in O
that O
you O
are O
gonna O
eat O
some O
serious O
food B-AS
! O

It O
was O
not O
the O
mistake O
of O
the O
frozen B-AS
lasagna I-AS
, O
it O
was O
the O
icy O
service B-AS
of O
the O
manager B-AS
which O
has O
spoiled O
this O
restaurant O
for O
me O
. O

Also O
, O
they O
upped O
their O
prices B-AS
, O
so O
I O
have O
their O
old O
menu B-AS
, O
and O
was O
surprised O
when O
my O
bill B-AS
came O
to O
over O
$ O
5 O
more O
than O
it O
used O
to O
( O
I O
know O
, O
not O
a O
huge O
deal O
) O
. O

They O
crumbed O
the O
table B-AS
once O
, O
although O
it O
was O
solied O
the O
entire O
meal B-AS
. O

We O
asked O
for O
more O
coffee B-AS
, O
water B-AS
and O
couldn O
' O
t O
even O
get O
that O
from O
our O
server B-AS
. O

It O
' O
s O
a O
great O
place O
, O
the O
terrific O
service B-AS
carried O
out O
throughout O
the O
night O
as O
we O
sat O
and O
got O
some O
appetizers B-AS
and O
then O
decided O
to O
stay O
for O
a O
bottle O
too O
! O

The O
Food B-AS
Regulars O
swear O
by O
the O
tamales B-AS
, O
which O
are O
spongy O
, O
well O
- O
seasoned O
and O
pulled O
from O
steaming O
crocks O
on O
the O
counter B-AS
. O

I O
always O
listen O
to O
the O
waiters B-AS
' O
recommendations O
, O
because O
they O
' O
re O
always O
awesome O
- O
either O
a O
special O
or O
just O
one O
of O
their O
faves O
off O
the O
menu B-AS
. O

Not O
including O
the O
tip B-AS
for O
our O
server B-AS
, O
who O
we O
saw O
twice O
in O
an O
hour O
? O

Get O
a O
pitcher O
of O
red O
or O
white B-AS
sangria I-AS
and O
choose O
from O
a O
large O
selection O
of O
tapas B-AS
. O

Aside O
from O
the O
fact O
the O
maitre B-AS
de O
claimed O
the O
dining O
room O
was O
' O
full O
' O
, O
we O
were O
seated O
at O
a O
great O
table O
overlooking O
the O
lobby B-AS
of O
the O
hotel O
and O
ordered O
the O
5 O
course O
tasting O
menu B-AS
. O

The O
only O
apparent O
flavor B-AS
in O
any O
of O
the O
dishes O
was O
heat O
, O
and O
a O
table B-AS
of O
four O
gourmands O
left O
at O
least O
half O
of O
our O
meals B-AS
on O
our O
plates O
. O

Miyagi O
is O
my O
sushi O
restaurant O
of O
choice O
in O
the O
Village O
; O
it O
' O
s O
never O
insanely O
crowded O
, O
the O
service B-AS
is O
very O
sweet O
( O
I O
' O
ve O
never O
experienced O
any O
of O
the O
nastiness O
described O
in O
prior O
reviews O
) O
, O
and O
the O
tabs B-AS
are O
small O
. O

My O
ceasar B-AS
salad I-AS
amounted O
to O
some O
limp O
lettuce B-AS
and O
mayo O
strewn O
around O
a O
large O
plate B-AS
, O
and O
the O
only O
way O
I O
might O
have O
died O
for O
the O
mac B-AS
and I-AS
cheese I-AS
is O
due O
to O
natural O
causes O
while O
waiting O
for O
it O
to O
arrive O
. O

and O
am O
content O
with O
a O
dinner B-AS
of O
just O
the O
grilled O
tentacles O
and O
salad B-AS
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
non O
- O
existant O
, O
the O
manager B-AS
spent O
all O
of O
his O

A O

meal O
took O
2 O
1 O
/ O
2 O
hours O
, O
including O
20 O
- O
30 O
minutes O
waiting B-AS
to O
get O
the O
check O
after O
dessert B-AS
. O

We O
then O
waited O
until O
7 O
: O
35 O
before O
any O
food B-AS
arrived O
at O
our O
table B-AS
, O
despite O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
kept O
reminding O
our O
waitress B-AS
that O
we O
needed O
to O
leave O
by O
7 O
: O
45 O
. O

the O
waitress B-AS
came O
to O
ask O
me O
how O
my O
NY O
Strip O
was O
, O
and O
I O
could O
not O
give O
her O
an O
answer O

The O
cupcakes O
at O
magnolia O
' O
s O
are O
world O
famous O
as O
of O
the O
article O
in O
The O
new O
york O
times O
but O
although O
these O
cupcakes O
are O
excellent O
i O
would O
like O
to O
say O
that O
the O
people O
in O
magnolia O
' O
s O
were O
very O
rude O
and O
another O
thing O
was O
that O
they O
were O
overpriced O
and O
this O
dessert B-AS
place O
has O
very O
good O
food B-AS
! O
! O

I O
' O
d O
recommend O
getting O
an O
appetizer O
b O
/ O
c O
the O
dinner B-AS
takes O
a O
bit O
to O
be O
cooked O
, O
but O
it O
was O
definitely O
worth O
the O
wait B-AS
. O

The O
waitress B-AS
was O
no O
where O
to O
be O
found O
at O
all O
throughout O
the O
course O
of O
the O
meal O
, O
did O
not O
refill O
a O
single B-AS
drink I-AS
nor O
did O
she O
bother O
to O
inquire O
about O
my O
satisfaction O
with O
the O
food B-AS
or O
even O
bring O
the O
check O
at O
the O
conclusion O
of O
the O
meal O
. O

This O
Restaurant O
was O
very O
Ask O
to O
the O
waiter O
or O
waitress B-AS
to O
give O
you O
a O
table O
in O
the O
back B-AS
room I-AS
where O
all O
the O
romance O
of O
the O
place O
is O
situated O
with O
a O
so O
- O
called O
chimney O
! O
! O

very O
nice O
servers B-AS
, O
but O
they O
seemed O
more O
interested O
in O
conversing O
with O
the O
regulars O
than O
bringing O
food B-AS
and O
being O
attentive O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
not O
snooty O
and O
you O
' O
ll O
be O
treated O
the O
same O
whether O
you O
order O
one O
of O
the O
$ O
150 O
+ O
kaiseki B-AS
dinners I-AS
or O
a O
single O
entree B-AS

The O

the O
thin O

pizza B-AS
with I-AS
fresh I-AS
mozzarella I-AS
, O
the O
lobster B-AS
roll I-AS
, O
the O
bratwurst O
direct O
from O
Indiana O
. O

I O
made O
a O
reservation B-AS
on O
- O
line O
quickly O
got O
a O
call O
saying O
that O
the O
resturant O
was O
under O
renovation O
, O
but O
the O
kitchen B-AS
was O
still O
open O
and O
was O
still O
more O
than O
welcome O
to O
come O
enjoy O
dinner O
in O
their O
lounge O
. O

I O
had O
the O
Rack O
of O
Lamb B-AS
, O
mushroom O
stuffies O
, O
and O
champagne B-AS
and O
she O
had O
the O
Chicken B-AS
with I-AS
Soba I-AS
noodles I-AS
and I-AS
baked I-AS
clams I-AS
, O
and O
merlot O
. O

Had O
the O
calves B-AS
liver I-AS
alla O
veneziana O
in O
a O
fine O
rich O
and O
complex O
sauce B-AS
with O
perfectly O
fried B-AS
onions I-AS
. O

A O
friend O
of O
mine O
and O
I O
bumped O
into O
this O
restaurant O
last O
week O
and O
it O
didn O
' O
t O
look O
like O
any O
special O
place B-AS
on O
the O
outside O
, O
but O
when O
we O
looked O
at O
the O
menu B-AS
we O
decided O
to O
give O
it O
a O
try O
. O

The O
eggplant B-AS
parmasean I-AS
was O
AWESOME O
( O
I O
don O
' O
t O
even O
like O
eggplant O
) O
but O
my O
main B-AS
course I-AS
was O
just O
ok O
( O
shrimp B-AS
with I-AS
pasta I-AS
) O
. O

The O
quality O
of O
the O
sushi B-AS
was O
bad O
, O
the O
way O
it O
was O
cut O
was O
bad O
, O
and O
the O
waiters B-AS
kept O
trying O
to O
clear O
off O
my O
miso B-AS
soup I-AS
even O
when O
it O
wasn O
' O
t O
finished O
. O

What O
do O
you O
like O
more O
, O
completely O
addictive O
patties B-AS
of O
greasy O
beef B-AS
, O
or O
glasses B-AS
of O
cheap O
refreshing O
beer O
to O
wash O
it O
down O
? O

The O
manager B-AS
apologized O
and O
gave O
us O
back O
$ O
20 O
for O
the O
difference O
, O
BUT O
THE O
WAITER B-AS
NEVER O
RETURNED O
THE O
$ O
120 O
CASH O
WE O
PAID O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
great O
so O
that O
made O
up O
for O
the O
lack O
of O
service B-AS
from O
the O
waitress O
. O

The O
defining O
characteristic O
of O
this O
popular O
restaurant O
, O
aside O
from O
dirt O
- O
cheap O
hot B-AS
dogs I-AS
, O
is O
the O
beverage B-AS
selection I-AS
, O
which O
includes O
a O
light O
and O
refreshing O
papaya B-AS
juice I-AS
, O
an O
extremely O
sweet O
pineapple O
juice O
and O
a O
sweet O
and O
frothy O
pina O
colada O
drink B-AS
. O

Though O
I O
wasn O
' O
t O
starving O
, O
it O
was O
still O
a O
bit O
surprising O
to O
find O
four O
( O
yes O
, O
FOUR O
) O
scallops B-AS
on O
my O
plate O
for O
dinner B-AS
. O

Had O
a O
party O
of O
7 O
people O
for O
dinner B-AS
here O
on O
a O
busy O
night O
for O
the O
restaurant O
, O
and O
our O
meal B-AS
was O
excellent O
and O
served O
with O
extreme O
consistency O
( O
all O
appetizers O
and O
main O
courses O
were O
served O
at O
the O
right O
times O
, O
with O
none O
of O
the O
dishes B-AS
served I-AS
at O
the O
wrong O
temperature O
) O
. O

I O
told O
the O
waiter B-AS
that O
my O
drink B-AS
tasted O
very O
bad O
and O
asked O
if O
he O
could O
swap O
it O
out O
for O
a O
Petron O
Margarita O
. O

I O
have O
eaten O
here O
for O
nearly O
three O
years O
, O
with O
firends O
with O
family B-AS
, O
the O
service B-AS
is O
great O
attentive O
and O
informed O
, O
perfect O
for O
Thursdays O
, O
Fridays O
and O
Saturdays O
. O

I O
couple O
of O
weeks O
ago O
we O
went O
to O
Supper O
in O
the O
east O
village O
and O
it O
was O
so O
bad O
that O
we O
got O
up O
and O
left O
and O
the O
only O
way O
to O
save O
the O
evening O
of O
horrible O
food B-AS
was O
to O
go O
to O
Blue O
Ribbon O
Bakery B-AS
and O
have O
at O
least O
one O
thing O
off O
the O
menu B-AS
. O

The O
night O
I O
was O
there O
, O
besides O
extraordinary O
food B-AS
and O
service B-AS
, O
the O
owners B-AS
; O
Carmelo O
Leotta O
and O
Pietro O
Cinquemani O
were O
belting O
out O
Mario O
Lanzi O
tunes O
on O
the O
Steinway O
piano O
. O

The O
waitress B-AS
gave O
us O
attitude O
because O
we O
orderred O
the O
price B-AS
fix O
and O
not O
the O
regular O
menu B-AS
. O

I O
won O
' O
t O
even O
wait O
for O
an O
hour O
and O
a O
half O
when O
I O
don O
' O
t O
have O
reservations B-AS
, O
but O
the O
hostess B-AS
and O
the O
pompous B-AS
maitre I-AS
d O
' O
just O
jerked O
me O
around O
and O
kept O
on O
promising O
me O
that O
I O
' O
d O
be O
the O
next O
to O
be O
seated O
. O

And O
with O
all O
their O
recent O
additions O
( O
a O
jazz B-AS
bar I-AS
, O
and O
fabulous O
garden B-AS
dining I-AS
) O
I O
find O
that O
I O
visit O
more O
now O
than O
ever O
. O

I O
can O
' O
t O
imagine O
waiting O
for O
20 O
minutes O
to O
have O
my O
plates B-AS
removed O
, O
given O
that O
usually O
the O
waitstaff B-AS
hover O
around O
like O
birds O
of O
prey O
waiting O
for O
a O
fork O
to O
drop O
etc O
. O

I O
strongly O
recommend O
dining B-AS
here O
, O
bringing O
a O
date O
, O
etc O
; O
As O
for O
me O
, O
next O
time O
I O
am O
going O
to O
try O
the O
beef B-AS
from O
the O
true O
Japanese O
- O
style O
charcoal O
grille O
! O

The O
waitress B-AS
could O
have O
been O
more O
specific O
when O
I O
asked O
for O
a O
wine B-AS
suggestion I-AS
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
appeared O
promptly O
, O
took O
our O
order O
, O
bought O
us O
drinks B-AS
and O
was O
never O
to O
be O
seen O
again O
. O

The O
service B-AS
can O
be O
lacking O
at O
times O
, O
but O
the O
desserts B-AS
and O
overall O
experience O
certainly O
counter O
this O
flaw O
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
seemed O
astounded O
that O
I O
ordered O
no O
wine B-AS
or O
alcohol O
- O
- O
just O
water O
- O
- O
with O
my O
meal B-AS
. O

I O
had O
a O
turkey B-AS
melt I-AS
, O
the O
turkey O
was O
fresh O
, O
fries B-AS
were O
good O
. O

Lastly O
, O
the O
bartender B-AS
didnt O
give O
me O
detailed O
bill B-AS
, O
just O
my O
credit O
card O
receipt O
to O
sign O
. O

00 O
one O
does O
expect O
more O
than O
three O
small O
shrimp B-AS
, O
one O
crab O
cake O
and O
two O
broiled B-AS
scallops I-AS
. O

We O
had O
reservations B-AS
and O
when O
we O
showed O
up O
the O
manager B-AS
told O
us O
the O
wait B-AS
was O
over O
45 O
mins O
. O

The O
wine O
list O
was O
had O
some O
of O
my O
favorites O
which O
I O
have O
not O
seen O
anywhere O
in O
New O
York O
, O
and O
when O
I O
clumsily O
spilled O
both O
water B-AS
and O
wine O
all O
of O
the O
my O
table B-AS
the O
waitress B-AS
and O
manager B-AS
were O
there O
in O
a O
flash O
jovially O
helping O
me O
clear O
up O
the O
mess O
. O

I O
also O
watched O
several O
other O
frustrated O
customers O
getting O
the O
wrong O
orders O
or O
trying O
to O
catch O
the O
waiter B-AS
' O
s O
attention O
( O
he O
was O
posing O
at O
the O
soda B-AS
fountain O
) O
. O

The O
ambience B-AS
was O
all O
wrong O
, O
the O
bar B-AS
opened O
into O
the O
main O
dining O
room O
causing O
the O
noise B-AS
to O
flow O
into O
the O
room O
. O

yes O
this O
place O
has O
good O
pizza B-AS
but O
HORRIFIC O
HORRIFIC O
delivery O
service B-AS
. O

I O
don O
' O
t O
remember O
the O
dessert B-AS
item O
but O
when O
it O
was O
brought O
out O
flashing O
lights O
overhead O
threw O
colored O
beams O
on O
the O
walls O
and O
a O
young O
waiter B-AS
came O
over O
to O
our O
table O
and O
did O
a O
little O
dance B-AS
that O
was O
Bollywood O
MTV O
for O
the O
East O
Village O
set O
. O

The O
execution O
in O
the O
dining B-AS
room I-AS
was O
on O
point O
and O
we O
never O
had O
any O
service O
or O
food B-AS
issues O
. O

For O
the O
main B-AS
course I-AS
, O
try O
out O
the O
Beef B-AS
Negimaki I-AS
. O

They O
were O
rude O
, O
didn O
' O
t O
know O
their O
drinks B-AS
and O
were O
unable O
to O
demonstrate O
any O
professionalism O
in O
their O
service B-AS
mentality O
. O

Breakfast O
, O
lunch O
or O
dinner B-AS
- O
Teresa O
' O
s O
serves O
up O
a O
hearty O
meal B-AS
each O
and O
every O
time O
. O

With O
the O
large O
crowds B-AS
here O
and O
the O
larger O
menu O
, O
be O
prepared O
to O
wait O
for O
your O
dinner B-AS
to O
arrive O
at O
your O
table B-AS
. O

If O
your O
friends O
persuade O
you O
to O
check O
this O
place O
out O
, O
I O
suggest O
that O
you O
order O
all O
of O
your O
drinks B-AS
, O
apps O
, O
entrees O
, O
desserts O
, O
and O
the O
check O
up O
front O
, O
because O
you O
' O
ll O
never O
see O
your O
server B-AS
again O
. O

The O
manager B-AS
claimed O
that O
he O
could O
not O
compensate O
us O
for O
anything O
on O
the O
bill B-AS
which O
just O
shows O
the O
lack O
of O
sophistication O
from O
the O
entire O
group O
. O

Our O
spastic O
waiter B-AS
was O
running O
around O
like O
a O
chicken O
with O
his O
head O
cut O
off O
, O
and O
, O
thus O
, O
slow O
to O
take O
our O
order O
, O
slow O
to O
bring O
us O
our O
drinks B-AS
( O
they O
sat O
on O
the O
bar B-AS
for O
5 O
- O
10 O
minutes O
) O
and O
slow O
to O
get O
us O
the O
water B-AS
we O
had O
to O
ask O
for O
repeatedly O
. O

Our O
waitress B-AS
was O
very O
nice O
, O
not O
snotty O
- O
she O
even O
gave O
us O
a O
free O
apertif O
after O
the O
meal B-AS
( O
and O
left O
the O
bottle O
on O
the O
table O
) O
. O

We O
recently O
had O
brunch B-AS
at O
this O
establishment O
with O
two O
other O
couples O
and O
I O
have O
to O
say O
I O
was O
majorly O
dissapointed O
with O
the O
service B-AS
and O
how O
we O
were O
treated O
. O

Just O
sit O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
and O
sip O
some O
amazing O
Italian O
wines B-AS
. O

However O
when O
the O
party O
was O
complete O
we O
had O
the O
other O
waitress B-AS
come O
over O
who O
said O
that O
we O
had O
to O
order O
all O
the O
food B-AS
at O
once O
and O
couldnt O
order O
just O
appetizers B-AS
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
kept O
coming O
up O
and O
asking O
to O
take O
our O
plates B-AS
while O
we O
were O
still O
eating O
and O
the O
manager B-AS
stood O
and O
stared O
at O
us O
through O
half O
our O
meal B-AS
! O

Nice O
decor B-AS
- O
but O
the O
place B-AS
is O
so O
crowded O
and O
noisy O
you O
can O
' O
t O
enjoy O
it O
. O

I O
will O
be O
back O
not O
only O
because O
the O
price B-AS
was O
so O
unbelievable O
but O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
was O
just O
plain O
COOL O
and O
the O
food B-AS
was O
spectacular O
. O

The O
piano B-AS
guy O
isn O
' O
t O
there O
all O
the O
time O
, O
but O
when O
he O
is O
it O
' O
s O
a O
great O
addition O
to O
the O
meal B-AS
. O

When O
my O
brother O
and O
I O
we O
had O
too O
much O
pizza B-AS
in O
New O
York O
, O
we O
would O
like O
to O
order O
something O
else O
from O
the O
menu B-AS
. O

it O
' O
s O
a O
very O
chill O
spot B-AS
to O
hang O
with O
a O
group O
, O
I O
went O
there O
with O
a O
bunch O
of O
my O
friends O
to O
have O
drinks B-AS
for O
my O
birthday O
and O
we O
all O
had O
a O
great O
time B-AS
. O

The O
nachos B-AS
were O
very O
very O
good O
, O
but O
the O
onion B-AS
bloom I-AS
felt O
too O
greasy O
and O
the O
calamari B-AS
was O
soggy O
. O

The O
Food B-AS
The O
menu O
features O
a O
wide O
array B-AS
of O
Hawaiian O
- O
and O
Asian O
- O
flavored O
appetizers B-AS
and O
entrees O
. O

Our O
waiter B-AS
was O
not O
attentive O
, O
we O
waited O
about O
20 O
mins O
just O
to O
order O
drinks B-AS
. O

Asked O
for O
wine B-AS
recommendations O
and O
the O
waitress B-AS
told O
me O
her O
favorites O
and O
described O
them O
in O
detail O
- O
I O
don O
' O
t O
encounter O
this O
much O
in O
NYC O
. O

I O
was O
surprised O
by O
the O
small O
ice B-AS
cream I-AS
dessert I-AS
from O
the O
restaurant O
to O
the O
birthday O
girl O
free O
of O
charge O
, O
but O
if O
they O

going O
to O
give O
a O
nice O
service B-AS
the O
one O
ice B-AS
cream I-AS
scoop I-AS
on O
a O
stick O
didn O
' O

leave O
a O
strong O
enough O
impression O
. O

While O
dining B-AS
on O
a O
delicate O
lamb O
carpaccio O
, O
and O
grilled O
skate O
wing O
, O
the O
owner B-AS
explained O
that O
due O
to O
low O
lunch O
- O
time O
patronage O
, O
they O
may O
be O
discontinuing O
lunch O
altogether O
. O

I O
was O
told O
( O
very O
snottily O
) O
no O
, O
but O
then O
not O
even O
10 O
minutes O
later O
another O
group O
of O
people O
came O
in O
, O
asked O
the O
same O
thing O
and O
because O
the O
same O
woman O
waiter B-AS
knew O
them O
she O
gave O
them O
regular O
menus B-AS
! O

Seating O
is O
usually O
very O
prompt O
but O
expect O
a O
wait B-AS
at O
peak O
times O
such O
as O
Sunday O
Brunch B-AS
. O

The O
service O
was O
less O
than O
spectacular O
( O
two O
waiters B-AS
fought O
in O
front O
of O
us O
over O
which O
one O
got O
our O
table O
) O
and O
the O
bread B-AS
put O
out O
as O
an O
appetizer B-AS
was O
sub O
- O
par O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
' O
s O
a O
bit O
grungy O
, O
yes O
, O
but O
the O
music B-AS
and O
the O
coffee B-AS
are O
good O
. O

Other O
temptations O
include O
spumoni O
, O
tortoni O
, O
cannoli B-AS
, O
cookies B-AS
( O
try O
the O
pinoli O
) O
, O
tarts O
and O
fluffy O
white B-AS
cakes I-AS
to O
order O
. O

The O
menu B-AS
ranged O
from O
standard O
( O
steak B-AS
, O
duck B-AS
and O
mussels O
- O
all O
fantastic O
) O
to O
curious O
( O
ostrich O
- O
awesome O
, O
and O
tartare O
- O
smoked O
not O
raw O
but O
still O
so O
good O
. O

The O
food O
is O
decent O
, O
average O
bistro B-AS
food I-AS
, O
the O
decor B-AS
is O
nice O
, O
but O
the O
service O
is O
poor O
, O
the O
waiters B-AS
always O
seems O
to O
have O
to O
many O
tables B-AS
andcant O
keep O
up O
with O
a O
good O
services O
. O

It O
took O
1 O
1 O
/ O
4 O
hours O
to O
get O
our O
appetizers B-AS
( O
how O
long O
does O
salad B-AS
take O
) O
and O
when O
we O
complained O
to O
the O
manager B-AS
, O
he O
barely O
listened O
. O

I O
would O
have O
told O
the O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
if O
anyone O
had O
asked O
me O
if O
I O
enjoyed O
my O
meal B-AS
, O
but O
no O
one O
asked O
. O

This O
time O
, O
the O
service B-AS
was O
decent O
and O
the O
food B-AS
was O
mediocre O
at O
best O
. O

The O
food O
was O
pretty O
good O
, O
but O
due O
to O
our O
large O
size O
( O
~ O
16 O
) O
the O
manager B-AS
asked O
us O
to O
limit O
our O
appetizers B-AS
to O
just O
3 O
selections O
b O
/ O
c O
he O
didn O
' O
t O
want O
to O
overburden O
his O
cooks O
. O

It O
is O
always O
hard O
to O
find O
a O
seat B-AS
and O
the O
selection B-AS
is O
not O
that O
great O
but O
it O
is O
one O
of O
the O
few O
places O
to O
get O
lunch O
for O
only O
a O
buck O
. O

I O
love O
the O
food B-AS
here O
, O
and O
although O
it O
is O
pricey O
, O
the O
entree B-AS
comes O
with O
rice O
, O
naan B-AS
, O
dal B-AS
, O
and O
salad B-AS
, O
which O
makes O
it O
worthwhile O
. O

I O
' O
m O
not O
a O
fan O
of O
any O
of O
their O
appetizers B-AS
or O
Thai B-AS
food I-AS
, O
but O
their O
Japanese B-AS
food I-AS
is O
great O
. O

A O
bustling O

and O

, O

, O
and O
ladies O
who O
lunch O
. O

our O
waiter B-AS
forgot O
a O
dish B-AS
and O
we O
were O
constantly O
checked O
on O
afterwards O
and O
treated O
to O
a O
complimentary O
dessert B-AS
for O
the O
mix B-AS
up I-AS
. O

The O
Black B-AS
Duck I-AS
is O
a O
great O
date O
place O
, O
whether O
going O
for O
dinner B-AS
or O
just O
for O
a O
drink B-AS
at O
their O
huge O
, O
antique O
- O
ish O
bar O
. O

I O
understand O
the O
area O
and O
folks O
you O
need O
not O
come O
here O
for O
the O
romantic O
, O
alluring O
ambiance B-AS
or O
the O
five O
star O
service B-AS
featuring O
a O
sommlier B-AS
and O
a O
complicated O
maze O
of O
captain B-AS
and O
back B-AS
waiters I-AS
- O
you O
come O
for O
the O
authentic O
foods B-AS
, O
the O
tastes O
, O
the O
experiance O
. O

The O
other O
two O
entrees B-AS
that O
were O
ordered O
were O
very O
large O
portions B-AS
. O

Tried O
it O
again O
for O
brunch B-AS
, O
when O
the O
service B-AS
was O
worse O
. O

the O
service B-AS
is O
pushy O
and O
the O
food B-AS
looks O
good O
but O
is O
completely O
average O
( O
chewy O
steak B-AS
, O
tasteless O
rice O
and O
beans O
) O
. O

however O
, O
we O
went O
for O
lunch B-AS
and O
were O
the O
only O
ones O
eating O
there O
and O
yet O
the O
service B-AS
seemed O
eager O
for O
us O
to O
be O
done O
and O
to O
get O
out O
. O

Downtown O
Dinner B-AS
2002 O
- O
Prixe O
fix O
: O
Appetizers B-AS
were O
ok O
, O
waiter B-AS
gave O
me O
poor O
suggestion O
. O

Perhaps O
if O
the O
owner B-AS
manager I-AS
would O
concentrate O
more O
on O
service B-AS
then O
acting O
as O
a O
dj B-AS
this O
restaurant O
would O
run O
better O
. O

Once O
at O
the O
table O
our O
waitress B-AS
managed O
on O
two O
occasions O
to O
take O
15 O
minutes O
bringing O
drinks B-AS
to O
our O
table O
, O
our O
plates B-AS
sat O
uncleared O
on O
the O
table O
for O
just O
as O
long O
. O

nice O
place O
, O
good O
service B-AS
but O
the O
price O
is O
a O
little O
bit O
more O
expensive O
when O
compare O
with O
the O
area O
, O
location B-AS
and O
small O
dishes B-AS
. O

My O
boyfriend O
and O
I O
went O
one O
Friday O
night O
to O
find O
that O
the O
place B-AS
was O
empty O
except O
for O
one O
other O
table B-AS
. O

The O
servers B-AS
and O
/ O
or O
bus O
persons O
dart O
back O
and O
forth O
through O
the O
dining B-AS
room I-AS
, O
never O
even O
making O
eye O
contact O
to O
see O
if O
you O
have O
any O
needs O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
could O
be O
considered O
amiable O
, O
if O
you O
possess O
roguish O
frat O
- O
boy O
nostalgia B-AS
. O

I O
' O
ve O
only O
been O
in O
a O
few O
times O
for O
brunch B-AS
as O
it O
does O
get O
quite O
busy O
, O
it O
' O
s O
worth O
it O
though O
especially O
now O
that O
they O
have O
those O
amazing O
Blueberry B-AS
Waffles I-AS
. O

Got O
the O
scoop O
on O
this O
new O
hot O
spot B-AS
and O
decided O
to O
give O
it O
shot O
for O
a O
client O
dinner B-AS
. O

The O
waiters B-AS
knocked O
over O
my O
purse O
3 O
times O
and O
spilled O
water B-AS
on O
the O
table O
3 O
times O
as O
well O
. O

This O
is O
definitely O
a O
special O
occasion O
spot B-AS
, O
unless O
you O
don O
' O
t O
mind O
a O
hefty O
bill B-AS
, O
but O
rest O
assured O
that O
either O
way O
, O
it O
' O
s O
well O
worth O
it O
. O

Our O
waiter B-AS
didn O
' O
t O
really O
know O
the O
menu B-AS
and O
was O
not O
attentive O
. O

The O
place B-AS
was O
packed O
but O
we O
were O
able O
to O
get O
drinks B-AS
at O
the O
bar B-AS
w O
/ O
out O
a O
problem O
despite O
the O
crowd O
. O

Mussels B-AS
in O
deeply O
aromatic O
lemongrass O
broth O
make O
an O
excellent O
starter B-AS
, O
as O
do O
the O
light O
and O
spicy O
house O
samosas O
. O

With O
a O
chef B-AS
from O
Liguria O
, O
Italy O
, O
authentic O
Neapolitan O
brick B-AS
oven I-AS
pizza O
and O
one O
of O
the O
most O
impressive O
Italian O
wine B-AS
lists O
I O
' O
ve O
ever O
seen O
, O
this O
was O
the O
real O
deal O
! O

Very O
cheesy O
wanna O
be O
romantic O
decor B-AS
and O
entertainment B-AS
, O
but O
have O
some O
vodka O
and O
you O
want O
to O
come O
right O
out O
onto O
the O
dance B-AS
floor I-AS
and O
dance O
the O
night O
away O
to O
a O
mix O
of O
really O
bad O
russian O
and O
american O
disco B-AS
music I-AS
. O

The O
place B-AS
was O
beautiful O
, O
I O
sat O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
for O
two O
hours O
and O
eat O
oysters B-AS
and O
had O
way O
too O
many O
martinis O
. O

The O
menu B-AS
had O
some O
slight O
twists O
to O
conventional O
upscale O
Mexican B-AS
. O

So O
inexcpensive O
that O
you O
' O
d O
wonder O
about O
the O
sanity O
of O
the O
owners B-AS
, O
if O
they O
weren O
' O
t O
such O
good O
cooks B-AS
. O

The O
appetizer B-AS
came O
out O
cold O
and O
the O
waiter B-AS
came O
and O
took O
it O
to O
the O
kitchen O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
delish O
, O
you O
just O
have O
to O
know O
the O
manners O
to O
consume O
, O
if O
you O
don O
' O
t O
want O
to O
be O
frustrated O
with O
the O
service B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
served O
in O
small O
portions B-AS
and O
my O
lamb B-AS
was O
pure O
fat O
. O

Invited O
by O
friends O
to O
discuss O
business O
, O
I O
checked O
out O
the O
bar B-AS
first O
, O
and O
didn O
' O
t O
give O
my O
nme O
which O
was O
known O
to O
the O
owners B-AS
Scott O
Heather O
. O

Bins O
of O
fresh O
bagels B-AS
rest O
behind O
the O
counter B-AS
, O
and O
there O
are O
always O
a O
few O
customers O
sitting O
at O
one O
of O
the O
few O
tables O
inside O
or O
on O
one O
of O
two O
wooden O
benches O
out O
front O
. O

The O
food B-AS
makes O
up O
for O
it O
, O
though O
the O
quality B-AS
has O
fallen O
victim O
to O
it O
' O
s O
success O
. O

A O
hour O
passed O
until O
the O
waitress B-AS
came O
over O
to O
give O
us O
menus B-AS
and O
tell O
us O
she O
would O
be O
right O
back O
another O
hour O
later O
After O
trying O
to O
order O
fish O
she O
informed O
us O
that O
all O
fish B-AS
entrees I-AS
on O
the O
menu O
was O
sold O
out O
We O
took O
a O
minute O
to O
make O
a O
second O
choice O
and O
tried O
to O
order O
something O
else O
that O
we O
were O
told O
was O
also O
sold O
out O
. O

The O
only O
dishes B-AS
that O
were O
good O
were O
the O
chicken O
kebob O
( O
not O
hard O
to O
make O
) O
and O
the O
desserts B-AS
, O
which O
were O
rice B-AS
pudding I-AS
. O

Raymunds O
dishes B-AS
up O
the O
best O
Polish B-AS
comfort I-AS
food I-AS
Ive O
ever O
had O
outside O
of O
my O
great O
- O
aunts O
kitchen B-AS
. O

After O
being O
seated O
took O
our O
waiter B-AS
10 O
mintues O
to O
get O
us O
a O
menu B-AS
, O
15 O
minutes O
to O
come O
back O
for O
our O
order O
, O
by O
the O
time O
we O
finally O
got O
our O
food B-AS
it O
was O
almost O
1 O
1 O
/ O
2 O
hour O
since O
getting O
there O
. O

2 O
weeks O
ago O
, O
I O
decided O
to O
set O
up O
a O
birthday O
dinner B-AS
in O
this O
establishment O
and O
was O
wary O
with O
the O
reviews O
I O
' O
ve O
read O
in O
City O
Search O
but O
it O
seems O
to O
be O
a O
perfect O
scene B-AS
. O

While O
there O
' O
s O
a O
strong O
Asian O
influence O
behind O
many O
of O
the O
plates B-AS
, O
you O
can O
' O
t O
pigeonhole O
the O
food B-AS
into O
a O
single O
genre O
, O
as O
there O
are O
Thai O
, O
Chinese O
, O
Japanese B-AS
, O
Italian O
and O
American O
dishes O
incorporated O
into O
this O
creative O
menu B-AS
. O

Moules B-AS
were O
excellent O
, O
lobster B-AS
ravioli I-AS
was O
VERY O
salty O
! O

A O
little O
pricier O
than O
most O
veggie B-AS
restaurants O
, O
but O
worth O
it O
if O
only O
for O
the O
dessert B-AS
menu I-AS
( O
as O
a O
wheat O
- O
sensitive O
, O
diabetic O
vegan B-AS
, O
there O
aren O
' O
t O
too O
many O
places O
I O
can O
even O
LOOK O
at O
desserts O
, O
and O
this O
may O
be O
the O
only O
one O
where O
I O
can O
actually O
EAT O
what O
they O
serve O
me O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
excellent O
from O
the O
barbecued B-AS
lamb I-AS
at O
$ O
13 O
. O

Despite O
being O
the O
only O
people O
in O
the O
restaurant O
on O
an O
early O
sunday O
afternoon O
, O
the O
service B-AS
felt O
as O
if O
there O
was O
a O
2 O
- O
hour O

on O
a O
friday O
night O

For O

dishes I-AS
and O
their O

( O
made O
out O
of O
sweet B-AS

) O
is O
to O
die O
for O
. O

The O
Food B-AS
Skip O
the O
menu B-AS
and O
head O
for O
the O
restaurant O
' O
s O
bountiful O
and O
ever O
- O
changing O
vegan O
buffet O
for O
an O
abundance O
of O
affordable O
servings B-AS
. O

The O
space B-AS
was O
so O
fantastic O
that O
once O
we O
heard O
they O
were O
serving B-AS
dinner I-AS
we O
decided O
to O
go O
one O
night O
and O
try O
it O
out O
. O

If O
you O
don O
' O
t O
want O
to O
wait O
45 O
minutes O
for O
a O
table B-AS
or O
a O
long O
time O
for O
service B-AS
then O
don O
' O
t O
go O
@ O
9pm O
on O
a O
Friday O
or O
Saturday O
night O
. O

The O
menu B-AS
is O
quite O
substantial O
, O
with O
a O
number O
of O
chicken O
, O
beef B-AS
, O
and O
seafood O
specialties O
not O
found O
at O
your O
typical O
chinese O
restaurant O
. O

We O
initially O
ordered O
a O
bottle O
of O
wine O
and O
the O
waitress B-AS
though O
we O
may O
not O
like O
it O
, O
so O
she O
offered O
us O
a O
taste B-AS
. O

The O
portions B-AS
are O
small O
but O
being O
that O
the O
food B-AS
was O
so O
good O
makes O
up O
for O
that O
. O

The O
ravioli B-AS
was O
the O
better O
of O
the O
two O
, O
but O
the O
serving B-AS
was O
tiny O
, O
and O
the O
skin O
a O
bit O
rubbery O

there O
for O
YEARS O

they O
know O
their O

amazing O
. O

( O
I O
will O
say O
, O
the O

was O
very O
sweet O
and O
did O
try O
to O
compensate O
for O
the O

I O
live O
about O
a O
1 O

2 O
block O
from O
Westway O
and O
when O
I O
want O
consistantly O
good O
food O
, O
big O

, O
great O
fast O
service B-AS
and O
a O
step O
above O
your O
average O
diner B-AS
food I-AS
I O
go O
there O
! O

We O
politely O
asked O
our O
server B-AS
for O
the O
regular O
menu O
, O
but O
were O
told O
that O
for O
large O
parties O
they O
could O
only O
offer O
us O
the O
banquet B-AS
menu I-AS
( O
would O
have O
gone O
elsewhere O
had O
we O
known O
) O
. O

The O
waitress B-AS
never O
came O
back O
to O
get O
drink B-AS
refills O
and O
we O
didn O
' O
t O
get O
water O
until O
we O
were O
halfway O
through O
our O
dinner B-AS
. O

We O
were O
immediately O
seated O
( O
the O
restaurant O
was O
no O
where O
close O
to O
being O
packed O
, O
surprise O
, O
surprise O
) O
There O
are O
very O
few O
selections O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
and O
the O
food B-AS
is O
not O
that O
great O
and O
the O
dining O
experience O
at O
Butter O
is O
completely O
overrated O
. O

Our O
waiter B-AS
never O
once O
asked O
how O
everything O
was O
, O
as O
I O
suspect O
he O
knew O
the O
kitchen B-AS
was O
producing O
seriously O
average O
food B-AS
. O

Main O
courses O
we O
had O
( O
beef B-AS
, O
lobster O
sukiyaki O
, O
black O
seabass O
, O
striped O
seabass O
) O
tasted O
too O
much O
like O
homestyle O
authentic O
Chinese B-AS
food I-AS
except O
for O
the O
sukiyaki O
. O

I O
paid O
$ O
12 O
including O
tax O
tip B-AS
for O
a O
beef B-AS
entree I-AS
with I-AS
salad I-AS
, O
noodles B-AS
, O
rice B-AS
, O
a O
fried B-AS
dumpling I-AS
, O
many O
free O
appetizers B-AS
and O
a O
glass O
of O
ice O
water O
. O

Food B-AS
was O
much O
better O
than O
the O
average O
Indian O
place O
in O
the O
area B-AS
, O
and O
more O
interesting O
. O

When O
I O
asked O
the O
manager B-AS
to O
remove O
the O
coffee B-AS
, O
she O
did O
so O
without O
question O
, O
but O
never O
asked O
why O
and O
never O
followed O
up O
on O
the O
issue O
( O
she O
was O
far O
too O
busy O
flirting O
with O
the O
male O
waiters B-AS
) O
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
recommended O
I O
choose O
a O
bottle O
for O
the O
entire O
meal B-AS
. O

As O
for O
the O
food O
, O
brunch B-AS
was O
average O
, O
I O
would O
not O
get O
the O
same O
dish B-AS
again O
, O
and O
they O
were O
slow O
to O
serve O
us O
. O

For O
example O
, O
we O
had O
ordered O
a O
2nd O
bottle B-AS
of I-AS
red I-AS
wine I-AS
, O
the O
waitress B-AS
gave O
me O
a O
new O
glass O
to O
taste O
the O
wine O
, O
but O
filled O
up O
my O
existing O
glass O
( O
mixing O
two O
different O
bottles O
in O
one O
glass O
) O

, O
Hawaiian B-AS

, O

, O
or O

. O

The O
waiter B-AS
was O
very O
attentive O
and O
always O
kept O
the O
bread B-AS
and O
drinks O
coming O
. O

However O
, O
another O
server B-AS
kept O
hovering O
over O
our O
table O
, O
wanting O
to O
take O
our O
half O
- O
finished O
plates B-AS
away O
. O

Their O
bagels B-AS
have O
the O
perfect O
softness O
to O
them O
, O
but O
on O
the O
outside O
there O
' O
s O
a O
bit O
of O
crispiness O
to O
give O
it O
a O
bit O
of O
texture B-AS
. O

but O
the O
Server B-AS
informed O
us O
that O
they O
wanted O
to O
make O
the O
soup B-AS
their O
own O
and O
that O
she O
hopes O
we O
like O
it O
. O

You O
need O
just O
witness O
the O
classic O
wall O
of O
celebrities O
, O
or O
the O
Sinatra B-AS
playing O
over O
the O
speakers O
to O
know O
you O
' O
re O
in O
an O
authentic O
pizza B-AS
joint I-AS
. O

After O
being O
ignored O
by O
our O
waiter B-AS
we O
complained O
to O
the O
manager B-AS
who O
assured O
us O
everything O
would O
improve O
. O

The O
hostess B-AS
failed O
to O
give O
us O
menus B-AS
, O
and O
we O
had O
to O
ask O
our O
waiter O
for O
them O
. O

I O
don O
' O
t O
even O
think O
I O
would O
have O
minded O
waiting O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
for O
over O
an O
hour O
if O
it O
weren O
' O
t O
so O
crowded O
and O
if O
they O
had O
little O
tapas B-AS
for O
the O
hungry O
people O
forced O
to O
wait O
! O

I O
have O
no O
complaints O
about O
the O
wait B-AS
or O
the O
service B-AS
but O
the O
pizza B-AS
was O
not O
at O
all O
something O
to O
write O
home O
about O
. O

Everything O
from O
the O
food B-AS
to O
the O
service B-AS
was O
enjoyable O
about O
this O
place O
, O
but O
I O
can O
' O
t O
recommend O
the O
tempura B-AS
shrimp I-AS
roll I-AS
with O
the O
lobster B-AS
salad I-AS
enough I-AS
. O

Anyway O
, O
I O
went O
down O
on O
a O
Wednesday O
night O
to O
see O
if O
they O
had O
a O
long O
wait B-AS
and O
the O
hostess O
said O
they O
had O
a O
table B-AS
to O
accomodate O
my O
party O
. O

On O
Friday O
night O
the O
busboy B-AS
was O
sulky O
verging O
on O
rude O
; O
he O
brought O
the O
fries O
( O
ordered O
for O
the O
entrees O
) O
twice O
before O
the O
appetizers B-AS
came O
and O
then O
again O
the O
minute O
we O
' O
d O
finished O
them O
and O
looked O
put O
out O
to O
be O
asked O
to O
take O
the O
empty O
plates O
away O
. O

I O
always O
thought O
the O
food B-AS
was O
decent O
, O
but O
not O
spectacular O
and O
the O
price B-AS
fair O
, O
but O
no O
bargain O
. O

Watch O
out O
for O
the O
overworked O
, O
stressed O
out O
waitress B-AS
who O
dumps O
tapa O
dishes B-AS
on O
the O
table B-AS
and O
leaves O
w O
/ O
out O
announcing O
what O
it O
is O
. O

Fortunately O
the O
waitress B-AS
was O
very O
ncie O
about O
this O
, O
and O
did O
not O
give O
me O
a O
hassle O
about O
taking O
the O
cake O
off O
the O
final O
bill B-AS
. O

The O
old O
menu B-AS
items I-AS
are O
gone O
, O
except O
for O
the O
rib B-AS
appetizer I-AS
, O
which O
is O
now O
bland O
and O
fatty O
, O
with O
little O
trace O
of O
the O
excellent O
mustard O
sauce O
. O

The O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
is O
slow O
, O
full O
of O
attitude O
and O
forgettful O
- O
- O
often O
taking O
20 O
minutes O
to O
bring O
another O
round O
of O
food O
and O
drinks B-AS
. O

Our O
waiter B-AS
was O
inattentive O
throughout O
the O
meal B-AS
, O
took O
nearly O
3 O
hours O
for O
dinner B-AS
. O

In O
Short O
The O
much O
- O
copied O
look O
of O
hardwood O
floors O
, O
decorative O
stained B-AS
glass I-AS
, O
checked O
tablecloths O
, O
brass O
rails O
and O
walls B-AS
filled O
with O
knickknacks O
has O
been O
a O
staple O
at O
this O
restaurant O
franchise O
. O

Pair O
you O

with O
the O
excellent O
beers B-AS
on I-AS
tap I-AS
or O

well O
priced B-AS
