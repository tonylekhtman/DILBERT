The O
bread B-AS
is O
top O
notch O
as O
well O
. O

I O
have O
to O
say O
they O
have O
one O
of O
the O
fastest O
delivery B-AS
times I-AS
in O
the O
city O
. O

Food B-AS
is O
always O
fresh O
and O
hot O
ready O
to O
eat O
! O

Did O
I O
mention O
that O
the O
coffee B-AS
is O
OUTSTANDING O
? O

Certainly O
not O
the O
best O
sushi O
in O
New O
York O
, O
however O
, O
it O
is O
always O
fresh O
, O
and O
the O
place B-AS
is O
very O
clean O
, O
sterile O
. O

I O
trust O
the O
people B-AS
at O
Go O
Sushi O
, O
it O
never O
disappoints O
. O

Straight O
- O
forward O
, O
no O
surprises O
, O
very O
decent O
Japanese B-AS
food I-AS
. O

BEST O
spicy B-AS
tuna I-AS
roll I-AS
, O
great O
asian B-AS
salad I-AS
. O

Try O
the O
rose B-AS
roll I-AS
not O
on O
menu B-AS
. O

I O
love O
the O
drinks B-AS
, O
esp O
lychee B-AS
martini I-AS
, O
and O
the O
food B-AS
is O
also O
VERY O
good O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
this O
was O
not O
a O
Nicoise B-AS
salad I-AS
and O
was O
barely O
eatable O
. O

While O
there O
's O
a O
decent O
menu B-AS
, O
it O
should O
n't O
take O
ten O
minutes O
to O
get O
your O
drinks B-AS
and O
45 O
for O
a O
dessert B-AS
pizza I-AS
. O

Once O
we O
sailed O
, O
the O
top O
- O
notch O
food B-AS
and O
live B-AS
entertainment I-AS
sold O
us O
on O
a O
unforgettable O
evening O
. O

Our O
waiter B-AS
was O
horrible O
; O
so O
rude O
and O
disinterested O
. O

The O
sangria B-AS
's O
, O
watered O
down O
. O

menu B-AS
, O
uneventful O
, O
small O
. O

Anytime O
and O
everytime O
I O
find O
myself O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
I O
will O
go O
to O
Sushi O
Rose O
for O
fresh O
sushi B-AS
and O
great O
portions B-AS
all O
at O
a O
reasonable O
price B-AS
. O

Great O
food B-AS
but O
the O
service B-AS
was O
dreadful O
! O

The O
portions B-AS
of I-AS
the I-AS
food I-AS
that O
came O
out O
were O
mediocre O
. O

the O
two O
waitress B-AS
's I-AS
looked O
like O
they O
had O
been O
sucking O
on O
lemons O
. O

From O
the O
beginning O
, O
we O
were O
met O
by O
friendly O
staff B-AS
memebers I-AS
, O
and O
the O
convienent O
parking B-AS
at O
Chelsea O
Piers O
made O
it O
easy O
for O
us O
to O
get O
to O
the O
boat O
. O

We O
enjoyed O
ourselves O
thoroughly O
and O
will O
be O
going O
back O
for O
the O
desserts B-AS
. O

Desserts B-AS
are O
almost O
incredible O
, O
my O
personal O
favorite O
is O
their O
Tart B-AS
of I-AS
the I-AS
Day I-AS
. O

I O
am O
surprised O
at O
the O
lower O
reviews O
because O
it O
is O
definitely O
better O
than O
other O
places O
I O
have O
tried O
with O
higher O
ratings O
. O

Maybe O
the O
secret O
was O
that O
we O
went O
on O
a O
Sunday O
night O
and O
everything O
was O
great O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
extremely O
tasty O
, O
creatively O
presented O
and O
the O
wine B-AS
excellent O
. O

WE O
ENDED O
UP O
IN O
LITTLE O
ITALY O
IN O
LATE O
AFTERNOON O
. O

WE O
WERE O
PLEASANTLY O
SURPRISED O
WITH O
OUR O
CHOICE O
. O

THE O
LASAGNA B-AS
WAS O
PROBABLY O
THE O
BEST O
I O
HAVE O
TASTED O
. O

Harumi O
Sushi O
has O
the O
freshest O
and O
most O
delicious O
array B-AS
of I-AS
sushi I-AS
in O
NYC O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
it O
for O
not O
just O
its O
superb O
cuisine B-AS
, O
but O
also O
for O
its O
friendly O
owners B-AS
and O
staff B-AS
. O

If O
you O
're O
craving O
some O
serious O
indian B-AS
food I-AS
and O
desire O
a O
cozy O
ambiance B-AS
, O
this O
is O
quite O
and O
exquisite O
choice O
. O

I O
definitely O
enjoyed O
the O
food B-AS
as O
well O
. O

have O
always O
had O
a O
great O
time O
here O
. O

It O
was O
pleasantly O
uncrowded O
, O
the O
service B-AS
was O
delightful O
, O
the O
garden B-AS
adorable O
, O
the O
food B-AS
from O
appetizers B-AS
to O
entrees B-AS
was O
delectable O
. O

You O
will O
be O
very O
happy O
with O
the O
experience O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
surprisingly O
good O
, O
and O
the O
decor B-AS
is O
nice O
. O

How O
pretentious O
and O
inappropriate O
for O
MJ O
Grill O
to O
claim O
that O
it O
provides O
power O
lunch B-AS
and O
dinners B-AS
! O

Two O
wasted O
steaks B-AS
- O
what O
a O
crime O
! O

The O
staff B-AS
should O
be O
a O
bit O
more O
friendly O
. O

I O
absolutely O
suggest O
this O
place O
. O

I O
think O
the O
meatball B-AS
parm I-AS
is O
good O
. O

If O
you O
want O
good O
tasting O
, O
well O
seasoned O
latin B-AS
food I-AS
eat O
at O
Cabana O
and O
you O
ca O
n't O
go O
wrong O
. O

Definitely O
try O
the O
taglierini B-AS
with I-AS
truffles I-AS
, O
it O
was O
incredible O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
staff B-AS
is O
very O
attentive O
and O
really O
personable O
. O

Overall O
, O
this O
is O
a O
great O
new O
restaurant O
that O
has O
been O
consistently O
good O
every O
time O
I O
have O
been O
. O

The O
gnocchi B-AS
literally O
melts O
in O
your O
mouth O
! O

Had O
a O
great O
experience O
at O
Trio O
staff B-AS
was O
pleasant O
; O
food B-AS
was O
tasty O
and O
large O
in O
portion B-AS
size I-AS
, O
I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
the O
portobello B-AS
/ I-AS
gorgonzola I-AS
/ I-AS
sausage I-AS
appetizer I-AS
and O
the O
lobster B-AS
risotto I-AS
. O

Entrees B-AS
include O
classics O
like O
lasagna B-AS
, O
fettuccine B-AS
Alfredo I-AS
and O
chicken B-AS
parmigiana I-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
good O
, O
the O
teriyaki B-AS
I O
recommend O
. O

Meal B-AS
was O
very O
expensive O
for O
what O
you O
get O
. O

Try O
the O
Peanut B-AS
Butter I-AS
Sorbet I-AS
and O
the O
pizza B-AS
with I-AS
soy I-AS
cheese I-AS
! O

Good O
food B-AS
at O
the O
right O
price B-AS
, O
what O
more O
can O
you O
ask O
for O
. O

We O
love O
it O
, O
and O
took O
buses O
and O
cabs O
to O
get O
there O
. O

If O
you O
re O
in O
New O
York O
, O
you O
do O
not O
want O
to O
miss O
this O
place O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
top O
notch O
, O
the O
service B-AS
is O
attentive O
, O
and O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
great O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
been O
coming O
here O
on O
and O
off O
for O
the O
past O
five O
years O
and O
I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
La O
Lanterna O
has O
never O
, O
ever O
dissapointed O
me O
. O

Great O
food B-AS
, O
great O
waitstaff B-AS
, O
great O
atmosphere B-AS
, O
and O
best O
of O
all O
GREAT O
beer B-AS
! O

this O
is O
still O
one O
of O
my O
most O
favorite O
restaurants O
in O
the O
area O
the O
food B-AS
is O
inexpensive O
but O
very O
good O
kimono B-AS
shrimp I-AS
special I-AS
was O
excellent O
and O
has O
a O
great O
atmosphere B-AS
. O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
moved O
to O
Nolita O
6 O
years O
ago O
and O
for O
as O
long O
as O
we O
have O
lived O
here O
, O
Peasant O
has O
been O
our O
favorite O
! O

The O
whole O
experience O
was O
satisfying O
. O

However O
, O
it O
was O
worth O
the O
visit O
. O

The O
menu B-AS
is O
interesting O
and O
quite O
reasonably O
priced B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
delicious O
and O
clearly O
fresh O
ingredients B-AS
were O
used O
. O

This O
made O
it O
obvious O
that O
the O
food B-AS
was O
n't O
cooked O
fresh O
; O
it O
was O
obviously O
made O
before O
hand O
and O
then O
reheated O
. O

Appetizer B-AS
are O
excellent O
here O
; O
you O
can O
make O
a O
great O
and O
inexpensive O
meal B-AS
out O
of O
them O
. O

The O
spicy B-AS
mussels I-AS
are O
a O
highlight O
. O

Also O
get O
the O
Onion B-AS
Rings I-AS
- O
best O
we O
' O
ve O
ever O
had O
. O

Would O
not O
return O
for O
the O
amount O
we O
paid O
. O

However O
, O
being O
food B-AS
, O
we O
were O
utterly O
disappointed O
with O
the O
food B-AS
. O

Huge O
portions B-AS
, O
great O
and O
attentive O
service B-AS
, O
and O
pretty O
good O
prices B-AS
. O

I O
was O
highly O
disappointed O
by O
their O
service B-AS
and O
food B-AS
. O

I O
complained O
to O
the O
waiter B-AS
and O
then O
to O
the O
manager B-AS
, O
but O
the O
intensity O
of O
rudeness O
from O
them O
just O
went O
up O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
great O
and O
the O
milkshakes B-AS
are O
even O
better O
! O

Stay O
away O
if O
you O
're O
claustrophobic O

If O
you O
're O
in O
the O
hood O
, O
definitely O
stop O
in O
. O

the O
mushroom B-AS
barley I-AS
soup I-AS
is O
amazing O
. O

On O
the O
recommendation O
of O
a O
friend O
, O
I O
checked O
out O
Arezzo O
with O
my O
wife O
. O

I O
' O
m O
glad O
I O
did O
as O
the O
food B-AS
was O
very O
good O
and O
the O
staff B-AS
was O
friendly O
, O
courteous O
and O
efficient O
. O

Their O
duck B-AS
here O
is O
also O
absolutely O
delicious O
. O

This O
is O
definitely O
one O
of O
the O
places O
that O
I O
have O
continued O
to O
come O
back O
to O
over O
the O
years O
. O

While O
it O
was O
large O
and O
a O
bit O
noisy O
, O
the O
drinks B-AS
were O
fantastic O
, O
and O
the O
food B-AS
was O
superb O
. O

One O
caveat O
, O
Some O
of O
the O
curried B-AS
casseroles I-AS
can O
be O
a O
trifle O
harsh O
. O

I O
was O
n't O
impressed O
and O
it O
was O
n't O
SPICEY O
? O
? O
? O
? O

The O
food B-AS
was O
almost O
always O
EXCELLENT O
. O

I O
was O
pleasently O
surprised O
at O
the O
taste B-AS
. O

A O
nice O
space O
, O
as O
long O
as O
it O
does O
n't O
get O
too O
crowded O
and O
a O
singleminded O
devotion O
to O
its O
chosen O
cuisine B-AS
make O
Mare O
a O
great O
choice O
for O
seafood B-AS
lovers O
. O

I O
never O
had O
an O
orange B-AS
donut I-AS
before O
so O
I O
gave O
it O
a O
shot O
. O

they O
really O
provide O
a O
relaxing O
, O
laid O
- O
back O
atmosphere B-AS
. O

This O
particular O
location O
certainly O
uses O
substandard O
meats B-AS
. O

I O
stumbled O
upon O
this O
resteraunt O
on O
my O
way O
home O
from O
the O
subway O
. O

The O
Management B-AS
was O
less O
than O
accomodating O
. O

The O
ambience B-AS
is O
also O
more O
laid O
- O
back O
and O
relaxed O
. O

the O
teas B-AS
are O
great O
and O
all O
the O
sweets B-AS
are O
homemade O
. O

mojitos B-AS
and O
the O
service B-AS
are O
the O
best O
part O
in O
there O

Sandwiches B-AS
, O
burgers B-AS
and O
salads B-AS
, O
like O
the O
lemon B-AS
- I-AS
dressed I-AS
cobb I-AS
, O
are O
classic O
successes O
. O

this O
restaurant O
is O
absolutely O
beautiful O
. O

The O
design B-AS
is O
very O
intimate O
and O
romantic O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
wonderful O
and O
imaginative O
. O

The O
staff B-AS
is O
very O
sharp O
and O
they O
look O
good O
too O
. O

The O
worst O
though O
was O
the O
taste B-AS
. O

They O
were O
dry O
, O
stale O
and O
pretty O
flavorless O
. O

The O
fajita B-AS
we O
tried O
was O
tasteless O
and O
burned O
and O
the O
mole B-AS
sauce I-AS
was O
way O
too O
sweet O
. O

Stay O
with O
the O
roasted B-AS
chickens I-AS
and O
you O
'll O
be O
fine O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
warm O
, O
comfortable O
, O
artsy O
and O
sexy O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
great O
big O
selection B-AS
, O
reasonable O
prices B-AS
and O
the O
drinks B-AS
are O
really O
good O
. O

The O
steak B-AS
melted O
in O
my O
mouth O
. O

The O
food B-AS
did O
take O
a O
few O
extra O
minutes O
to O
come O
, O
but O
the O
cute O
waiters B-AS
jokes O
and O
friendliness O
made O
up O
for O
it O
. O

Most O
importantly O
, O
it O
is O
reasonably O
priced B-AS
. O

The O
selection B-AS
of I-AS
food I-AS
is O
excellent O
I O
' O
m O
not O
used O
to O
having O
much O
choice O
at O
restaurants O
, O
and O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
great O
. O

Only O
suggestion O
is O
that O
you O
skip O
the O
dessert B-AS
, O
it O
was O
overpriced O
and O
fell O
short O
on O
taste B-AS
. O

Food B-AS
was O
decent O
, O
but O
not O
great O
. O

I O
have O
no O
idea O
why O
this O
restaurant O
is O
so O
often O
overlooked O
. O

From O
the O
moment O
you O
walk O
in O
, O
you O
feel O
like O
you O
're O
in O
the O
perfect O
place O
. O

i O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
some O
people O
who O
rave O
about O
this O
hot B-AS
dog I-AS
are O
talking O
about O
. O

it O
is O
a O
hidden O
delight O
complete O
with O
a O
quaint O
bar B-AS
and O
good O
food B-AS
. O

I O
find O
that O
most O
Kosher O
restaurants O
are O
average O
to O
good O
, O
but O
this O
has O
been O
the O
best O
I O
' O
ve O
eaten O
so O
far O
. O

The O
waiters B-AS
ALWAYS O
look O
angry O
and O
even O
ignore O
their O
high O
- O
tipping O
regulars O
. O

the O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
very O
nice O
, O
and O
a O
welcome O
escape O
from O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
SI O
mall O
. O

Yes O
, O
they O
're O
a O
bit O
more O
expensive O
then O
typical O
, O
but O
then O
again O
, O
so O
is O
their O
food B-AS
. O

Not O
terrible O
, O
but O
not O
the O
restaurant O
in O
the O
reviews O
of O
2002 O
. O

I O
can O
say O
that O
the O
wraps B-AS
, O
burgers B-AS
and O
salads B-AS
were O
all O
fresh O
, O
tasty O
and O
the O
mango B-AS
margareta I-AS
at O
$ O
9 O
was O
WELL O
WORTH O
the O
money O
. O

It O
was O
delicious O
and O
large O
! O

Anywhere O
else O
, O
the O
prices B-AS
would O
be O
3x O
as O
high O
! O

The O
service B-AS
we O
experienced O
was O
friendly O
and O
good O
. O

Our O
waiter B-AS
was O
friendly O
and O
it O
is O
a O
shame O
that O
he O
did O
n't O
have O
a O
supportive O
staff B-AS
to O
work O
with O
. O

The O
folding B-AS
chair I-AS
I O
was O
seated O
at O
was O
uncomfortable O
. O

As O
we O
waited O
I O
watched O
3 O
seperate O
groups O
of O
diners O
discuss O
how O
dissapointed O
they O
also O
were O
. O

An O
excellent O
choice O
in O
midtown O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
among O
the O
best O
I O
have O
ever O
had O
in O
NYC O
. O

The O
fettucino B-AS
alfredo I-AS
was O
amazing O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
very O
good O
and O
I O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised O
to O
see O
so O
many O
vegan B-AS
options I-AS
. O

I O
know O
real O
Indian B-AS
food I-AS
and O
this O
was O
n't O
it O
. O

Be O
sure O
to O
try O
the O
Smoked B-AS
Trout I-AS
, O
Veal B-AS
Chops I-AS
, O
Rabbit B-AS
, O
the O
potato B-AS
gratin I-AS
, O
on O
and O
on O
and O
on O
. O

Even O
when O
the O
chef B-AS
is O
not O
in O
the O
house O
, O
the O
food B-AS
and O
service B-AS
are O
right O
on O
target O
. O

Everything O
from O
the O
eggs B-AS
benedict I-AS
to O
the O
mussels B-AS
and O
even O
the O
hamburger B-AS
were O
done O
well O
and O
very O
tasty O
. O

The O
waiters B-AS
were O
very O
professional O
, O
courteous O
and O
attentive O
. O

My O
boyfriend O
and O
I O
went O
here O
last O
night O
and O
LOVED O
it O
! O

The O
falafal B-AS
was O
rather O
over O
cooked O
and O
dried O
but O
the O
chicken B-AS
was O
fine O
. O

I O
highly O
reccomend O
the O
grand B-AS
marnier I-AS
shrimp I-AS
, O
it O
's O
insanely O
good O
. O

there O
and O

good O
. O

Desserts B-AS
include O
flan B-AS

sopaipillas B-AS
. O

I O
was O
starving O
and O
the O
small O
portions B-AS
were O
driving O
me O
crazy O
! O

The O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
was O
loud O
and O
inconsiderate O
. O

However O
, O
the O
food B-AS
and O
service B-AS
and O
dramatically O
lacking O
. O

The O
sushi B-AS
is O
cut O
in O
blocks O
bigger O
than O
my O
cell O
phone O
. O

The O
service B-AS
is O
great O
, O
my O
soup B-AS
always O
arrives O
nice O
and O
hot O
. O

It O
had O
been O
awhile O
and O
I O
forgot O
just O
how O
delicious O
crepes B-AS
can O
be O
. O

Montparnasse O

desserts B-AS
-- O
especially O
the O
silken O
creme B-AS
brulee I-AS
and O
paper O
- O
thin O
apple B-AS
tart I-AS
-- O
are O
good O
enough O
on O
their O
own O
to O
make O
the O
restaurant O
worth O
the O
trip O
. O

My O
friend O
told O
me O
about O
this O
restaurant O
for O
a O
year O
before O

. O

The O

unless O
you O
want O
to O
call O
the O

mouth O
. O

The O
decor B-AS
is O
designed O
in O
a O
contemporary O
Japanese O
style O
restaurant O
. O

but O
the O
food B-AS
was O
delicious O
. O

Try O
the O
ribs B-AS
, O
sizzling O
beef B-AS
and O
couple O
it O
with O
coconut B-AS
rice I-AS
. O

The O
only O
drawback O
is O
that O
it O
's O
a O
little O
pricey O
. O

Everything O
about O
this O
place O
was O
wonderful O

The O

The O

is O
attractive O
, O
but O
a O
little O
uncomfortable O
. O

The O
staff B-AS
is O
very O
friendly O
. O

Waiters B-AS

Tiny O

be O
for O
everyone O
, O
since O

My O
husband O

been O
there O

6 O
times O

I O
recently O
visited O
over O
this O
past O
summer O
after O
being O
away O
for O
a O
year O
. O

What O
a O
difference O
, O
the O
service B-AS
was O
very O
comforting O
and O
the O
food B-AS
was O
better O
than O
average O
, O
but O
what O
really O
standed O
out O
was O
such O
a O
dynamic O
and O
extensive O
beer B-AS
list I-AS
. O

Frankly O
, O
the O
chinese B-AS
food I-AS
here O
is O
something O
I O
can O
make O
better O
at O
home O
. O

There O
was O
only O
one O
waiter B-AS
for O
the O
whole O
restaurant O
upstairs O
. O

We O
started O
with O
the O
scallops B-AS
and O
asparagus B-AS
and O
also O
had O
the O
soft B-AS
shell I-AS
crab I-AS
as O
well O
as O
the O
cheese B-AS
plate I-AS
. O

Not O
to O
be O
overlooked O
, O
the O
service B-AS
is O
excellent O
. O

this O
without O
question O
is O
one O
of O
the O
worst O
hotdogs B-AS
i O

had O
. O

The O

is O
unbelievably O
friendly O

the O
best O
pizza B-AS
. O

Culinaria O
is O
a O
welcome O
addition O
to O
the O
Garment O
district O
far O
better O
than O
any O
restaurant O
in O
the O
area O
. O

The O
music B-AS
which O
is O
sometimes O
a O
little O
too O
heavy O
for O
my O
taste O
. O

The O
service B-AS
is O
excellent O
and O
always O
informative O
without O
an O
air O
. O

The O
owner B-AS
and O
staff B-AS
go O
to O
great O
lengths O
to O
make O
you O
feel O
comfortable O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
stand O
this O
dungeon O
. O

The O
sushi B-AS
is O
always O
fresh O
and O
yummy O
and O

varied O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
great O
, O
sushi B-AS
was O
good O
, O
but O
the O
cooked O
food B-AS
amazed O
us O
. O

their O

to O
your O
liking O
! O

Great O
food B-AS

great O

For O
the O
price B-AS
you O
pay O
for O
the O
food B-AS
here O
, O
you O
'd O
expect O
it O
to O
be O
at O
least O
on O
par O
with O
other O
Japanese O
restaurants O
. O

Food B-AS
portion I-AS
was O
SMALL O
and O
below O
average O
. O

Do O
yourself O
a O
favor O
and O
avoid O
this O
place O
at O
ALL O
COST O
! O

since O
the O

one O
of O
the O
only O
places O
worthy O
of O

so O
if O
you O
happen O

The O
bartenders B-AS

really O
nice O
and O
the O
decor B-AS
is O
very O
comfy O
and O
laid O
- O
back O
, O
all O
the O
while O
being O
trendy O
. O

For O
a O
savory O
take O
on O
the O
soup B-AS
and I-AS
sandwich I-AS
meal I-AS
, O
try O
the O
hot B-AS

This O

it O
all O
, O
great O
drinks B-AS

, O
the O

of O
the O

obnoxious O
smirks O

and O
snotty O

How O

looking O
to O
impress O
someone O
. O

We O
ordered O
lamb B-AS

. O

And O
as O
SOON O
as O
one O
person O
is O
done O
, O
she O
asked O
to O
pick O
up O
the O
plate O
immediately O
. O

This O
place O
is O
Italian O
, O
not O
French O
. O

After O
so O
many O
great O
reviews O
here O
, O
my O
bf O
and O
I O
went O
to O
Esca O
to O
celebrate O
my O
birthday O
last O
nite O
. O

While O
their O
kitchen B-AS
food I-AS
is O
delicious O
, O
their O
Sushi B-AS
is O
out O
of O
this O
world O
. O

There O
was O
a O
heat O
problem O
to O
boot O
, O
so O
it O
was O
about O
40 O
degrees O
in O
the O
restaurant O
- O
we O
had O
to O
request O
to O
uncheck O
our O
coats O
! O

everything O
is O
scrumptious O
, O
from O
the O
excellent O
service B-AS
by O
cute O
waitresses B-AS
, O
to O
the O
extremely O
lush O
atmosphere B-AS
. O

It O
's O
traditional O
, O
simple O
italian B-AS
food I-AS
. O

My O
girlfriend O
and O
I O
just O
spent O
our O
10 O
month O
anniversary O
at O
Lou O
Lou O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
all O
- O
around O
good O
, O
with O
the O
rolls B-AS
usually O
excellent O
and O
the O
sushi B-AS
/ I-AS
sashimi I-AS
not O
quite O
on O
the O
same O
level O
. O

The O
sashimi B-AS
is O
cut O
a O
little O
thinly O
. O

Bay O
Terrace O
mall O
is O
nothing O
ok O
, O
almost O
nothing O
without O
it O
! O

Could O
have O
had O
better O
for O
1/3 O
the O
price B-AS
in O
Chinatown O
. O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
had O
a O
blast O
. O

personally O
i O
say O
save O
your O
money O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
great O
hot B-AS
dogs I-AS
, O
DOTP O
has O
wonderful O
breakfast B-AS
sandwiches I-AS
that O
feature O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
great O
things O
like O
tator B-AS
tots I-AS
and O
English B-AS
muffins I-AS
, O
a O
delicious O
NJ O
- O
based O
pork B-AS
product I-AS
know O
to O
us O
Jersey O
girls O
and O
boys O
as O
Taylor B-AS
ham I-AS
. O

Believe O
me O
, O
they O
live O
up O
to O
the O
name O
. O

Well O
, O
it O
happened O
because O
of O
a O
graceless O
manager B-AS
and O
a O
rude O
bartender B-AS
who O
had O
us O
waiting B-AS
20 O
minutes O
for O
drinks B-AS
, O
and O
then O
tells O
us O
to O
chill O
out O
. O

Not O
only O
is O
the O
service B-AS
great O
, O
but O
forming O
conversation O
around O
a O
table O
is O
so O
easy O
beacuse O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
can O
be O
both O
romantic O
and O
comfortable O
. O

When O
the O
dish B-AS
arrived O
it O
was O
blazing O
with O
green B-AS
chillis I-AS
, O
definitely O
not O
edible O
by O
a O
human O
. O

The O
absolute O
worst O
service B-AS
I O
' O
ve O
ever O
experienced O
and O
the O
food B-AS
was O
below O
average O
when O
they O
actually O
gave O
people O
the O
meals B-AS
they O
ordered O
. O

It O
's O
about O
$ O
7 O
for O
lunch B-AS
and O
they O
have O
take B-AS
- I-AS
out I-AS
or O
dine B-AS
- I-AS
in I-AS
. O

They O
are O
by O
far O
the O
BEST O
past O
in O
New O
York O
. O

I O
have O
eaten O
here O
several O
times O
before O
attending O
an O
afternoon O
performance O
. O

Everything O
is O
very O
cheap O
. O

Be O
sure O
to O
accompany O
your O
food B-AS
with O
one O
of O
their O
fresh B-AS
juice I-AS
concoctions I-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
great O
and O
the O
prices B-AS
are O
reasonable O
. O

The O
place B-AS
is O
clean O
, O
and O
if O
you O
like O
soul B-AS
food I-AS
, O
then O
this O
is O
the O
place B-AS
to O
be O
! O

You O
'll O
see O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
eating O
there O
after O
church O
. O

I O
had O
roast B-AS
chicken I-AS
and O
a O
salad B-AS
. O

I O
' O
ve O
been O
a O
regular O
customer O
at O
Juice O
Generation O
for O
the O
last O
3 O
months O
, O
my O
office O
moved O
to O
the O
Film O
Center O
on O
Ninth O
Avenue O
and O
they O
are O
on O
the O
next O
block O
. O

They O
have O
a O
very O
good O
chicken B-AS
with I-AS
avocado I-AS
and O
good O
tuna B-AS
as O
well O
. O

It O
's O
the O
kind O
of O
place O
I O
like O
to O
support O
! O

But O
the O
meals B-AS
were O
terrible O
. O

My O
chicken B-AS
was O
completely O
dried O
out O
and O
on O
the O
cold O
side O
and O
the O
sauce B-AS
was O
not O
very O
flavorful O
. O

Malted B-AS
Milk I-AS
Ball I-AS
Gelato I-AS
, O
have O
you O
ever O
in O
your O
life O
heard O
of O
anything O
so O
ridiculously O
wonderful O
? O

just O
walk O
by O
the O
window O
and O
see O
all O
the O
unbiased O
positive O
reviews O
in O
all O
the O
major O
nyc O
publications O
. O

Way O
too O
much O
money O
for O
such O
a O
terrible O
meal B-AS
. O

Would O
not O
recommend O
anyone O
to O
go O
. O

However O
, O
the O
service B-AS
is O
absolutely O
horrible O
. O

A O
con O
was O
the O
slow O
bar B-AS
service I-AS
. O

Dessert B-AS
was O
also O
to O
die O
for O
! O

BTW O
, O
the O
service B-AS
is O
very O
good O
. O

We O
loved O
it O
and O
will O
go O
back O
! O

I O
came O
again O
weeks O
later O
with O
my O
boyfriend O
and O
again O
had O
a O
very O
nice O
experience O
. O

It O
's O
eaten O
with O
black B-AS
vinegar I-AS
and O
shredded B-AS
ginger I-AS
. O

The O
unattractive O
lighting B-AS
made O
me O
want O
to O
gag O
, O
the O
food B-AS
was O
overpriced O
, O
there O
was O
the O
most O
awful O
disco B-AS
pop I-AS
duo I-AS
performing O
- O
and O
my O
escargot B-AS
looked O
like O
it O
might O
crawl O
off O
the O
plate O
. O

We O
'll O
definitly O
be O
back O
again O
! O

This O
is O
the O
best O
Italian O
restaurant O
in O
the O
city O
. O

it O
is O
a O
cozy O
place B-AS
to O
go O
with O
a O
couple O
of O
friends O
. O

The O
service B-AS
is O
always O
great O
, O
and O
the O
owner B-AS
walks O
around O
to O
make O
sure O
you O
enjoy O
. O

because O
the O
waiters B-AS
need O
SEVERE O
ATTITUE O
ADJUSTMENTS O
. O

There O
are O
numerous O
shavue O
restaurants O
in O
LA O
, O
but O
few O
out O
here O
. O

Horrible O
experience O
, O
stay O
away O
! O

If O
this O
restaurant O
was O
in O
Manhattan O
, O
I O
would O
definitely O
go O
more O
often O
. O

the O
food B-AS
is O
delicious O
and O
highly O
recommended O
. O

When O
it O
came O
time O
to O
take O
the O
order O
the O
waiter B-AS
gave O
us O
a O
hard O
time O
, O
walked O
away O
then O
came O
back O
with O
a O
paper O
and O
pen O
for O
us O
to O
write O
down O
what O
we O
wantedexcuse O
me O

All O
I O
can O

they O
are O
fantastic O
. O

Dieters O

to O
salads B-AS

a O
filling O

healthy O
meal B-AS
give O

ca O
n't O

Since O

living O
, O
I O
' O
m O
very O
fussy O
about O
the O
food B-AS
I O
eat O
in O
restaurants O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
outstanding O
. O

I O
went O
for O
restaurant O
week O
. O

My O
friends O
and O
I O
stop O
here O
for O
pizza B-AS
before O
hitting O
the O
Kips O
Bay O
movie O
theater O
. O

We O
always O
enjoy O
the O
pizza B-AS

The O

is O
pretty O
good O
. O

I O
went O
there O
with O
a O
few O
friends O

This O
place O
has O
been O
around O

highly O
recommend O
this O
restaurant O
! O
! O

You O
will O
find O
everything O
about O
Trio O
to O
your O
liking O
! O

This O
place O
was O
the O
worst O
. O

I O
ordered O
from O
here O
last O
week O
. O

This O
is O
a O
nice O
sushi O
restaurant O
in O
Brooklyn O
that O
's O
located O
on O
86 O
street O
, O
right O
underneath O
the O
train O
station O
. O

The O
food B-AS
here O
was O
great O
, O
a O
treat O
from O
beginning O
to O
end O
. O

The O
host B-AS
( I-AS
owner I-AS
) I-AS
and O
servers B-AS
are O
personable O
and O
caring O
. O

I O
decided O
to O
try O
out O
this O
place O
after O
hearing O
about O
it O
in O
many O
magazines O
. O

It O
's O
just O
everythingthe O
food B-AS
, O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
incrediby O
kind O
and O
gracious O
hostess B-AS
. O

Having O
moved O
I O
truly O
miss O
this O
place O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
very O
good O
and O
the O
service B-AS
is O
great O
. O

I O
usually O
get O
one O
the O
Vietnamese B-AS
Beef I-AS
Noodle I-AS
Soup I-AS
. O

SUM O
IT O
, O
local O
investment O
bankers O
like O
it O
, O
try O
for O
yourself O
at O
least O
once O
. O

I O
started O
going O
to O
dosa O
hut O
more O
after O
that O
. O

We O
were O
wondering O
why O
they O
were O
there O
to O
make O
our O
dining B-AS
experience I-AS
miserable O
? O

Too O
bad O
, O
has O
a O
lot O
of O
potential O
. O

This O
place O
has O
the O
best O
Indian B-AS
food I-AS
in O
New O
York O
, O
hands O
down O
. O

The O
waiters B-AS
are O
very O
friendly O
and O
helpful O
and O
if O
you O
frequent O
they O
will O
remember O
you O
. O

Intimate O
but O
charming O
interior B-AS
with O
extremely O
friendly O
and O
attentive O
service B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
as O
creative O
as O
the O
decor B-AS
and O
both O
worked O
. O

Siam O
Square O
is O
fairly O
new O
to O
the O
neighborhood O
and O
I O
think O
in O
time O
will O
gain O
the O
recognition O
it O
deserves O
. O

My O
first O
experience O
at O
Siam O
Square O
was O
very O
pleasant O
. O

I O
have O
gone O
back O
to O
Siam O
Square O
many O
times O
since O
and O
everytime O
I O
am O
very O
satisfied O
overall O
. O

The O
menu B-AS
is O
great O
, O
with O
a O
good O
selection B-AS
, O
and O
everything O
that O
I O
have O
tried O
is O
absolutely O
delicious O
. O

We O
had O
our O
Christmas O
party O
at O
Dos O
Caminos O
and O
it O
was O
wonderful O
. O

My O
personal O
favorite O
is O
Nick O
and O
Joe O
's O
. O

The O
sauce B-AS
is O
zesty O
and O
flavorful O
and O
the O
crust B-AS
is O
nice O
and O
crispy O
. O

This O
place O
has O
the O
best O
sushi B-AS
in O
the O
city O
. O

They O
have O
an O
excellent O
selection B-AS
the O
rolls B-AS
with I-AS
crab I-AS
are O
really O
great O
. O

Everyone O
who O
works O
there O
the O
host B-AS
, O
the O
bartender B-AS
, O
the O
servers B-AS
is O
so O
helpful O
. O

And O
the O
food B-AS
is O
fantastic O
. O

Favourites O
include O
, O
potato B-AS
spinach I-AS
gnocchi I-AS
and O
the O
lamb B-AS
. O

Another O
great O
thing O
about O
Glechik O
- O
everything O
is O
very O
cheap O
! O

Unfortunately O
, O
we O
chose O
this O
spot O
for O
lunch B-AS
as O
we O
had O
done O
a O
lot O
of O
walking O
and O
ended O
up O
at O
the O
South O
St O
Seaport O
. O

But O
regulars O
know O
that O
the O
sandwiches B-AS
are O
the O
real O
star O
here O
. O

The O
skillfully O
chosen O
Portuguese B-AS
cheese I-AS
cart I-AS
paired O
with O
quality O
port B-AS
provides O
the O
perfect O
Iberian O
ending O
. O

My O
friend O
had O
a O
burger B-AS
and O
I O
had O
these O
wonderful O
blueberry B-AS
pancakes I-AS
. O

We O
were O
so O
happy O
with O
our O
food B-AS
and O
were O
even O
more O
thrilled O
when O
we O
saw O
the O
bill B-AS
. O

I O
would O
definitely O
come O
back O
to O
this O
restaurant O
. O

The O
place O
just O
is O
n't O
ready O
for O
prime O
time O
. O

All O
toppings B-AS
are O
so O
fresh O
you O
'd O
think O
they O
had O
their O
own O
vegetable O
garden O
and O
the O
crust B-AS
is O
so O
perfect O
, O
that O
one O
actually O
thinks O
of O
how O
it O
was O
made O
. O

Quartino O
is O
my O
favoriate O
resturant O
in O
NYC O
. O

We O
' O
ve O
always O
gotten O
amazing O
service B-AS
and O
we O
love O
the O
food B-AS
. O

The O
waitstaff B-AS
is O
solicitous O
and O
friendly O
and O
always O
seems O
glad O
to O
see O
us O
, O
and O
the O
food B-AS
is O
wonderful O
, O
if O
not O
stunningly O
creative O
. O

I O
' O
m O
in O
love O
with O
the O
lobster B-AS
ravioli I-AS
! O

My O
order O
is O
on O
my O
table O
even O
on O
a O
busy O
friday O
night O
within O
10 O
minutes O
at O
the O
most O
of O
hanging O
up O
the O
phone O
. O

We O
came O
across O
this O
restaurant O
by O
accident O
while O
at O
a O
DUMBO O
art O
festival O
and O
thoroughly O
enjoyed O
our O
meal B-AS
. O

Service B-AS
is O
excellent O
, O
no O
wait B-AS
, O
and O
you O
get O
a O
lot O
for O
the O
price B-AS
. O

I O
thought O
the O
food B-AS
is O
n't O
cheap O
at O
all O
compared O
to O
Chinatown O
. O

And O
you O
never O
get O
the O
feeling O
that O
you O
need O
to O
leave O
. O

Coffee B-AS
is O
a O
better O
deal O
than O
overpriced O
Cosi B-AS
sandwiches I-AS
. O

We O
did O
n't O
know O
if O
we O
should O
order O
a O
drink B-AS
or O
leave O
? O

great O
neighbhorhood O
spot O
. O

Bobb O
V O
's O
is O
a O
great O
place O
to O
take O
your O
Friends O
and O
Family O
! O

It O
's O
not O
the O
best O
Japanese O
restaurant O
in O
the O
East O
Village O
, O
but O
it O
's O
a O
pretty O
solid O
one O
for O
its O
modest O
prices B-AS
, O
and O
worth O
repeat O
visits O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
so O
good O
and O
so O
popular O
that O
waiting B-AS
can O
really O
be O
a O
nightmare O
. O

Here O
's O
the O
thing O
, O
you O
're O
in O
the O
best O
city O
in O
the O
world O
for O
restaurants O
. O

Go O
spend O
your O
money O
somewhere O
that O
really O
wows O
you O
. O

The O
crowd O
was O
older O
and O
the O
restaurant O
is O
very O
cramped O
, O
but O
it O
has O
old O
school O
charm O
. O

This O
is O
a O
real O
gem O
of O
a O
place O
. O

I O
think O
this O
a O
a O
wonderful O
place O
. O

First O
walking O
in O
the O
place B-AS
seemed O
to O
have O
great O
ambience B-AS
. O

I O
went O
to O
Kitchenette O
this O
weekend O
for O
brunch B-AS
. O

This O
place O
does O
n't O
get O
the O
publicity O
that O
Sylvias O
Soul O
Food O
restaurant O
does O
, O
but O
it O
should O
. O

Just O
because O
P O
Diddy O
had O
a O
party O
at O
Butter O
does O
n't O
mean O
we O
should O
be O
automatically O
impressed O
. O

Even O
for O
two O
very O
hungry O
people O
there O
is O
plenty O
of O
food B-AS
left O
to O
be O
taken O
home O
it O
reheats O
really O
well O
also O
. O

Like O
I O
said O
, O
Nick O
and O
Joe O
's O
may O
not O
be O
everyone O
's O
favorite O
, O
but O
it O
's O
mine O
. O

The O
help O
was O
extremely O
nice O
and O
did O
not O
rush O
us O
. O

Then O
they O
somehow O
made O
a O
dry O
and O
burnt O
crust B-AS
, O
around O
a O
raw O
and O
cold O
inside O
. O

It O
's O
just O
good O
food B-AS
, O
nothing O
more O
and O
that O
's O
all O
we O
want O
! O

DO O
N'T O
KNOW O
WHAT O
THE O
OTHERS O
ON O
THE O
BLOCK O
WERE O
LIKE O
BUT O
WE O
WERE O
PLEASED O
WITH O
OUR O
CHOICE O
. O

Average O
cake B-AS
that O
s O
been O
courted O
by O
a O
LOT O
of O
hype O
. O

It O
's O
cute O
and O
simple O
and O
I O
loved O
it O
. O

My O
wife O
and O
I O
recently O
visited O
the O
bistro O
for O
dinner B-AS
and O
had O
a O
wonderful O
experience O
. O

THE O

. O

Everytime O
I O
go O
there O
I O
ca O
n't O
pick O
anything O

with O
great O
things O
to O
eat O
. O

Half O
a O

a O

. O

The O
service B-AS
is O
really O
fast O

inexpensive O
. O

Even O

a O
few O
bad O
evenings O
at O
Bardolino O
, O
I O
keep O
coming O
back O
. O

The O
pizza B-AS
's I-AS
are O
made O
fresh O
, O
crispy O
, O
and O
ready O
to O
serve O
. O

There O
are O
many O
french O
bistros O
in O
the O
midtown O
area O
, O
and O
I O
wholheartedly O
recommend O
this O
one O
. O

Staff B-AS
is O
accomodating O
make O
sure O
you O
are O
satified O
. O

Chef B-AS
Waldy O
's O
always O
measures O
up O
. O

This O
diamond O
in O
the O
ruff O
is O
definitely O
worth O
my O
10-minute O
walk O
from O
the O
6 O
train O
. O

Being O
a O
vegan O
myself O
, O
I O
' O
ve O
made O
a O
point O
of O
trying O
all O
the O
vegan O
restaurants O
in O
Manhattan O
-- O
and O
Zen O
Palate O
is O
easily O
my O
favorite O

one O
of O
my O
favorite O

. O

Reasonably O

All O
of O
the O
apetizers B-AS
are O
good O
and O
the O
Sangria B-AS
is O
very O
good O
. O

Cantinetta O
is O
a O
real O
treasure O
in O
a O
see O
of O
mediocre O
Italian O
restaurants O
. O

The O
one O
positive O
thing O
I O
can O
say O
is O
that O
the O
service B-AS
was O
prompt O
, O
we O
got O
seated O
right O
away O
and O
the O
server B-AS
was O
very O
friendly O
. O

The O
staff B-AS
greeted O
me O
warmly O
at O
the O
door O
and O
I O
was O
seated O
promptly O
and O
the O
food B-AS
was O
excellent O
. O

Whether O
one O
pizza O
place O
is O
better O
than O
another O
is O
often O
very O
subjective O
. O

Really O
nice O
restaurant O
to O
go O
with O
a O
group O
or O
on O
a O
date O
. O

Service B-AS
is O
usually O
pretty O
good O
. O

Host B-AS
and O
Host B-AS
was O
quite O
rude O
. O

You O
will O
not O
be O
missing O
anything O
. O

I O
discovered O
Applebees O
when O
I O
went O
away O
to O

the O

staff I-AS
is O
very O

if O
your O
not O
rude O
or O
pickyour O
meal B-AS
at O
Leon O
last O
weekend O
was O
great O
- O
. O

I O
recommend O
any O
of O
their O
salmon B-AS
dishes I-AS
. O

The O
foie B-AS
gras I-AS
was O
sweet O
and O
luscious O
. O

The O
menu B-AS
, O
which O
changes O
seasonally O
, O
shows O
both O
regional O
and O
international O
influences O
. O

but O
their O
mac B-AS
cheese I-AS
was O
YUMMY O
! O

their O
brunch B-AS
menu I-AS
had O
something O
for O
everyone O
. O

jazz B-AS
singer I-AS
had O
a O

made O
us O
all O
get O
up O
to O
dance O
to O
shake O
some O
cals O
to O
eat O
some O
more O
. O

I O
often O
find O
myself O
with O
time O
to O
kill O
in O
Times O
Square O
, O
which O
is O
a O
shame O
since O
I O
do O
n't O
love O
this O
area O
. O

They O
have O
very O
quick O
service B-AS
which O
is O
great O
when O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
much O
time O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
average O
, O
breakfast O
food B-AS
, O
soups B-AS
, O
salads B-AS
, O
sandwiches B-AS
, O

. O

I O
WAS O
HIGHLY O
DISAPPOINTED O
BY O
THE O
FOOD B-AS
. O

THE O
BANANA B-AS
PUDDING I-AS
THEY O
SERVE O

ON O
THE O
VERY O
GREASY O
MAC B-AS
AND I-AS
CHEESE I-AS
. O

The O
staff B-AS
is O
arrogant O
, O
the O
prices B-AS
are O
way O
high O
for O
Brooklyn O
. O

This O
place O
is O
average O
at O
best O
. O

the O
service B-AS
is O
prompt O
friendly O
. O

Whatever O
the O
reason O
it O
is O
definitely O
the O
place O
to O
be O
. O

This O
is O
literally O
a O
hot O
spot O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
the O
food B-AS
. O

The O
downstairs B-AS
bar I-AS
scene I-AS
is O
very O
cool O
and O
chill O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
definitely O
good O
, O
but O
when O
all O
was O
said O
and O
done O
, O
I O
just O
could O
n't O
justify O
it O
for O
the O
price B-AS
including O
2 O
drinks B-AS
, O
$ O
100 O
/ O
person O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
come O
here O
for O

as O
for O
a O
friend O

birthday O
and O
I O
always O
enjoy O
myself O
. O

If O
you O
are O
a O
Tequila B-AS
fan O
you O
will O
not O
be O
disappointed O
. O

Great O
beer B-AS
selection I-AS
too O
, O
something O
like O
50 O
beers B-AS
. O

After O
reading O
the O
great O
reviews O
, O
I O
invited O
a O
die O
- O
hard O
downtown O
friend O
of O
mine O
to O
join O
me O
at O
TASTE O
. O

Not O
to O
sound O
too O
negative O
but O
be O
wary O
of O
the O
delivary B-AS
. O

Feels O
like O
family O
when O
we O
go O
there O
. O

I O
found O
the O
food B-AS
to O
be O
just O
as O
good O
as O
its O
owner B-AS
, O
Da O
Silvano O
, O
just O
much O
less O
expensive O
. O

They O
have O
homemade B-AS
pastas I-AS
of O
all O
kinds O
- O
I O
recommend O
the O
gnocchi B-AS
- O
yum O
! O

My O
vegetable B-AS
risotto I-AS
was O
burnt O
, O
and O
infused O
totally O
in O
a O
burnt O
flavor B-AS
. O

What O
a O
pleasant O
surprise O
! O

The O
main O
draw O
of O
this O
place O
is O
the O
price B-AS
. O

How O
can O
hope O
to O
stay O
in O
business O
with O
service B-AS
like O
this O
? O

But O
dinner B-AS
here O
is O
never O
disappointing O
, O
even O
if O
the O
prices B-AS
are O
a O
bit O
over O
the O
top O
. O

Not O
only O
did O
they O
have O
amazing O
, O
sandwiches B-AS
, O
soup B-AS
, O
pizza B-AS
etc O
, O
but O
their O
homemade B-AS
sorbets I-AS
are O
out O
of O
this O
world O
! O

the O
homemade B-AS
Guacamole I-AS
, O
the O
unbelievable O
entree B-AS
, O
and O
thee O
most O
amazing O
deserts B-AS
. O

The O
sushi B-AS
is O
reasonably O
priced B-AS
and O
fresh O
. O

It O
's O
no O
- O
fuss O
, O
fast O
and O
delicious O
. O

Save O
room O
for O
deserts B-AS
, O
they O
're O
to O
die O
for O
. O

Best O
things O
to O
order O
are O
from O
the O
grill B-AS
Churrasco I-AS
and O
Ribs B-AS
. O

The O
traditional B-AS
Italian I-AS
items I-AS
are O
great O
, O
cheap O
and O
served B-AS
in O
a O
cozy O
setting B-AS
. O

Whether O
your O
choose O
the O
iced B-AS
blended I-AS
mocha I-AS
or O
the O
hot B-AS
white I-AS
mocha I-AS
you O
are O
sure O
to O
be O
extremely O
happy O
. O

last O
Tuesday O
for O
a O
late B-AS
lunch I-AS
with O
a O
friend O
. O

It O
was O
delish O
and O
I O
did O
n't O
feel O
bad O
eating O
it O
. O

Another O
friend O
had O
to O
ask O
3 O
times O
for O
parmesan B-AS
cheese I-AS
. O

Our O
waitress B-AS
had O
apparently O
never O
tried O
any O
of O
the O
food B-AS
, O
and O
there O
was O
no O
one O
to O
recommend O
any O
wine B-AS
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
a O
bit O
slow O
and O
the O
portions B-AS
are O
a O
bit O
small O
so O
if O
you O
are O
hungry O
and O
in O
a O
rush O
, O
this O
is O
not O
the O
place O
for O
you O
. O

No O
doubt O
the O
next O
time O
we O
want O
to O
go O
out O
for O
a O
special O
occasion O
or O
are O
entertaining O
guests O
from O
out O
of O
town O
, O
Spirit O
and O
Bateaux O
will O
be O
our O
destination O
. O

i O
would O
recommend O
Jewel O
Bako O
if O
you O
want O
to O
feel O
like O
you O
were O
kicked O
in O
the O
groin O
and O
had O
to O
pay O
for O
it O
too O
. O

The O
ambiance O
was O
pretty O
cool O
, O
but O
not O
worth O
the O
hassle O
. O

The O
unfortunate O
lady O
next O
to O
us O
thought O
she O
had O
ordered O
a O
salad B-AS
including O
asking O
for O
salad B-AS
dressing O
and O
was O
instead O
given O
a O
quesedilla B-AS
. O

El O
Nidos O
one O
of O
the O
best O
restaurants O
in O
New O
York O
which O
I O
' O
ve O
ever O
been O
to O
, O
has O
a O
great O
variety O
of O
tasty O
, O
mouth O
watering O
pizza B-AS
's I-AS
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
pretty O
poor O
all O
around O
, O
the O
food B-AS
was O
well O
below O
average O
relative O
to O
the O
cost B-AS
, O
and O
outside O
there O
is O
a O
crazy O
bum O
who O
harasses O
every O
customer O
who O
leaves O
the O
place O
. O

Although O
I O
moved O
uptown O
I O
try O
to O
stop O
in O
as O
often O
as O
possible O
for O
the O
GREAT O
cheap O
food B-AS
and O
to O
pay O
the O
friendly O
staff B-AS
a O
visit O
. O

I O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
my O
friend O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
for O
a O
few O
minutes O

Chef B-AS
Vincenzo O
, O
always O
there O
if O
you O
need O
him O
, O
is O
a O
real O
talent O
and O
a O
real O
Roman O
. O

If O
you O
're O
looking O
to O
taste O
some O
great O
Indian B-AS
food I-AS
and O
want O
good O
service B-AS
, O
definitely O
visit O
Curry O
Leaf O
. O

You O
must O
try O
Odessa B-AS
stew I-AS
or O
Rabbit B-AS
stew I-AS
; O
salads B-AS
good O
; O
and O
kompot B-AS
is O
soo O
refreshing O
during O
the O
hot O
summer O
day O
they O
make O
it O
the O
way O
my O
mom O
does O
, O
reminds O
me O
of O
home O
a O
lot O
. O

My O
daughter O
and O
I O
left O
feeling O
satisfied O
not O
stuffed O
and O
it O
felt O
good O
to O
know O
we O
had O
a O
healthy O
lunch B-AS
. O

I O
' O
m O
almost O
tempted O
to O
give O
this O
place O
a O
bad O
review O
so O
I O
can O
keep O
the O
crowds O
awaybeen O
going O
there O
on O
and O
off O
for O
a O
year O
now O
and O
it O
's O
really O
my O
fave O
hang O
out O
in O
the O
city O
. O

When O
she O
complained O
, O
the O
waitress B-AS
said O
, O
Sorry O
. O

The O
quality B-AS
of I-AS
the I-AS
meat I-AS
was O
on O
par O
with O
your O
local O
grocery O
store O
. O

They O
specialize O
in O
smoothies B-AS
and O
fresh B-AS
juices I-AS
. O

It O
first O
came O
well O
done O
, O
and O
I O
politely O
sent O
it O
back O
. O

I O
recommend O
the O
black B-AS
roasted I-AS
codfish I-AS
, O
it O
was O
the O
best O
dish B-AS
of O
the O
evening O
. O

The O
manager B-AS
then O
told O
us O
we O
could O
order O
from O
whatever O
menu B-AS
we O
wanted O
but O
by O
that O
time O
we O
were O
so O
annoyed O
with O
the O
waiter B-AS
and O
the O
resturant O
that O
we O
let O
and O
went O
some O
place O
else O
. O

In O
mi O
burrito O
, O
here O
was O
nothing O
but O
dark O
chicken B-AS
that O
had O
that O
cooked O
last O
week O
and O
just O
warmed O
up O
in O
a O
microwave O
taste B-AS
. O

during O
busy O
hrs O
, O
i O
recommend O
that O
you O
make O
a O
reservation B-AS
. O

Do O
n't O
waste O
your O
time O
or O
your O
money O
. O

it O
's O
good O
but O
, O
like O
the O
movie O
is O
never O
as O
good O
as O
the O
book O
, O
this O
is O
same O
analogy O
. O

it O
was O
a O
very O
warm O
experience O
. O

I O
went O
to O
Common O
Stock O
for O
brunch B-AS
and O
I O
was O
so O
impressed O
. O

now O
called O
nikki O
sushi B-AS
, O
sushi B-AS
is O
OK O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
also O
outstanding O
and O
is O
served B-AS
quite O
quickly O
. O

I O
just O
have O
nothing O
to O
say O
about O
this O
place O
that O
is O
negative O
except O
that O
it O
's O
not O
a O
cheap O
night O
outbut O
it O
's O
SO O
worth O
it O
. O

From O
the O
erbazzone B-AS
emiliana I-AS
to O
the O
mostarda B-AS
on I-AS
the I-AS
cheese I-AS
plate I-AS
, O
the O
dishes B-AS
at O
this O
restaurant O
are O
all O
handled O
with O
delicate O
care O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
delicious O
and O
the O
bar B-AS
has O
a O
great O
vibe B-AS
. O

expectations O
were O
real O
hi O
reading O
the O
10 O
's O
' O
. O

There O
's O
candlelight B-AS
and O
music B-AS
. O

It O
's O
nice O
to O
find O
a O
place O
that O
is O
open O
24 O
hours O
especially O
in O
downtown O
Brooklyn O
. O

Simple O
healthy O
unglamorous O
food B-AS
cheap O
. O

It O
was O
such O
a O
fantastic O
dining B-AS
experience I-AS
, O
that O
I O
returned O
again O
the O
same O
week O
. O

To O
be O
fair O
, O
the O
food B-AS
still O
is O
good O
and O
the O
service B-AS
is O
quick O
and O
attentative O
even O
though O
its O
usually O
very O
busy O
. O

The O
place B-AS
is O
absolutely O
adorable O
and O
the O
food B-AS
is O
delicious O
. O

I O
ordered O
the O
Chicken B-AS
Teriyaki I-AS
and O
my O
husband O
got O
Garlic B-AS
Shrimp I-AS
. O

I O
' O
ve O
had O
better O
Japanese B-AS
food I-AS
at O
a O
mall O
food O
court O
. O

The O
staff B-AS
members I-AS
are O
extremely O
friendly O
and O
even O
replaced O
my O
drink B-AS
once O
when O
I O
dropped O
it O
outside O
. O

Cool O
atmosphere B-AS
but O
such O
a O
let O
down O
. O

The O
Sashimi B-AS
portion I-AS
are O
big O
enough O
to O
appease O
most O
people O
, O
but O
I O
did O
n't O
like O
the O
fact O
they O
used O
artifical B-AS
lobster I-AS
meat I-AS
. O

They O
have O
wheat B-AS
crusted I-AS
pizza I-AS
made O
with O
really O
fresh O
and O
yummy O
ingredients B-AS
. O

Had O
a O
lovely O
dinner B-AS
in O
this O
dedicated O
seaASPECT1 O
joint O
, O
food B-AS
was O
well O
- O
prepared O
and O
-presented O
and O
the O
service B-AS
was O
pleasant O
and O
prompt O
. O

the O
icing O
MADE O
this O
cake B-AS
, O
it O
was O
fluffy O
, O
not O
ultra O
sweet O
, O
creamy O
and O
light O
. O

Finally O
let O
into O
the O
store O
5 O
at O
a O
time O
, O
to O
buy O
expensive O
slices B-AS
from O
a O
harried O
staff B-AS
. O

We O
ended O
up O
having O
to O
just O
leave O
because O
we O
were O
essentially O
being O
ignored O
by O
the O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
-- O
even O
though O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
restaurant O
was O
largely O
empty O
. O

The O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
is O
extensive O
, O
well O
priced B-AS
and O
covers O
alot O
of O
regions O
. O

Go O
here O
if O
you O
want O
fresh O
and O
tasty O
salads B-AS
of O
any O
type O
you O
can O
imagine O
. O

Everything O
about O
this O
place O
is O
adorable O
, O
even O
the O
bathroom B-AS
! O

Speedy O
delivers B-AS
, O
great O
food B-AS
, O
decent O
prices B-AS
, O
and O
friendly O
service B-AS
combine O
to O
ensure O
an O
enjoyable O
repast B-AS
. O

THEY O
HAVE O
WAITERS B-AS
ON O
THE O
SIDEWALK O
TRYING O
TO O
PULL O
YOU O
IN O
WHICH O
MADE O
US O
SUSPICIOUS O
. O

IT O
WAS O
OUR O
ONLY O
OPPORTUNITY O
TO O
VISIT O
AND O
WANTED O
AN O
AUTHENTIC O
ITALIAN B-AS
MEAL I-AS
. O

It O
took O
100 O
years O
for O
Parisi O
to O
get O
around O
to O
making O
pizza B-AS
at O
least O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
they O
ever O
made O
it O
before O
this O
yearbut O
it O
was O
worth O
the O
wait O
. O

I O
asked O
for O
a O
simple O
medium O
rare O
steak B-AS
. O

Generously O
garnished O
, O
organic B-AS
grilled I-AS
burgers I-AS
are O
the O
most O
popular O
dish B-AS
, O
but O
the O
Jerusalem B-AS
market I-AS
- I-AS
style I-AS
falafel I-AS
wraps I-AS
and O
Mediterranean B-AS
salads I-AS
-- I-AS
layered I-AS
with I-AS
beets I-AS
, I-AS
goat I-AS
cheese I-AS
and I-AS
walnuts I-AS
-- O
are O
equally O
scrumptious O
. O

Probably O
my O
worst O
dining B-AS
experience I-AS
in O
new O
york O
, O
and O
I O
' O
m O
a O
former O
waiter B-AS
so O
I O
know O
what O
I O
' O
m O
talking O
about O
. O

Result O
red O
velvet O
, O
Great O
texture B-AS
, O
soft O
and O
velvety O
, O
nice O
hint B-AS
of I-AS
cocoa I-AS
. O

Ask O
for O
the O
round B-AS
corner I-AS
table I-AS
next I-AS
to I-AS
the I-AS
large I-AS
window I-AS
. O

Their O
twist B-AS
on I-AS
pizza I-AS
is O
heatlhy O
, O
but O
full O
of O
flavor B-AS
. O

The O
lack O
of O
AC B-AS
and O
the O
fact O
that O
there O
are O
a O
million O
swarming O
bodies O
although O
everyone O
is O
polite O
and O
no O
one O
is O
pushing O
is O
a O
slight O
turn O
off O
. O

I O
love O
the O
Little O
Pie O
Company O
as O
much O
as O
anyone O
else O
who O
has O
written O
reviews O
, O
but O
must O
discourage O
anyone O
from O
visiting O
the O
Grand O
Central O
location O
due O
to O
their O
RUDE O
service B-AS
from O
two O
sales B-AS
people I-AS
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
unless O
you O
live O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
, O
it O
's O
not O
in O
a O
convenient O
location B-AS
but O
is O
more O
like O
a O
hidden O
treasure O
. O

Did O
n't O
seem O
like O
any O
effort O
was O
made O
to O
the O
display B-AS
and I-AS
quality I-AS
of I-AS
the I-AS
food I-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
-- O
though O
mostly O
deep O
- O
fried O
-- O
is O
simple O
and O
satisfying O
. O

We O
live O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
and O
have O
been O
going O
there O
twice O
a O
week O
since O
the O
day O
they O
first O
opened O
. O

Glechik O
might O
be O
way O
too O
tiny O
for O
a O
restaurant O
by O
Russian O
standards O
, O
but O
it O
is O
cozy O
and O
the O
food B-AS
is O
simply O
GREAT O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
excellent O
, O
authentic O
Italian B-AS
cuisine I-AS
made O
absolutely O
fresh O
. O

At O
night O
the O
atmoshere B-AS
changes O
turning O
into O
this O
hidden O
jewel O
that O
is O
waiting O
to O
be O
discovered O

The O
other O
times O
I O
' O
ve O
gone O
it O

heaven O
, O
you O
can O
walk O
in O
get O
a O
booth B-AS
by I-AS
the I-AS
windows I-AS
, O
be O
treated O
like O
a O
VIP O
in O
a O
not O
- O
crowded O
place B-AS
, O
with O
great O
food B-AS
and O
service B-AS
. O

I O
would O
only O
go O
for O
the O
coffee B-AS
which O
is O
way O
better O
than O
Starbucks O
or O
the O
like O
. O

I O
used O
to O
be O
a O
regular O
costumer O
at O
pongal O
until O
dosa O
hut O
opened O
right O
next O
door O
to O
it O
. O

Somewhat O
disappointing O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
only O
new O
vintages B-AS
. O

Both O
were O
very O
good O
, O
but O
nothing O
you O
could O
n't O
get O
at O
similar O
restaurant O
. O

If O
your O

like O
some O
Chinese O
restaurants O
in O
midtown O

Service B-AS
was O

it O
is O
a O
great O
place B-AS
to O
watch O
sporting O
events O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
great O
, O
and O
they O
have O
a O
whole O
great O
deal O
for O
birthdays O
. O

The O
staff B-AS
is O
100 O
% O
Italian O
and O
the O
food B-AS
is O
as O
authentic O
as O
it O
gets O
. O

My O
only O
complaint O
might O
be O
the O
fortune B-AS
cookies I-AS
, O
I O
' O
ve O
never O
had O
a O
cookie B-AS
predict O
bad O
luck O
for O
me O
before O
I O
visited O
Kar O
. O

Good O
for O
a O
quick O
sushi B-AS
lunch I-AS
. O

Have O
a O
mojito B-AS
and O
sit O
in O
the O
back B-AS
patio I-AS
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
dreadfully O
slow O
the O
place O
was O
only O
half O
full O
and O
a O
smile O
would O
have O
been O
nice O
. O

I O
went O
this O
past O
Saturday O
and O
had O
a O
excellent O
meal B-AS
of O
consisting O
of O
a O
braised B-AS
lamb I-AS
shank I-AS
with I-AS
mashed I-AS
potatoes I-AS
. O

The O
waitress B-AS
came O
by O
to O
pick O
up O
the O
soy B-AS
sauce I-AS
WHILE O
we O
were O
eating O
our O
lunch B-AS
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O

So O
we O
sat O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
, O
the O
bar B-AS
did O
n't O
seem O
like O
he O
wanted O
to O
be O
there O
. O

I O
reccomend O
the O
fried B-AS
pork I-AS
dumplings I-AS
, O
the O
orange B-AS
chicken I-AS
/ I-AS
beef I-AS
, O
and O
the O

. O

You O
will O
not O
be O
dissapointed O
by O
any O
of O
the O
choices O
in O
the O
menu B-AS
. O

The O
french B-AS
fries I-AS
-- I-AS
with I-AS
the I-AS
kalmata I-AS
dip I-AS
were O
terrific O
! O

Would O
you O
ever O
believe O
that O
when O
you O
complain O
about O
over O
an O
hour O
wait B-AS
, O
when O
they O
tell O
you O
it O
will O
be O
20 O
- O
30 O
minutes O
, O
the O
manager B-AS
tells O
the O
bartender B-AS
to O
spill O
the O
drinks B-AS
you O
just O
paid O
for O
? O

The O
boutique B-AS
selection I-AS
of I-AS
wines I-AS
covers O
a O
wide O
variety O
without O
being O
imposeing O
. O

If O
you O
're O
lucky O
and O
there O
's O
not O
a O
private O
party O
going O
on O
back O
there O
, O
you O
'll O
get O
a O
chance O
to O
really O
chill O
out O
. O

They O
also O
have O
a O
great O
assortment B-AS
of I-AS
wraps I-AS
if O
your O
not O
in O
the O
mood O
for O
traditional B-AS
Mediterranean I-AS
fare I-AS
. O

Fresh B-AS

and O
all O

it O
delicious O
. O

Disappointingly O
, O
their O
wonderful O
Saketini B-AS
has O
been O
taken O
off O
the O
bar B-AS
menu I-AS
. O

In O
Short O
The O
Black O
Sheep O
distinguishes O
itself O
from O
the O
Midtown O
pub O
herd O
with O
a O
look B-AS
that O
's O
a O
mix O
of O
sports O
- O
bar O
butch O
and O
ornate O
kitsch O
. O

I O
would O
definitely O
go O
back O
- O
if O
only O
for O
some O
of O
those O
exotic O
martinis B-AS
on O
the O
blackboard O
. O

They O
are O
located O
off O
the O
beaten O
path O
but O
are O
certainly O
worth O
the O
trip O
. O

then O
she O
made O
a O
fuss O
about O
not O
being O
able O
to O
add O
1 O
or O
2 O
chairs B-AS
on O
either O
end O
of O
the O
table B-AS
for O
additional O
people O
. O

The O
happy B-AS
hour I-AS
is O
so O
cheap O
, O
but O
that O
does O
not O
reflect O
the O
service B-AS
or O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
. O

After O
waiting B-AS
for O
almost O
an O
hour O
, O
the O
waiter B-AS
brusquely O
told O
us O
he O
'd O
forgotten O
to O
give O
the O
kitchen B-AS
our O
order O
. O

With O
all O
the O
mundane O
or O
mediocre O
places O
on O
8th O
avenue O
it O
is O
nice O
to O
have O
one O
that O
is O
a O
step O
above O
in O
quaility B-AS
and O
atmosphere B-AS
. O

A O
mix O
of O
students O
and O
area O
residents O
crowd O
into O
this O
narrow O
, O
barely O
there O
space B-AS
for O
its O
quick O
, O
tasty O
treats B-AS
at O
dirt O
- O
cheap O
prices B-AS
. O

Give O
it O
a O
try O
, O
menu B-AS
is O
typical O
French O
but O
varied O
. O

It O
gets O
crowded O
at O
lunchtime O
but O
there O
are O
lots O
of O
seats B-AS
in O
back O
and O
everyone O
who O
works O
there O
is O
so O
nice O
. O

but O
for O
the O
value B-AS
, O
it O
was O
a O
great O
affordable O
spot O
to O
enjoy O
a O
fun O
night O
out O
with O
small O
group O
. O

the O
negative O
reviews O
on O
city O
search O
are O
probably O
from O
jealous O
competing O
restaurants O
who O
realize O
they O
ca O
n't O
compete O
with O
Temple O
's O
entire O
positive O
attitude B-AS
about O
the O
proper O
way O
to O
treat O
their O
customers O
and O
deliver O
top O
quality O
food B-AS
. O

We O
ordered O
a O
glass B-AS
of I-AS
wine I-AS
and O
were O
finished O
eating O
and O
paying O
before O
the O
wine O
came O
. O

It O
was O
good O
, O
but O
none O
of O
the O
flavors B-AS
WOW O
. O

Overall O
, O
this O
is O
a O
nice O
place B-AS
to O
take O
a O
few O
friends O
to O
hang O
out O
at O
and O
the O
service B-AS
is O
excellent O
. O

Food B-AS
is O
excellent O
quality O
for O
a O
good O
restaurant O
price B-AS
. O

Actually O
, O
everyone O
who O
worked O
there O
seemed O
to O
be O
annoyed O
. O

for O
about O
eleven O
bucks O
you O
get O
a O
gigantic O
burrito B-AS
or O
tacos B-AS
, O
margarita B-AS
, O
and O
dessert B-AS
. O

The O
space B-AS
is O
traditional O
in O
feel O
. O

the O
restaurant O
was O
completely O
empty O
, O
but O
she O
gave O
me O
a O
dirty O
look O
and O
asked O
, O
no O
reservations B-AS
? O

the O
food B-AS
was O
mediocre O
to O
be O
kind O
, O
the O
interior B-AS
is O
small O
and O
average O
, O
the O
owners B-AS
are O
a O
tag O
- O
team O
of O
unpleasantries O
, O
so O
rude O
and O
snotty O
i O
actually O
let O
out O
a O
hearty O
guffaw O
whilst O
dining B-AS

Good O

I O
have O
been O
going O
to O
this O
restaurant O
for O
years O
, O
in O
the O
past O
the O
service B-AS
was O
average O
and O
the O
food B-AS
inconsistant O
. O

The O
music B-AS
was O
fascinating O
, O
but O
left O
room O
for O
conversation O
, O
and O
the O
bartender B-AS
made O
superb O
drinks B-AS
. O

rice B-AS

rarely O

that O
was O
just O
so O

Most O
of O

made O
with O

which O
is O
actually O
pretty O
good O
. O

i O
went O
in O
one O
day O
asking O
for O
a O
table B-AS
for O
a O
group O
and O
was O
greeted O
by O
a O
very O
rude O
hostess B-AS
. O

It O
's O
worthwhile O
to O
take O
a O
cab O
to O
Chelsea O
just O
for O
an O
awesome O
dinner B-AS
at O
My O
Chelsea O
. O

Not O
only O
is O
the O
food B-AS
authentic O
, O
but O
the O
staff B-AS
here O
are O
practically O
off O
- O
the O
- O
boat O
, O
they O
are O
young O
and O
hip O
and O
know O
what O
they O
are O
doing O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
food B-AS
and O

. O

It O
has O
good O

tapas B-AS
, O
an O
interesting O
selection B-AS
of I-AS
wines I-AS
( I-AS
primarily I-AS
Spanish I-AS
) I-AS
and O
a O
lowkey O
hip O
neighborhood O
clientele B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
great O
, O
I O
love O
their O
dumplings B-AS

. O

And O

food B-AS
will O
keep O
you O
coming O
back O

Waiting B-AS
three O
hours O
before O
getting O
our O
entrees B-AS
was O
a O
treat O
as O
well O
. O

It O
's O
the O
conversations O
that O
make O
this O
a O
fun O
place B-AS
to O
be O
. O

My O
gf O

duck B-AS
confitte I-AS
was O
very O
solid O
as O
well O
, O
although O
i O

The O

list I-AS
was O
superb O
, O
our O

delightful O
, O
and O
the O
quiet O
atmosphere B-AS
perfect O
for O

You O
can O
eat O
gourmet O

I O
' O
ve O
eaten O
at O

three O
locations O
and O
I O
always O
love O
, O
love O
the O
food B-AS
, O
the O
service B-AS
is O
always O
wonderful O
and O
the O
prices B-AS
are O
really O
reasonable O
. O

Not O
because O
I O
was O
pregnant O
, O
but O
the O
food B-AS
here O
is O
always O
delicious O
. O

Had O
a O
great O
meal B-AS
there O
this O
weekend O
before O
heading O
to O
the O
movies O
! O

We O
had O
a O
birthday O
party O
here O
recently O
and O
the O
food B-AS
and O
service B-AS
was O
amazing O
. O

the O
dinner B-AS
menu I-AS
offers O
a O
variety O
of O
great O
entrees B-AS
, O
including O
fresh O
seafood B-AS
and O
huge O
steaks B-AS
, O
there O
's O
also O
a O
couple O
of O
non B-AS
- I-AS
meat I-AS
alternatives I-AS
. O

This O
place O
has O
the O
strangest O
menu B-AS
and O
the O
restaurants O
tries O
too O
hard O
to O
make O
fancy O
food B-AS
. O

The O
appetizers B-AS
are O
ok O
, O
but O
the O
service B-AS
is O
slow O
. O

the O
food B-AS
, O
not O
worth O
the O
price B-AS
. O

What O
can O
you O
say O
about O
a O
place O
where O
the O
waitress B-AS
brings O
out O
the O
wrong O
entree B-AS
, O
then O
verbally O
assaults O
your O
80 O
year O
old O
grandmother O
and O
gives O
her O
lip O
about O
sending O
it O
back O
which O
she O
did O
politely O
, O
by O
the O
way O
. O

The O
prices B-AS
are O
not O
terrible O
. O

15 O
% O
gratuity B-AS
automatically O
added O
to O
the O
bill B-AS
. O

The O
halibut B-AS
cheek I-AS
appetizer I-AS
came O
with O
a O
generous O
portion B-AS
of I-AS
foie I-AS
gras I-AS
, O
but O
that O
's O
about O
the O
only O
positive O
thing O
I O
can O
say O
about O
the O
meal O
. O

Food B-AS
is O
excellent O
and O
they O
also O
have O
empenadas B-AS
and O
plaintains B-AS
which O
are O
good O
for O
an O
afternoon B-AS
snack I-AS
. O

Both O
a O
number O
of O
the O
appetizer B-AS
and O
pasta B-AS
specials I-AS
were O
amazing O
. O

All O

Although O
somewhat O
loud O
, O
the O
noise O
was O
minimally O
intrusive O
. O

It O
's O
a O
basic O
pizza B-AS
joint O
, O
not O
much O
to O
look O
at O
, O
but O
the O
pizza B-AS
is O
what O
I O
go O
for O
. O

Tables B-AS
are O
close O
, O
so O
you O
better O
be O
comfortable O
bumping O
elbows O
with O
other O
patrons O
. O

Not O

much O
so O
, O
but O
enough O
that O
there O

a O
great O
scene B-AS

You O

the O
calamari B-AS

The O

The O

even O

The O

but O
it O
was O
a O
little O
too O
dark O
. O

The O

. O

The O

a O
quite O

. O

The O

I O

@ O
PIGALLE O

Best O
hot B-AS

in O
the O

. O

This O
is O
a O
typical O
example O
of O
an O
establishment O
in O
which O
its O
owners O
do O
not O
know O
anything O
about O
the O
restaurant O
business O
! O

I O
would O
not O
recommend O
MEET O
at O
all O
, O
it O
is O
a O
rip O
off O
all O
the O
way O
from O
the O
time O
to O
step O
in O
! O

Went O
there O
for O
a O
special O
celebration O
. O

The O
restaurant O
was O
quiet O
and O
intimate O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
very O
attentive O
and O
very O
generous O
. O

We O
had O
tons O
of O
great O
food B-AS
, O
wine B-AS
, O
and O
desserts B-AS
. O

Really O
Lovely O
dining B-AS
experience I-AS
in O
the O
midst O
of O

midtown O
area O
. O

OK O
, O
I O
' O
ve O
been O
to O
Dumont O
a O
few O
times O
now O
. O

The O
food B-AS
really O
is O
n't O
very O
good O
and O
the O
service B-AS
is O
terrible O
. O

Maybe O
it O
's O
that O
most O
of O
Dumont O
's O
patrons O
are O
younger O
and O
have O
lower O
expectations O
, O
but O
I O
can O
not O
recommend O
Dumont O
. O

Not O
only O
do O
they O
have O
the O
best O
escargot B-AS
in O
town O
, O
they O
always O
try O
to O
accomodate O
our O
toddler O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
been O
to O
Sotto O
Voce O
several O
time O
, O
and O
I O
have O
to O
say O
this O
one O
place O
that O
hits O
the O
nail O
right O
on O
the O
head O
ever O
time O
! O

Between O
my O
guest O
and O
I O
, O
we O
sampled O
at O
least O
80 O
% O
of O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
and O
they O
were O
all O
hits O
. O

The O
Deco B-AS
and O
ambiance B-AS
was O
really O
romantic O
. O

This O
is O
the O
best O
unknown O
restaurant O
in O
and O
around O
New O
York O
. O

Just O
go O
in O
and O
sample O
the O

For O
someone O
who O
used O
to O
hate O
Indian B-AS
food I-AS
, O
Baluchi O

has O
changed O
my O

Finally O
a O

I O
can O
eat O

not O
suffer O

menu I-AS

Not O
only O
was O
the O
waiter B-AS
efficient O
and O
courteous O
, O
but O
also O
extremely O
helpful O
. O

It O
took O
a O
bigger O
bite O
from O
my O
wallet O
than O
my O
appetite O
, O
I O
would O
not O
reccomend O
this O
to O
anyone O
that O
I O
would O
want O
to O
talk O
to O
me O
again O
! O
! O

This O

, O
the O

is O
warm O
and O
hospitable O
, O
and O
the O

I O

about O
this O
place O
in O
Time O
Out O
magazine O
. O

It O
's O
a O
great O
find O
in O
Astoria O
. O

Great O
burgers B-AS
, O
grilled B-AS

. O

The O
Yellowfin B-AS
Tuna I-AS
and O
Calf B-AS

liver I-AS
are O
my O
favorites O
! O

Sushi B-AS
so O
fresh O
that O
it O
crunches O
in O
your O
mouth O
. O

But O
make O
sure O
you O
have O
enough O
room O
on O
your O
credit O
card O
as O
the O
bill B-AS
will O
leave O
a O
big O
dent O
in O
your O
wallet O
. O

Despite O
the O
5th O
ave O
address O
there O
are O
no O
frills O
whick O
I O
also O
love O
. O

They O
bring O
a O
sauce B-AS
cart I-AS
up O
to O
your O
table B-AS
and O
offer O
you O
up O
to O
7 O
or O
8 O
choices B-AS
of I-AS
sauces I-AS
for O
your O
steak B-AS
I O
tried O
them O
ALL O
. O

Not O
only O
was O
the O
sushi B-AS
fresh O
, O
they O
also O
served O
other O
entrees B-AS
allowed O
each O
guest O
something O
to O
choose O
from O
and O
we O
all O
left O
happy O
try O
the O
duck B-AS
! O

good O
variety B-AS
but O
nothing O
surprising O
. O

After O
I O
paid O
for O
my O
purchase O
, O
I O
noticed O
they O
had O
not O
given O
me O
utensils B-AS
so O
I O
could O
eat O
my O
pie B-AS
. O

Likewise O
if O
you O
like O
really O
thin B-AS
crust I-AS
or O
really O
big O
slices B-AS
then O
Nick O
and O
Joe O
's O
may O
not O
be O
your O
favorite O
. O

It O
's O
always O
quiet O
because O
it O
's O
awful O
. O

No O
green B-AS
beans I-AS
, O
no O
egg B-AS
, O
no O
anchovy B-AS
dressing I-AS
, O
no O
nicoise B-AS
olives I-AS
, O
no O
red B-AS
onion I-AS
. O

Build O
a O
meal B-AS
with O
side B-AS
orders I-AS
like O
Amazin B-AS
' I-AS
Greens I-AS
salads I-AS
, O
Buffalo B-AS
Chicken I-AS
Kickers I-AS
and O
Cinna B-AS
Stix I-AS
. O

Thick O
fries B-AS
, O
meaty B-AS
chili I-AS
and O
stuffed B-AS
baked I-AS
potatoes I-AS
round O
out O
a O
menu B-AS
that O
includes O
a O
cool O
, O
ultra O
- O
thick O
chocolate B-AS
Frosty I-AS
. O

I O
always O
find O
myself O
asking O
the O
waiter B-AS
to O
make O
something O
bland O
and O
different O
than O
what O
is O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
. O

Good O
cake B-AS
BUT O
, O
it O
was O
not O
the O
best O
cake B-AS
i O
' O
ve O
ever O
had O
, O
and O
definately O
not O
worth O
standing O
outside O
on O
the O
sidewalk O
being O
herded O
like O
cattle O
by O
indifferent O
and O
overworked O
employees B-AS
. O

The O
closest O
that O
I O
got O
was O
the O
Cherry B-AS
Marscapone I-AS
, O
but O
they O
were O
out O
of O
it O
that O
day O
. O

The O
homage O
to O
India O
is O
most O
evident O
in O
the O
delectable O
roti B-AS
canai I-AS
appetizer I-AS
, O
a O
fried B-AS
pancake I-AS
served I-AS
with I-AS
pungent I-AS
curry I-AS
dipping I-AS
sauce I-AS
, O
while O
the O
mango B-AS
chicken I-AS
offers O
a O
surprisingly O
sophisticated O
, O
fresh O
take O
on O
sweet O
- O
and O
- O
sour O
. O

It O
does O
n't O
look O
like O
much O
on O
the O
outside B-AS
, O
but O
the O
minute O
you O
walk O
inside O
, O
it O
's O
a O
whole O
other O
atmosphere B-AS
. O

I O
have O
to O
say O
the O
place O
was O
awesome O
. O

The O
ground B-AS
chickpea I-AS
soup I-AS
we O
sampled O
as O
a O
starter B-AS
tasted O
somewhat O
thin O
. O

We O
requested O
they O
re O
- O
slice O
the O
sushi B-AS
, O
and O
it O
was O
returned O
to O
us O
in O
small O
cheese O
- O
like O
cubes O
. O

The O
service B-AS
, O
however O
, O
is O
a O
peg O
or O
two O
below O
the O
quality B-AS
of I-AS
food I-AS
horrible O
bartenders B-AS
, O
and O
the O
clientele B-AS
, O
for O
the O
most O
part O
, O
are O
rowdy O
, O
loud O
- O
mouthed O
commuters O
this O
could O
explain O
the O
bad O
attitudes O
from O
the O
staff B-AS
getting O
loaded O
for O
an O
AC O
/ O
DC O
concert O
or O
a O
Knicks O
game O
. O

If O
you O
're O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
, O
definitely O
stop O
by O
for O
a O
great O
meal B-AS
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
with O
our O
show O
tickets O
, O
we O
did O
n't O
have O
time O
to O
sample O
any O
desserts B-AS
. O

The O
restaurant O
could O
use O
a O
little O
paint O
, O
but O
all O
in O
all O
a O
great O
sushi O
place O
! O

Make O
more O
tables B-AS
perhaps O
a O
rooftop B-AS
bar I-AS
? O

The O
decoration B-AS
was O
feeling O
like O
we O
was O
on O
the O
Cairo O
, O
actually O
the O
street O
is O
part O
of O
that O
adventure O
. O

Although O
small O
, O
it O
has O
beautiful O
ambience B-AS
, O
excellent O
food B-AS
the O
catfish B-AS
is O
delicious O
, O
if O
ya O
do O
n't O
mind O
it O
a O
lil O
salty O
and O
attentive O
service B-AS
. O

I O
did O
n't O
go O
there O
for O
food B-AS
so O
I O
ca O
n't O
comment O

My O
friends O

we O
live O
in O

, O
wings B-AS
, O
cajun B-AS

Bring O
your O

and O
a O
bottle B-AS
of I-AS

Not O
only O
is O
this O
the O
best O
Thai O
restaurant O
I O
have O
been O
to O
, O
but O
it O
also O
ranks O
as O
one O
of O
my O

a O
great O
experience O
, O
from O
the O
wine B-AS
to O
the O
dessert B-AS
menu I-AS
. O

Highly O
recommended O
As O
stated O
, O
I O
have O
n't O
dined O
* O
in O
* O
the O
restaurant O
but O
stopped O
by O
there O
to O
pick O
up O
takeout B-AS
and O
it O
seems O
a O
very O
relaxing O
place B-AS
; O
also O
, O
the O
bar B-AS
looks O
nice O
. O

The O
ambiance B-AS
was O
fine O
, O
a O
little O
loud O
but O
still O
nice O
and O
romantic O
. O

but O
, O
the O
filet B-AS
mignon I-AS
was O
not O
very O
good O
at O
all O
cocktail B-AS
hour I-AS
includes O
free O
appetizers B-AS
nice O
non B-AS
- I-AS
sushi I-AS
selection I-AS
. O

It O
took O
about O
2 O
1/2 O
hours O
to O
be O
served B-AS
our O
2 O
courses B-AS
. O

Who O
said O
go O
when O
the O
place B-AS
is O
quiet O
during O
the O
day O
? O

Can O
be O
a O
bit O
busy O
around O
peak O
times O
because O
of O
the O
size B-AS
. O

I O
was O
on O
jury O
duty O
, O
rode O
my O
bike O
up O
Centre O
Street O
on O
my O
lunch O
break O
and O
came O
across O
this O
great O
little O
place B-AS
with O
awesome O
chicken B-AS
tacos I-AS
and O
Hibiscus B-AS
lemonade I-AS
. O

good O
place B-AS
to O
hang O
out O
during O
the O
day O
after O
shopping O
or O
to O
grab O
a O
simple O
soup B-AS
or O
classic O
french B-AS
dish I-AS
over O
a O
glass B-AS
of I-AS
wine I-AS
. O

Very O
nice O
touch O
that O
very O
much O
fits O
the O
place B-AS
. O

However O
, O
there O
is O
just O
something O
so O
great O
about O
being O
outdoors B-AS
, O
in O
great O
landscaping O
, O
enjoying O
a O
casual B-AS
drink I-AS
that O
makes O
going O
to O
this O
place B-AS
worthwhile O
. O

We O
were O
seated O
promptly O
in O
close O
proximity O
to O
the O
dance B-AS
floor I-AS
. O

If O
you O
are O
here O
as O
a O
pre B-AS
- I-AS
show I-AS
meal I-AS
, O
hop O
in O
a O
cab O
and O
take O
the O
extra O
10 O
minutes O
to O
go O
to O
the O
uptown O
location O
. O

A O
plus O
was O
the O
good O
mix O
of O
people O
in O
their O
twenties O
that O
provided O
for O
great O
eye O
- O
candy O
while O
I O
was O
there O
. O

The O
comments O
about O
fried B-AS
foods I-AS
is O
correct O
below O
but O
the O
other O
dishes B-AS
, O
including O
the O
lamb B-AS
entree I-AS
and O
many O
of O
the O
salads B-AS
( I-AS
avocado I-AS
shrimp I-AS
) I-AS
were O
quite O
good O
. O

It O
's O
best O
to O
go O
on O
a O
cold O
night O
with O
a O
close O
friend O
or O
a O
good O
book O
. O

Slow O
service B-AS
, O
but O
when O
you O
're O
hanging O
around O
with O
groups O
of O
10 O
or O
20 O
, O
who O
really O
notices O
? O

The O
sauce B-AS
is O
excellent O
very O
fresh O
with O
dabs B-AS
of I-AS
real I-AS
mozzarella I-AS
. O

Do O
n't O
ever O
bother O
, O
the O
drinks B-AS
were O
awful O
, O
but O
it O
was O
the O
people B-AS
who O
work O
there O
that O
really O
made O
this O
the O
worst O
experience O
at O
dining B-AS
. O

The O
room B-AS
is O
a O
little O
plain O
, O
but O
it O
's O
difficult O
to O
make O
such O
a O
small O
place B-AS
exciting O
and O
I O
would O
not O
suggest O
that O
as O
a O
reason O
not O
to O
go O
. O

Prices B-AS
even O
outside O
of O
restaurant O
week O
were O
great O
. O

A O
small O
, O
outdoor B-AS
eating I-AS
area I-AS
makes O
for O
a O
private O
, O
comfortable O
space B-AS
to O
study O
alone O
or O
meet O
up O
with O
friends O
. O

Before O
the O
place O
did O
n't O
call O
my O
attention O
. O

And O
all O
the O
[ B-AS
female I-AS
] I-AS
servers I-AS
are O
cute O
too O
, O
which O
is O
always O
nice O
. O

The O
best O
dessert B-AS
, O
a O
chocolate B-AS
and I-AS
peanut I-AS
butter I-AS
tart I-AS
, O
is O
n't O
particularly O
Hawaiian O
, O
but O
it O
's O
a O
small O
world O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
sweets B-AS
. O

for O
an O
appetizer B-AS
, O
their O
calamari B-AS
is O
a O
winner O
. O

Satay O
is O
one O
of O
those O
favorite O
haunts O
on O
Washington O
where O
the O
service B-AS
and O
food B-AS
is O
always O
on O
the O
money O
. O

After O
dinner B-AS
I O
heard O
music B-AS
playing O
and O
discovered O
that O
there O
is O
a O
lounge B-AS
downstairs O
. O

But O
now O
that O
it O
's O
under O
new O
ownership O
and O
has O
been O
renovated O
, O
it O
looks O
great O
. O

The O
room B-AS
is O
a O
gorgeous O
, O
bi B-AS
- I-AS
level I-AS
space I-AS
and O
the O
long B-AS
bar I-AS
perfect O
for O
a O
drink B-AS
. O

Now O
we O
moved O
out O
of O
the O
state O
and O
every O
visit O
to O
NYC O
includes O
a O
stop O
here O
. O

Two O
complaints O
their O
appetizer B-AS
selection I-AS
stinks O
, O
it O
would O
be O
nice O
to O
get O
some O
mozzarella B-AS
sticks I-AS
on O
the O
menu B-AS
. O

I O
do O
n't O
remember O
what O
we O
had O
; O
nothing O
was O
memorable O
. O

It O
is O
bland O
and O
nothing O
extrodinary O
. O

I O
was O
especially O
impressed O
during O
the O
bday O
party O
when O
the O
waitstaff B-AS
went O
above O
and O
beyond O
in O
helping O
me O
decorate O
and O
bring O
out O
a O
bday O
cake O
as O
well O
as O
offering O
prompt O
and O
friendly O
service B-AS
to O
a O
15 O
person O
party O
. O

The O
chicken B-AS
and I-AS
falafel I-AS
platters I-AS
were O
nondescript O
combinations O
with O
fresh B-AS
leaf I-AS
salad I-AS
. O

Every O
time O
I O
visit O
NYC O
, O
I O
come O
here O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
been O
coming O
here O
regularly O
since O
it O
opened O
, O
about O
2 O
years O
ago O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
takes O
you O
to O
that O
place O
, O
the O
place O
many O
dream O
of O
. O

several O
times O
and O
put O
up O
with O
the O
waiters B-AS
bad O
manners O
, O
knowing O
that O
their O
job O
is O
n't O
easy O
. O

The O
service O
is O
great O
maybe O
even O
borderline O
nagging O
but O
at O
least O
you O
get O
attention O
, O
the O
desserts B-AS
are O
excellent O
and O
the O
coffee B-AS
is O
so O
very O
good O
. O

We O
were O
seated O
next O
to O
a O
couple O
whose O
kitchen O
was O
being O
renovated O
and O
we O
agreed O
since O
we O
're O
all O
foodies O
who O
eat O
out O
a O
lot O
, O
that O
this O
was O
n't O
a O
place O
we O
'd O
return O
to O
. O

They O
are O
served B-AS
on O
Focacchia B-AS
bread I-AS
and O
are O
to O
die O
for O
. O

While O
the O
smoothies B-AS
are O
a O
little O
big O
for O
me O
, O
the O
fresh B-AS
juices I-AS
are O
the O
best O
I O
have O
ever O
had O
! O

The O
food O
is O
just O
OKAY O
, O
and O
it O
's O
almost O
not O
worth O
going O
unless O
you O
're O
getting O
the O
pialla B-AS
, O
which O
is O
the O
only O
dish B-AS
that O
's O
really O
good O
. O

The O
guac O
is O
fresh O
, O
yet O
lacking O
flavor B-AS
, O
we O
like O
to O
add O
our O
fresh B-AS
salsa I-AS
into O
it O
. O

The O
new B-AS
menu I-AS
has O
a O
few O
creative O
items O
, O
they O
were O
smart O
enough O
to O
keep O
some O
of O
the O
old O
favorites O
but O
they O
raised O
the O
prices B-AS
, O
the O
staff O
is O
friendly O
most O
of O
the O
time O
, O
but O
I O
must O
agree O
with O
the O
person O
that O
wrote O
about O
their O
favorite O
words O
, O
No O
, O
ca O
n't O
, O
sorry O
, O
boy O
, O
they O
wo O
n't O
bend O
the O
rules O
for O
anyone O
. O

It O
only O
open O
for O
lunch B-AS
but O
the O
food B-AS
is O
so O
good O
! O

If O
you O
like O
seafood B-AS
and/or O
Greek B-AS
food I-AS
you O
will O
love O
this O
place O
though O
it O
is O
not O
limited O
to O
just O
these O
things O
. O

The O
menu B-AS
includes O
pub B-AS
fare I-AS
-- O
burgers B-AS
, O
steaks B-AS
and O
shepherds B-AS
pie I-AS
-- O
and O
even O
a O
portabella B-AS
lasagna I-AS
for O
those O
black O
sheep O
known O
as O
vegetarians O
. O

How O
can O
they O
survive O
serving O
mediocre O
food B-AS
at O
exorbitant O
prices B-AS
? O
! O

The O
food B-AS
was O
mediocre O
and O
the O
service B-AS
was O
severely O
slow O
. O

i O
have O
eaten O
here O
on O
a O
different O
occasion O
, O
the O
food B-AS
is O
mediocre O
for O
the O
prices B-AS
. O

I O
' O
m O
looking O
forward O
to O
going O
back O
soon O
and O
eventually O
trying O
most O
everything O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
! O

I O
just O
had O
my O
first O
visit O
to O
this O
place O
and O
ca O
n't O
wait O
to O
go O
back O
and O
slowly O
work O
my O
way O
through O
the O
menu B-AS
. O

I O
asked O
repeatedly O
what O
the O
status O
of O
the O
meal B-AS
was O
and O
was O
pretty O
much O
grunted O
at O
by O
the O
unbelievably O
rude O
waiter B-AS
. O

I O
stopped O
by O
for O
some O
brunch B-AS
today O
and O
had O
the O
vegan B-AS
cranberry I-AS
pancakes I-AS
and O
some O
rice B-AS
milk I-AS
. O

Weekends O
can O
get O
crowded O
, O
but O
still O
highly O
recommended O
. O

It O
gets O
very O
crowded O
so O
I O
would O
suggest O
that O
you O
get O
their O
early O
. O

Sweet O
Irish O
bartender B-AS
is O
always O
happy O
and O
able O
to O
bring O
a O
smile O
to O
my O
friends O
a O
my O
face O
. O

I O
always O
find O
myself O
sitting O
next O
to O
someone O
in O
the O
theatre O
industry O
interesting O
to O
hear O
ideas O
hashed O
out O
while O
having O
a O
quick O
bite O
to O
eat O
. O

Its O
good O
to O
go O
there O
for O
drink B-AS
if O
you O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
get O
drunk O
because O
you O
'll O
be O
lucky O
if O
you O
can O
get O
one O
drink B-AS
an O
hour O
the O
service B-AS
is O
so O
bad O
. O

Anyway O
, O
the O
owner B-AS
was O
fake O
. O

Owner B-AS
is O
pleasant O
and O
entertaining O
. O

I O
have O
never O
in O
my O
life O
sent O
back O
food B-AS
before O
, O
but O
I O
simply O
had O
to O
, O
and O
the O
waiter B-AS
argued O
with O
me O
over O
this O
. O

Although O
the O
restaurant O
itself O
is O
nice O
, O
I O
prefer O
not O
to O
go O
for O
the O
food B-AS
. O

Creamy B-AS
appetizers I-AS
-- O
taramasalata B-AS
, O

( I-AS
with I-AS

this O
place B-AS
to O
everyone O
. O

Great O
food B-AS
. O

One O
of O
my O
favorite O
places O
in O
Brooklyn O
. O

The O
pastas B-AS
are O
incredible O
, O
the O
risottos B-AS
particularly O
the O
sepia B-AS
are O
fantastic O
and O
the O
braised B-AS
rabbit I-AS
is O
amazing O
. O

Overpriced O
and O
not O
tasty O

The O
food B-AS
here O
was O
mediocre O
at O
best O
. O

It O
was O
totally O
overpriced O
fish B-AS
and I-AS
chips I-AS
was O
about O
$ O
15 O
. O

There O
are O
so O
many O
other O
great O
places O
to O
go O
to O
eat O
and O
drink O
this O
place O
is O
not O
worth O
it O
. O

Dog B-AS

I O

the O
main O
thing O

Trust O

Excellent O
food B-AS
, O
although O
the O
interior B-AS
could O
use O
some O
help O

The O
space B-AS
kind O
of O
feels O
like O
an O
Alice O
in O
Wonderland O
setting O
, O
without O
it O
trying O
to O
be O
that O
. O

I O
paid O

atmosphere B-AS
that O
makes O

the O
first O
visit O
. O

The O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
is O
very O
courteous O
and O
accomodating O
. O

The O
space B-AS
is O
limited O
so O
be O
prepared O
to O
wait O
up O
to O
45 O
minutes O
, O
1 O
hour O
, O
but O
be O
richly O
rewarded O
when O
you O
savor O
the O
delicious O
indo B-AS
- I-AS
chinese I-AS
food I-AS
. O

There O
are O
no O
negatives O
to O
speak O
of O
. O

the O
bestt O
! O

my O
favorite O
place B-AS
lol O

i O
love O
their O
chicken B-AS
pasta I-AS
ca O
n't O
remember O
the O
name O
but O
is O
sooo O
good O

its O
alright O

i O
m O
not O
necessarily O
fanatical O
about O
this O
place B-AS
, O
but O
it O
was O
a O
fun O
time O
for O
low O
pirces O
. O

lobster B-AS
was O
good O
, O
nothing O
spectacular O
. O

its O
just O
a O
fun O
place O
to O
go O
, O
not O
a O
five O
star O
restaraunt B-AS
. O

Way O
below O
average O

I O
think O
the O
pizza B-AS
is O
so O
overrated O
and O
was O
under O
cooked O
. O

Had O
no O
flavor O
and O
the O
staff B-AS
is O
rude O
and O
not O
attentive O
. O

Would O
NEVER O
go O
back O

I O
love O
this O
place B-AS

I O
was O
n't O
here O
for O
the O
pizza O
so O
I O
ca O
n't O
comment O
on O
that O
yet O
but O
what O
I O
had O
was O
very O
good O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
quick O
and O
friendly O
. O

Everyone O
was O
smiling O
so O
that O
made O
me O
feel O
welcome O
. O

I O
thought O
the O
restaurant B-AS
was O
nice O
and O
clean O
. O

I O
ordered O
the O
vitello B-AS
alla I-AS
marsala I-AS
and O
I O
was O
pretty O
impressed O
. O

The O
veal B-AS
and O
the O
mushrooms B-AS
were O
cooked O
perfectly O
. O

The O
potato B-AS
balls I-AS
were O
not O
dry O
at O
all O
in O
fact O
it O
was O
buttery O
. O

The O
only O
downside O
they O
only O
take O
cash O
which O
is O
OK O
if O
you O
know O
about O
it O
ahead O
of O
time O
. O

I O
'll O
be O
back O
for O
sure O
. O

WORST O

Very O
immature O
bartender B-AS

know O
how O
to O
make O
specific O
drinks O
, O
service B-AS
was O
so O
slowwwww O
, O
the O
food B-AS
was O
not O
fresh O
or O
warm O
, O
waitresses B-AS
were O
busy O
flirting O
with O
men O
at O
the O
bar O
and O
were O
nt O
very O
attentive O
to O
all O
the O
customers O

I O
would O
never O

for O
a O
casual O

overpriced O
japanese B-AS
food I-AS
with O
mediocre O
service B-AS

Went O
here O
on O

Too O
many O
other O
good O
places O
to O

the O
sushi B-AS
is O
consistently O
good O
, O
the O
service B-AS
is O
pleasant O
, O
effective O
and O
unassuming O
. O

In O
the O
summer O
months O
, O
the O
back B-AS
garden I-AS
area I-AS
is O
really O
nice O
. O

The O
rolls B-AS

Gross O
food B-AS
, O
Wow- O

I O
ca O
n't O
remember O
the O
last O
time O
I O
had O
such O
gross O
food B-AS
in O
New O
York O
. O

My O
quesadilla B-AS
tasted O
like O
it O
had O
been O
made O
by O
a O
three O
- O
year O
old O
with O
no O
sense O
of O
proportion O
or O
flavor O
. O

And O
$ O

on O
. O

Do O
n't O
get O
me O
started O
on O
the O
margaritas B-AS
, O
either O
. O

Mine O
tasted O
like O
the O
bartender O
had O
forgotten O
to O
add O
the O
tequila O
. O

Really O
, O
I O
find O
it O
rather O
scandalous O
that O
such O
a O
crappy O
restaurant O
attracts O
such O
crowds O
-- O
this O
, O
in O
the O
city O
of O
a O
million O
restaurants O
, O
at O
least O
9/10 O
of O
which O
are O
way O
better O
than O
this O
one O
. O

Save O
your O
money O
and O
your O
time O
and O
go O
somewhere O
else O
. O

Oh O
, O
and O
I O
never O
write O
reviews O
-- O
I O
just O
was O
so O
moved O
by O
how O
bad O
this O
place B-AS
was O
, O
I O
felt O
it O
was O
my O
duty O
to O
spread O
the O
word O
. O

. O

It O
's O
just O
average O
, O
just O

Best O
Indian B-AS
Restaurant I-AS
in O
the O
City O

Decor B-AS
needs O
to O
be O
upgraded O
but O
the O
food B-AS
is O
amazing O
! O

This O
small O
Astoria O
souvlaki O
spot O
makes O
what O
many O
consider O
the O
best O
gyros B-AS
in O
New O
York O
. O

Small O
, O
bright O
, O
and O
clean O
, O
BZ O
Grill O
stands O
apart O
from O
the O
usual O
run O
of O
gyro O
joints O
, O
both O
in O
Astoria O
and O
out O
. O

What O
really O
makes O
it O
shine O
is O
the O
food B-AS
, O
which O
is O
aggressively O
seasoned O
with O
Cyrpriot O
spices O
, O
and O
all O
made O
in O
- O
house O
even O
the O
gyro B-AS
meat I-AS
and O
sausages B-AS
, O
and O
made O
of O
much O
higher O
quality O
ingredients B-AS
that O
might O
otherwise O
be O
expected O
. O

All O
the O
various O
Greek B-AS
and I-AS
Cypriot I-AS
dishes I-AS
are O
excellent O
, O
but O
the O
gyro B-AS
is O
the O
reason O
to O
come O
-- O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
eat O
one O
your O
trip O
was O
wasted O
. O

Good O
Experience O

During O
our O
trip O
to O
NYC O
, O
we O
made O
reservations O
to O
dine O
in O
the O
pool O
room O
of O
the O
Four O
Seasons O
for O
their O
pre O
- O
theater O
menu O
offering O
a O
modified O
menu O
for O
$ O
65 O
pp O
. O

The O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
was O
extensive O
, O
though O
the O
staff B-AS
did O
not O
seem O
knowledgeable O
about O
wine O
pairings O
. O

The O
bread B-AS
we O
received O
was O
horrible O
, O
rock O
hard O
and O
cold O
, O
and O
the O
free O
appetizer B-AS
of I-AS
olives I-AS
was O
disappointing O
. O

However O
, O
our O
main B-AS
course I-AS
was O
wonderful O
. O

I O
had O
fish B-AS
and O
my O
husband O
had O
the O
filet B-AS
, O
both O
of O
which O
exceeded O
our O
expectations O
. O

The O
dessert O
we O
had O
a O
pear B-AS
torte I-AS
was O
good O
, O
but O
, O
once O
again O
, O
the O
staff B-AS
was O
unable O
to O
provide O
appropriate O
drink O
suggestions O
. O

When O
we O
inquired O
about O
ports O
, O
the O
waitress B-AS
listed O
off O
several O
but O
did O
not O
know O
taste O
variations O
or O
cost O
. O

Not O
what O
I O
would O
expect O
for O
the O
price O
and O
prestige O
of O
this O
location B-AS
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
I O
would O
return O
, O
as O
it O
was O
a O
beautiful O
restaurant B-AS
, O
but O
I O
hope O
the O
staff B-AS
pays O
more O
attention O
to O
the O
little O
details O
in O
the O
future O
. O

short O
and O
sweet O
, O
seating B-AS
is O
great O
, O
it O
's O
romantic O
, O
cozy O
and O
private O
. O

The O

are O
not O
as O
small O
as O
some O
of O
the O

make O
them O
out O
to O
look O
they O
're O
perfect O

I O
barely O
understood O
1 O
word O
when O
the O
waiter B-AS
took O
our O
order O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
ok O
and O
fair O
nothing O
to O
go O
crazy O
. O

over O
. O

Over O
all O
the O
looks B-AS
of O
the O
place O
exceeds O
the O
actual O
meals B-AS
. O

So O
what O
you O
really O
end O
up O
paying O
for O
is O
the O
restaurant B-AS
not O
the O
food B-AS
. O

Will O
prob O
not O
return O
but O
it O
is O
a O
great O
dinning O
experience O
to O
try O
atleast O
once O
. O

Impressed O
. O

Subtle O
food B-AS
and O
service B-AS

Noodle O
pudding O
is O
exactly O
the O
type O
of O
service B-AS
and O
food B-AS
I O
enjoy O
. O

Servers O
are O
all O
different O
, O
Greg B-AS
is O
my O
favorite O
. O

Sometimes O
tables O
do O
n't O
understand O
his O
sense O
of O
humor O
but O
it O
's O
refreshing O
to O
have O
a O
server B-AS
who O
has O
personality O
, O
professionalism O
, O
and O
respects O
the O
privacy O
of O
your O
dinner O
. O

This O
is O
the O
first O
place O
I O
' O
ve O
been O
that O
a O
runner B-AS
remembers O
my O
order O
hope O
he O
likes O
his O
job O
because O
I O
have O
half O
a O
mind O
to O
steal O
him O
for O
my O
restaurant O
. O

Prices O
are O
fair O
across O
the O
board O
for O
both O
food B-AS
and O
bev B-AS
. O

I O
go O
out O
to O
eat O
and O
like O
my O
courses O
, O
servers B-AS
are O
patient O
and O
never O
rush O
courses O
or O
force O
another O
drink O
. O

Stepping O
into O
Casa B-AS
La I-AS
Femme I-AS
last O
night O
was O
a O
true O
experience O
unlike O
any O
other O
in O
New O
York O
! O

Highly O
impressed O
from O
the O
decor B-AS
to O
the O
food B-AS
to O
the O
hospitality O
to O
the O
great O
night O
I O
had O

lemon I-AS
and I-AS
lime I-AS

and I-AS

that O
is O
to O
die O
for O
! O

Food B-AS
took O
some O
time O
to O
prepare O
, O
all O
worth O
waiting O
for O
. O

We O
were O
drawn O
into O
the O
belly B-AS
dancing I-AS
show I-AS
that O
captivated O
the O
crowd O
. O

I O
never O
write O
on O
these O
sites O
but O
this O
restaurant B-AS
is O
def O
worth O
commending O
! O

Great O
find O
in O
the O
West O
Village O
! O

Maggot O
in O
the O
food B-AS
! O

I O
' O
ve O
been O
wanting O
to O
go O
to O
this O
place O
forever O
and O
finally O
got O
a O
table O
. O

The O
menu B-AS
looked O
great O
, O
and O
the O
waiter B-AS
was O
very O
nice O
, O
but O
when O
the O
food B-AS
came O
, O
it O
was O
average O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
I O
finished O
my O
plate O
, O
and O
that O
's O
when O
I O
found O
a O
maggot O
in O
mushroom B-AS
sauce I-AS
at O
the O
bottom O
. O

I O
showed O
it O
to O
the O
manager B-AS
, O
and O
he O
smilingly O
apologized O
and O
brought O
us O
two O
free O
desserts O
but O
did O
not O
ask O
us O
what O
we O
wanted O
and O
so O
brought O
the O
last O
two O
desserts O
we O
would O
have O
asked O
for O
. O

When O
the O
bill O
came O
, O
nothing O
was O
comped O
, O
so O
I O
told O
the O
manager O
very O
politely O
that O
we O
were O
willing O
to O
pay O
for O
the O
wine O
, O
but O
I O
did O
n't O
think O
I O
should O
have O
to O
pay O
for O
food O
with O
a O
maggot O
in O
it O
. O

Yes O
, O
I O
ate O
the O
food O
, O
but O
I O
certainly O
would O
not O
have O
if O
I O
had O
seen O
the O
maggot O
before O
eating O
, O
and O
I O
was O
at O
this O
point O
fairly O
sick O
to O
my O
stomach O
. O

The O
manager B-AS
finally O
said O
he O
would O
comp O
the O
two O
glasses O
of O
wine O
which O
cost O
less O
than O
the O
food O
, O
and O
made O
it O
seem O
like O
a O
big O
concession O
. O

We O
paid O
and O
left O
because O
we O
did O
n't O
feel O
like O
arguing O
any O
more O
. O

I O
have O
worked O
in O
restaurants O
and O
cook O
a O
lot O
, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
way O
a O
maggot O
should O
be O
able O
to O
get O
into O
well O
prepared O
food B-AS
. O

For O
a O
restaurant B-AS
with O
such O
a O
good O
reputation O
and O
that O
is O
usually O
so O
packed O
, O
there O
was O
no O
reason O
for O
such O
a O
lack O
of O
intelligent O
customer B-AS
service I-AS
. O

A O
fairly O
late O
entry O
into O
the O
haute O
barnyard O
sweepstakes O
, O
Flatbush O
Farm O
is O
n't O
in O
the O
same O
league O
as O
the O
Blue O
Hills O
or O
even O
the O
Farm O
on O
Adderlys O
of O
the O
world O
, O
but O
it O
's O
pretty O
good O
, O
albeit O
with O
a O
somewhat O
dismal O
setting O
. O

Unhygienic O

I O
do O
not O
recommend O
. O

I O
went O
there O
2times O
. O

I O
got O
hair O
in O
my O
food B-AS
2 O
times O
of O

! O

Great O
place B-AS
, O
great O
value O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
flavorful O
, O
plentiful O
and O
reasonably O
priced O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
relaxed O
and O
casual O
. O

It O
's O
a O
great O
place B-AS
to O
order O
from O
or O
sit O

Yamato B-AS

not O
into O

or O
if O
you O

They O

great O
rolls B-AS

the O

are O
awesome O
and O
filling O
. O

One O
special B-AS

one O

is O
enough O
to O
fill O
you O
up O

I O
' O
ve O
had O
my O
fair O
share O
of O
modern B-AS
Japanese I-AS
and O
this O
spot O
delivers O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
was O
pretty O
nice O
but O
had O
a O
bit O
lacking O
, O
which O
it O
tries O
to O
make O
up O
for O
with O
a O
crazy O
scheme B-AS
of I-AS
mirrors I-AS
. O

If O
you O
're O
into O
being O
lost O
when O
you O
're O
just O
five O
feet O
from O
your O
table O
then O
hey O
, O
that O
's O
a O
good O
thing O
. O

Despite O
the O
confusing O
mirrors B-AS
this O
will O
likely O
be O
my O
go O
- O
to O
for O
modern B-AS
Japanese I-AS
food I-AS
for O
the O
foreseeable O
future O
. O

Another O
review O

it O
is O

Indo B-AS
Chinese I-AS
food I-AS
, O
pretty O
good O
. O

Not O
a O
very O
fancy O
place B-AS
but O
very O
good O
Chinese B-AS
style I-AS
Indian I-AS
food I-AS
. O

The O
chicken B-AS
lollipop I-AS
is O
my O
favorite O
, O
most O
of O
the O
dishes B-AS
I O
have O
to O
agree O
with O
a O
previous O
reviewer O
are O
quite O
oily O
and O
very O
spicy O
, O
espeically O
the O
Chilli B-AS
Chicken I-AS
. O

My O
mom O
originally O
introduced O
me O
to O
this O
place O
, O
but O
even O
she O
being O
Indian O
feels O
the O
food B-AS
can O
be O
somewhat O
over O
the O
top O
spicy O
and O
far O
too O
oily O
. O

Still O
we O
keep O
going O
back O
, O

I O
was O
speechless O
by O
the O
horrible O
food B-AS
. O

I O
attended O
a O
holiday O
dinner O
at O
the O
restaurant O
, O
and O
the O
food B-AS
was O
majorly O
disappointing O
. O

Rather O
than O
eating O
the O
meat O
entree O
being O
offered O
, O
I O
requested O
a O
vegetarian O
dish O
. O

Rather O
than O
preparing O
vegetarian B-AS
dish I-AS
, O
the O
chef B-AS
presented O
me O
with O
a O
plate O
of O
steamed O
vegetables O
minus O
sauce O
, O
seasoning O
, O
or O
any O
form O
or O
aesthetic O
presentation O
. O

I O
was O
so O
stunned O
, O
and O
I O
left O
the O
dinner O
hungry O
and O
majorly O
disappointing O
. O

This O
place B-AS
survives O
on O
reputation O
alone O
. O

I O
will O
NEVER O
return O
. O

There O

Expensive O

worth O

it O
and O
there O
is O
Expensive O

and O

WTF O
? O

This O
is O
a O
twenty O

Are O
you O
freaking O
kidding O
me O
? O

Look O
, O
the O
appetizers B-AS
were O
really O
good O
. O

The O
entree B-AS
was O
also O
very O
good O
. O

Ca O
n't O
argue O
about O
that O
, O
but O
they O
are O
clearly O
over O
priced O
. O

What O
you O
are O
paying O
for O
is O
the O
environment B-AS
and O
the O
name O
. O

Yes O
, O
the O
place B-AS
is O
classy O
and O
beautiful O
, O
but O
they O
most O
certainly O
target O
the O
uber O
whealthy O
Not O
the O
common O
joe O
that O
wants O
to O
go O
all O
out O
every O

Not O

at O

I O
read O

that O
called O
the O

too O
expensive O

I O
thought O
to O
myself O
, O
but O
may O
be O
it O
is O
worth O
it O
. O

I O
was O
wrong O
. O

The B-AS
Four I-AS
Seasons I-AS
has O
history O
and O
it O
is O
a O
sort O
of O
landmark O
of O
New O
York O
City O
restaurants O
, O
but O
trust O
me O
, O
they O
will O
charge O
you O
through O
the O
nose O
just O
so O
that O
you O
can O
say O
I O
' O
ve O
been O
to O
the O
four O
seasons O
restaurant O
. O

I O
wanted O
to O
go O
there O
to O
see O
if O
it O
was O
worth O
it O
and O
sadly O
, O
curiousity O
got O
the O
best O
of O
me O
and O
I O
paid O
dearly O
for O
it O
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
the O
food B-AS
was O
great O
except O
for O
the O
dessserts B-AS
. O

The O
environment B-AS
is O
very O
upscale O
and O
you O
will O
see O
a O
lot O
of O
rich O
guys O
with O
trophy O
wives O
or O
just O
highly O
paid O
escorts O
. O

If O
you O
are O
going O
for O
the O
food B-AS
, O
it O
will O
not O
be O
worth O
it O
. O

Yes O
, O
it O
is O
good O
, O
but O
I O
' O
ve O
had O
better O
for O
cheaper O
. O

You O
would O
think O
they O
would O
make O
up O
for O
it O
with O
service B-AS
, O
sadly O
, O
no O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
just O
ok O
, O
it O
is O
not O
what O
you O
'd O
expect O
for O
$ O
500 O
. O

Terrible O
Waste O
of O
money O
scammers O
. O

I O
agree O
that O
dining O
at O
Casa B-AS
La I-AS
Femme I-AS
is O
like O
no O
other O
dining O
experience O
! O

BUT O
not O
in O
a O
good O
way O
. O

I O
am O
actually O
offended O
to O
have O
spent O
so O
much O
money O
on O
such O
a O
bad O
experience O
. O

I O
literally O
just O
got O
back O
home O
after O
visiting O
Casa B-AS
La I-AS
Femme I-AS
and O
was O
so O
offended O
by O
my O
visit O
felt O
it O
necessary O
to O
try O
and O
warn O
other O
diners O
who O
value O
their O
money O
and O
time O
. O

We O
went O
to O
celebrate O
two O
birthdays O
and O
wanted O
to O
do O
something O
special O
and O
different O
. O

Our O
visit O
their O
to O
say O
the O
least O
, O
was O
an O
unpleasant O
and O
costly O
experience O
! O

And O
even O
more O
so O
unpleasant O
because O
it O
was O
so O
costly O
for O
such O
an O
unpleasant O
experience O
. O

We O
did O
arrive O
late O
for O
our O
reservation O
so O
I O
can O
not O
complain O
too O
much O
about O
the O
wait B-AS
for O
a O
table O
. O

Although O
we O
were O
told O
10 O
- O
15 O
minutes O
and O
it O
was O
more O
like O
45 O
minutes O
. O

We O
were O
ushered O
to O
the O
bar O
to O
wait O
momentarily O
and O
upon O
arrival O
were O
so O
excited O
. O

The O
place B-AS
is O
beautiful O
! O

The O
hostess B-AS
was O
very O
pleasant O
. O

However O
, O
our O
$ O
14 O
drinks B-AS
were O
were O
horrible O
! O

Once O
we O
finally O
got O
a O
table O
, O
despite O
indicating O
we O
wanted O
an O
alla O
carte O
menu O
we O
were O
pushed O
into O
a O
table O
that O
was O
only O
price O
fixed O
! O

Since O
we O
were O
already O
waiting O
so O
long O
, O
we O
felt O
we O
had O
no O
other O
choice O
but O
to O
accept O
it O
. O

Our O
experience O
did O
not O
ever O
get O
any O
better O
. O

For O
each O
course O
we O
waited O
over O
1/2 O
hour O
to O
45 O
minutes O
and O
were O
never O
offered O
a O
drink O
. O

We O
also O
asked O
for O
Hooka O
six O
times O
and O
the O
waiter B-AS
kept O
telling O
us O
one O
minute O
and O
never O
returning O
with O
the O
Hooka O
. O

After O
the O
4th O
time O
i O
asked O
again O
and O
the O
waiter B-AS
than O
said O
after O
our O
dinner O
. O

We O
asked O
for O
beverages O
and O
never O
received O
them O
. O

We O
asked O
for O
sides O
which O
the O
waiter B-AS
than O
admitted O
that O
he O
forgot O
to O
put O
in O
that O
part O
of O
our O
order O
. O

My O
chicken B-AS
was O
inedible O
as O
there O
were O
so O
many O
fatty O
lumps O
which O
i O
had O
to O
keep O
spitting O
out O
into O
my O
napkin O
. O

I O
would O
not O
expect O
this O
for O
a O
$ O
55 O
dinner B-AS
. O

By O
the O
time O
we O
finished O
our O
dinner O
we O
still O
had O
not O
received O
one O
beverage O
NOR O
hooka O
! O

What O
we O
did O
do O
was O
waste O
3 O
hours O
being O
trapped O
in O
a O
table O
waiting O
and O
waiting O
for O
food O
and O
drinks O
and O
hooka O
some O
of O
which O
we O
never O
received O
! O
. O

The O
only O
beverage O
we O
did O
receive O
was O
water O
in O
dirty O
glasses O
! O

To O
top O
it O
all O
off O
the O
main O
reason O
we O
came O
to O
your O
restaurant O
was O
for O
the O
belly O
dancers O
and O
missed O
the O
first O
show O
as O
we O
were O
not O
seated O
yet O
and O
the O
2nd O
belly O
dancer O
only O
danced O
at O
two O
tables O
in O
the O
back O
of O
the O
restaurant O
and O
never O
made O
it O
around O
to O
the O
other O
half O
of O
the O
restaurant O
. O

By O
the O
time O
we O
left O
our O
wallets O
were O
empy O
and O
so O
were O
our O
stomachs O
AND O
we O
missed O
the O
show O
we O
were O
supposed O
to O
see O
following O
our O
dinner O
, O
which O
would O
have O
been O
acceptable O
if O
we O
got O
to O
enjoy O
the O
experience O
of O
good O
food B-AS
and O
belly O
dancers O
! O

If O
it O
seemed O
possible O
to O
do O
so O
while O
there O
I O
would O
have O
fought O
my O
bill O
since O
my O
dinner O
portion O
of O
my O
meal B-AS
was O
inedible O
! O

I O
have O
never O
left O
a O
restaurant B-AS
feeling O
as O
if O
i O
was O
abused O
, O
and O
wasted O
my O
hard O
earned O
money O
. O

MY O
husbands O
birthday O
and O
my O
sons O
was O
not O
as O
it O
was O
intended O
and O
we O
drove O
two O
hours O
to O
spend O
too O
much O
money O
to O
be O
treated O
terribly O
! O
. O

I O
wish O
I O
COULD O
be O
refunded O
! O

Do O
n't O
go O
with O
a O
larger O
group O
than O
4 O
! O

I O
went O
here O
for O
a O
family O
birthday O
dinner O
. O

Five O
of O
us O
walked O
in O
at O
approximately O
6 O
, O
20 O
on O
a O
Thursday O
evening O
. O

The O
hostess O
said O
Wow O
that O
's O
a O
large O
group O
, O
unless O
you O
are O
n't O
together O
, O
to O
which O
I O
replied O
no O
we O
are O
, O
and O
there O
will O
be O
one O
more O
, O
so O
a O
table O
for O
six O
please O
. O

At O
first O
we O
were O
a O
little O
taken O
aback O
, O
as O
this O
seemed O
to O
present O
a O
problem O
, O
although O
the O
restaurant O
looked O
fairly O
empty O
, O
but O
they O
hastily O
put O
the O
table O
together O
for O
us O
. O

The O
menu B-AS
is O
fairly O
simple O
without O
much O
descriptions O
. O

There O
was O
no O
tap O
beer B-AS
that O
evening O
, O
which O
was O
a O
disappointment O
. O

Not O
much O
of O
a O
selection B-AS
of I-AS
bottled I-AS
beer I-AS
either O
, O
we O
went O
with O
Brahma O
. O

The O
appetizers O
we O
ordered O
were O
served O
quickly O
, O
an O
order O
of O
fried B-AS
oysters I-AS
and I-AS
clams I-AS
were O
delicious O
but O
a O
tiny O
portion O
maybe O
3 O
of O
each O
. O

The O
lobster B-AS
knuckles I-AS
special O
of O
the O
day O
were O
ok O
, O
but O
pretty O
tasteless O
. O

I O
believe O
there O
were O
2 O
shrimp O
in O
the O
" B-AS
salt I-AS
encrusted I-AS
shrimp I-AS
" I-AS
appetizer I-AS
. O

After O
we O
ate O
our O
appetizers O
which O
took O
all O
of O
8 O
minutes O
we O
ordered O
another O
round O
of O
Brahma O
's O
, O
and O
tried O
to O
stall O
a O
little O
as O
we O
waited O
for O
our O
sixth O
dinner O
member O
. O

The O
waitress O
appeared O
and O
asked O
us O
if O
we O
wanted O
to O
go O
ahead O
and O
order O
. O

We O
replied O
that O
we O
would O
like O
to O
wait O
5 O
more O
minutes O
if O
that O
was O
okay O
. O

She O
replied O
well O
it O
would O
be O
more O
convenient O
for O
us O
if O
you O
ordered O
now O
, O
since O
you O
are O
a O
larger O
party O
, O
and O
it O
might O
get O
crowded O
. O

We O
called O
the O
other O
person O
who O
was O
very O
close O
by O
, O
and O
she O
told O
us O
to O
order O
for O
her O
, O
so O
we O
did O
. O

The O
food O
arrived O
in O
about O
15 O
minutes O
. O

I O
had O
the O
Thai B-AS
style I-AS
Fried I-AS
Sea I-AS
Bass I-AS
was O
very O
good O
. O

Everyone O
seemed O
generally O
happy O
with O
their O
food B-AS
, O
except O
my O
brother O
who O
had O
the O
grilled B-AS
Mahi I-AS
Mahi I-AS
, O
seemingly O
drenched O
in O
Grapfruit O
Juice O
! O

I O
heard O
the O
lobster B-AS
roll I-AS
was O
excellent O
. O

They O
seemed O
to O
continue O
to O
rush O
us O
along O
, O
taking O
plates O
without O
asking O
if O
we O
were O
done O
my O
sister O
still O
had O
her O
fork O
in O
hand O
. O

All O
in O
all O
the O
food B-AS
was O
good O
, O
a O
little O
on O
the O
expensive O
side O
, O
but O
fresh O
. O

Service B-AS
not O
the O
friendliest O
to O
our O
large O
party O
! O

Probably O
would O
not O
go O
back O
here O
. O

Great O
Indian B-AS
food I-AS

I O
lived O
on O
50th O
st O
, O
and O
wanted O
Indian O
one O
day O
so O
decided O
to O
check O
this O
place O
out O
. O

Food B-AS
was O
amazing O
, O
I O
love O
Indian O
food O
and O
eat O
it O
quite O
regularly O
, O
but O
I O
can O
say O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
I O
' O
ve O
had O
. O

Very O
normal O
Indian B-AS
food I-AS
, O
but O
done O
really O
well O
. O

I O
have O
it O
a O
4 O
instead O
of O
5 O
because O
of O
the O
price O
just O
chicken B-AS
tikka I-AS
masala I-AS
, O
no O
bread O
of O
rice O
, O
is O
$ O
25 O
, O
which O
I O
would O
expect O
at O
a O
upscale O
Indian O
restaurant O
but O
this O
place B-AS
does O
n't O
have O
an O
upscale O
feel B-AS
. O

Also O
, O
waiters B-AS
try O
to O
push O
more O
food O
on O
you O
, O
like O
suggest O
things O
as O
if O
they O
are O
complimentary O
when O
they O
actually O
cost O
$ O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
appreciate O
places O
or O
people O
that O
try O
to O
drive O
up O
the O
bill O
without O
the O
patron O
's O
knowledge O
so O
that O
was O
a O
huge O
turnoff O
more O
than O
the O
price O
. O

But O
if O
you O
're O
prepared O
to O
spend O
some O
$ O
and O
remember O
to O
ask O
if O
something O
they O
offer O
is O
complimentary O
, O
then O
this O
is O
the O
place B-AS
to O
go O
for O
Indian B-AS
food I-AS

Wretched O
and O
retching O

This O
will O
be O
only O
the O
third O
online O
review O
I O
have O
ever O
made O
about O
a O
restaurant O
in O
my O
life O
. O

They O
have O
all O
been O
tonight O
and O
they O
have O
all O
been O
about O
the O
same O
restaurant O
. O

I O
have O
never O
been O
so O
disgusted O
by O
both O
food B-AS
an O
service B-AS
. O

For O
starters O
they O
delivered O
us O
someone O
else O
's O
order O
. O

Fine O
, O
I O
wo O
nt O
hang O
you O
for O
that O
. O

However O
, O
once O
I O
received O
my O
predictably O
mediocre O
order O
of O
what O
Dokebi O
thinks O
passes O
as O
Korean B-AS
fair I-AS
, O
sometimes O
you O
have O
to O
settle O
when O
it O
's O
your O
only O
option O
, O
I O
got O
through O
about O
half O
my O
kimchee B-AS
before O
I O
found O
a O
piece O
of O
random O
lettuce O
accompanied O
by O
a O
far O
more O
disgusting O
, O
slimy O
, O
clearly O
bad O
piece O
of O
fish O
skin O
. O

Not O
one O
to O
jump O
to O
complaints O
hence O
my O
lack O
of O
previous O
online O
reviewing O
, O
I O
called O
the O
restaurant O
to O
give O
them O
a O
heads O
up O
that O
their O
kitchen O
might O
want O
to O
check O
the O
cleanliness O
of O
their O
prep O
stations O
. O

My O
main O
concern O
was O
the O
sanity O
of O
the O
food B-AS
that O
was O
being O
sent O
out O
to O
myself O
and O
others O
, O
but O
I O
would O
be O
lying O
is O
I O
said O
that O
as O
someone O
who O
has O
worked O
in O
restaurants O
since O
the O
age O
of O
fifteen O
I O
was O
expecting O
at O
least O
a O
minimal O
effort O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
restaurant O
to O
amend O
the O
situation O
. O

None O
was O
made O
so O
i O
hung O
up O
. O

Less O
than O
three O
minutes O
passed O
before O
I O
found O
myself O
doubled O
over O
the O
toilet O
. O

My O
girlfriend O
, O
being O
slightly O
more O
aggressive O
, O
and O
having O
been O
equally O
disgusted O
causing O
her O
to O
throw O
out O
the O
remainder O
of O
her O
barely O
eaten O
meal B-AS
, O
called O
back O
only O
to O
be O
informed O
that O
I O
was O
probably O
wrong O
and O
that O
it O
was O
most O
likely O
an O
oyster O
, O
and O
that O
we O
were O
also O
blacklisted O
from O
their O
restaurant O
. O

Not O
only O
have O
I O
worked O
in O
restaurants O
for O
many O
years O
, O
I O
am O
now O
in O
culinary O
school O
, O
I O
am O
a O
huge O
lover O
of O
oysters O
and O
fish O
, O
and O
my O
girlfriend O
is O
half O
Korean O
! O

We O
know O
the O
difference O
between O
and O
oyster O
and O
bad O
fish O
. O

It O
was O
n't O
as O
if O
this O
restaurant B-AS
had O
any O
major O
bragging O
points O
before O
hand O
, O
but O
now O
it O
's O
simply O
repulsive O
. O

Eat O
at O
your O
own O
risk O
. O

Gorgeous O
place B-AS
ideal O
for O
a O
romantic O
dinner O

I O
took O
my O
boyfriend O
for O
a O
dinner O
on O
saturday O
night O
. O

I O
book O
a O
gorgeous O
white B-AS
organza I-AS
tent I-AS
which O
included O
a O
four B-AS
course I-AS
prix I-AS
fix I-AS
menu I-AS
which O
we O
enjoyed O
a O
lot O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
spectacular O
as O
the O
waiter B-AS
knew O
everything O
about O
the O
menu O
and O
his O
recommendations O
were O
amazing O
! O

I O
completely O
recommend O
Casa B-AS
La I-AS
Femme I-AS
for O
any O
special O
occasion O
and O
to O
REALLY O
impress O
your O
date O

- O
bokum O
. O

The O
dishes O
came O
out O
around O
5 O
minutes O
apart O
. O

The O
bibimbap B-AS
was O
average O
, O
but O
the O
stone B-AS
bowl I-AS
was O
n't O
even O
close O
to O
sizzling O
. O

Too O
bad O
I O
had O
paid O
an O
extra O
$ O
2 O
for O
the O
stone B-AS
bowl I-AS
. O

The O
nakgi B-AS
- I-AS
bokum I-AS
was O
horrible O
. O

Easily O
the O
worst O
stir B-AS
- I-AS
fried I-AS
squid I-AS
I O
' O
ve O
ever O
tasted O
. O

The O
sauce B-AS
tasted O
more O
like O
Chinese O
fast O
food O
than O
decent O
Korean O
. O

The O
side B-AS
dishes I-AS
were O
passable O
, O
and O
I O
did O
get O
a O
refill O
upon O
request O
. O

The O
real O
problem O
I O
had O
with O
this O
place O
was O
the O
complete O
lack O
of O
service B-AS
. O

I O
mentioned O
the O
squid O
dish O
was O
n't O
very O
good O
when O
the O
waitress O
visited O
. O

She O
just O
nodded O
and O
walked O
off O
. O

There O
were O
no O
communications O
issues O
either O
, O
as O
she O
spoke O
perfect O
English O
. O

As O
to O
my O
comment O
about O
the O
food O
, O
no O
apology O
or O
acknowledgment O
was O
made O
. O

My O
wife O
had O
barely O
touched O
that O
mess O
of O
a O
dish B-AS
. O

We O
were O
charged O
full O
price O
. O

If O
you O
ware O
looking O
for O
Korean O
fusion O
, O
I O
suggest O
you O
try O
some O
of O
the O
places O
in O
the O
East O
Village O
. O

Authentic O
Korean O
food O
lovers O
should O
visit O
32nd O

Lives O
up O
to O
the O
hype O

We O
' O
ve O
lived O
around O
the O
corner O
from O
this O
place O
for O
over O
a O
year O
and O
finally O
had O
dinner O
there O
. O

We O
' O
ve O
tried O
before O
but O
it O
always O
packed O
and O
does O
n't O
take O
reservations O
. O

It O
was O
well O
worth O
the O
wait O
. O

The O
wife O
had O
the O
risotto B-AS
which O
was O
amazing O
. O

It O
does O
n't O
look O
appetizing O
as O
it O
's O
covered O
in O
squid O
ink O
and O
it O
turns O
your O
lips O
and O
teeth O
black O
, O
but O
the O
taste O
was O
phenomenal O
. O

The O
farro B-AS
salad I-AS
and O
the O
mashed B-AS
yukon I-AS
potatoes I-AS
were O
also O
extremely O
tasty O
. O

i O
love O

Love O
this O
place B-AS
, O
every O
time O
we O
are O
in O
the O
city O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
place B-AS
we O
always O
go O
. O

A O
quintessential O
slice B-AS
of I-AS
NYC I-AS
pizza I-AS
. O

The O
crust B-AS
has O
a O
great O
bite O
and O
a O
good O
chew O
, O
the O
sauce B-AS
is O
light O
with O
a O
nice O
acidity O
to O
it O
, O
the O
salt O
from O
the O
cheese B-AS
is O
great O
, O
really O
heightens O
the O
flavor O
of O
all O
the O
other O
components O
. O

Personally O
I O
like O
the O
margherita B-AS
pizza I-AS
better O
, O
but O
they O
are O
all O
good O
. O

Possibly O
the O
Most O
Romantic O
Restaurant B-AS
in O
the O
City O

This O
is O
undoubtedly O
my O
favorite O
modern B-AS
Japanese I-AS
brasserie I-AS
that O
do O
n't O
serve O
sushi O
, O
and O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
one O
of O
the O
most O
romantic O
restaurants O
in O
the O
city O
! O

Not O
only O
is O
it O
an O
adventure O
getting O
to O
this O
somewhat O
hidden O
spot B-AS
, O
once O
you O
enter O
the O
unmarked B-AS
wooden I-AS
doors I-AS
, O
the O
zen O
and O
intimate O
decor B-AS
will O
make O
you O
feel O
like O
you O
're O
no O
longer O
in O
the O
city O
. O

If O
you O
're O
planning O
to O
come O
here O
, O
make O
sure O
that O
your O
date O
is O
someone O
whom O
you O
really O
like O
since O
you O
'll O
be O
ushered O
to O
private B-AS
booths I-AS
where O
there O
will O
be O
no O
people O
or O
food O
watching O
choose O
the O
ones O
on O
the O
ground O
level O
that O
have O
glass B-AS
ceilings I-AS
so O
you O
may O
see O
the O
stars O
in O
the O
sky O
! O
. O

It O
's O
just O
you O
and O
your O
date O
and O
an O
occasional O
cute O
excuse O
me O
before O
the O
waiter B-AS
opens O
the O
little O
curtain O
to O
your O
booth O
! O

My O
party O
had O
the O
BBE B-AS
$ I-AS
29 I-AS
fixe I-AS
prix I-AS
menu I-AS
, O
which O
was O
such O
a O
wonderful O
deal O
since O
it O
also O
came O
with O
a O
flight O
of O
sake O
! O

I O
never O
used O
to O
be O
a O
fan O
of O
sakes O
but O
am O
lately O
experimenting O
with O
it O
a O
lot O
more O
and O
am O
acquiring O
a O
better O
taste O
of O
it O
. O

We O
started O
off O
with O
a O
delightful O
sashimi B-AS
amuse I-AS
bouche I-AS
. O

Our O
first O
course O
was O
Tuna O
Sashimi O
with O
Green O
Yuzu O
Sauce O
. O

I O
picked O
the O
Grilled B-AS
Black I-AS
Cod I-AS
as O
my O
entree O
, O
which O
I O
absolutely O
devoured O
while O
someone O
commented O
that O
the O
Grilled B-AS
Salmon I-AS
dish I-AS
was O
better O
. O

The O
entrees B-AS
were O
served O
with O
miso O
soup O
and O
rice O
. O

The O
sake B-AS
's I-AS
complimented O
the O
courses O
very O
well O
and O
is O
successfully O
easing O
me O
into O
the O
sake O
world O
. O

For O
desserts O
, O
we O
tried O
the O
frozen B-AS
black I-AS
sesame I-AS
mousse I-AS
interesting O
but O
not O
extraordinary O
and O
matcha B-AS
( I-AS
powdered I-AS
green I-AS
tea I-AS
) I-AS
and I-AS
blueberry I-AS
cheesecake I-AS
, O
which O
was O
phenomenal O
. O

Maybe O
it O
was O
the O
great O
company O
I O
had O
friends O
visiting O
from O
Philly O
, O
yes O
, O
it O
was O
not O
a O
date O
this O
time O
or O
the O
super O
reasonable O
price O
point O
, O
but O
I O
just O
ca O
n't O
say O
enough O
good O
things O
about O
this O
brasserie B-AS
. O

I O
do O
n't O
usually O
visit O
the O
same O
establishment O
more O
than O
once O
, O
what O
more O
twice O
, O
but O
I O
'll O
come O
to O
Zenkichi B-AS
anytime O
for O
a O
quiet O
, O
unhurried O
and O
memorable O
dinner O
. O

Terrible O
would O
be O
a O
compliment O
! O

The O
service B-AS
leaves O
much O
to O
be O
desired O
, O
from O
feeling O
like O
you O
are O
rushed O
the O
place O
your O
order O
, O
to O
being O
ignored O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
night O
. O

We O
were O
10 O
people O
celebrtating O
a O
birthday O
, O
we O
sat O
in O
the O
tent O
. O

We O
paid O
a O
fixed O
pricce O
but O
got O
nothing O
! O
! O

We O
never O
ate O
because O
by O
close O
to O
2 O
in O
the O
monring O
we O
were O
not O
served O
and O
were O
too O
upset O
ad O
tired O
to O
start O
eating O
. O

They O
are O
extremely O
rude O
, O
not O
even O
apologizing O
for O
the O
horrible O
service B-AS
we O
got O
and O
handing O
us O
a O
bill O
well O
over O
$ O
500 O
for O
some O
drinks B-AS
adn O
their O
pita B-AS
bread I-AS
! O

Stay O

Great O
Shabu B-AS
Shabu I-AS

I O
go O
here O
at O
least O
once O
every O
other O
week O
, O
particularly O
when O
it O
's O
cold O
! O

I O
love O
it O
. O

To O
be O
honest O
we O
only O
ever O
eat O
the O
Shabu O
Shabu O
. O

I O
tried O
a O
couple O
other O
dishes B-AS
but O
was O
n't O
too O
impressed O
. O

But O
for O
the O
Shabu B-AS
Shabu I-AS
, O
you O
wo O
n't O
find O
much O
better O
in O
NY O
. O

In O
fact O
there O
is O
only O
one O
I O
' O
ve O
tried O
that O
even O
compares O
shabu O
Tatsu O
and O
even O
then O
I O
prefer O
Dokebi O
. O

The O
meat B-AS
is O
fresh O
, O
the O
sauces B-AS
are O
great O
, O
you O
get O
kimchi B-AS
and O
a O
salad B-AS
free O
with O
your O
meal B-AS
and O
service B-AS
is O
good O
too O
. O

Dokebi O
gives O
Williamsburg O
the O
right O
one O
- O
two O
punch O
of O
classic O
Korean B-AS
food I-AS
and O
fusion B-AS
twists I-AS
like O
pork B-AS
belly I-AS
tacos I-AS
. O

The O
hot B-AS
dogs I-AS
are O
good O
, O
yes O
, O
but O
the O
reason O
to O
get O
over O
here O
is O
the O
fantastic O
pork B-AS
croquette I-AS
sandwich I-AS
, O
perfect O
on O
its O
supermarket O
squishy O
bun B-AS
. O

Restaurant O
with O
a O
view B-AS

Celebrated O
my O
fathers O
birthday O
here O
. O

The O
food B-AS
tasted O
very O
good O
. O

The O
family B-AS
seafood I-AS
entree I-AS
was O
very O
good O
. O

The O
main B-AS
entree I-AS
was O
also O
very O
good O
. O

We O
order O
a O
bit O
of O
everything O
on O
the O
menu O
. O

Price O
is O
high O
but O
the O
food B-AS
is O
good O
, O
so O
I O
would O
come O
back O
again O
. O

This O
place B-AS
does O
n't O
make O
any O
sense O

Just O
want O
to O
warn O
you O
all O
, O
do O
n't O
waste O
your O
time O
and O
money O
. O

This O
place O
has O
totally O
weird O
decor B-AS
, O
stairs O
going O
up O
with O
mirrored B-AS
walls I-AS
, O
I O
am O
surprised O
how O
no O
one O
yet O
broke O
their O
head O
or O
fall O
off O
the O
stairs O
, O
mirrored B-AS
walls I-AS
make O
you O
dizzy O
and O
delusional O
. O

This O
place B-AS
is O
not O
inviting O
and O
the O
food B-AS
is O
totally O
weird O
. O

The O
concept O
of O
japanese B-AS
tapas I-AS
is O
newly O
created O
and O
clearly O
does O
n't O
work O
. O

The O
food B-AS
they O
serve O
is O
not O
comforting O
, O
not O
appetizing O
and O
uncooked O
. O

Go O
to O
japanese O
sushi O
place O
or O
Spanish O
tapas O
place O
, O
this O
creation O
in O
Williamsburg O
is O
a O
misstake O
. O

Good O
Food B-AS

I O
went O
here O
with O
my O
boyfriend O
for O
our O
anniversary O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
great O
and O
tasty O
, O
but O
the O
sitting B-AS
space I-AS
was O
too O
small O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
like O
being O
cramp O
in O
a O
corner O
. O

Over O
all O
it O
was O
a O
very O
nice O
romantic O
place B-AS
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
to O
ask O
for O
a O
bigger O
sitting O
area O
when O
you O
make O
a O
reservation O
if O
possible O

Loved O
it O

A O
coworker O
and O
I O
tried O
Pacifico B-AS
after O
work O
a O
few O
Fridays O
and O
loved O
it O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
was O
great O
. O

The O
food B-AS
we O
ordered O
was O
excellent O
, O
although O
I O
would O
n't O
say O
the O
margaritas B-AS
were O
anything O
to O
write O
home O
about O
. O

Our O
waitress B-AS
was O
n't O
mean O
, O
but O
not O
especially O
warm O
or O
attentive O
either O
. O

I O
must O
say O
I O
am O
surprised O
by O
the O
bad O
reviews O
of O
the O
restaurant B-AS
earlier O
in O
the O
year O
, O
though O
. O

Maybe O
it O
has O
improved O
since O
then O
? O

Regardless O
, O
we O
'll O
be O
back O
and O
ca O
n't O
wait O
to O
visit O
in O
the O
summer O
to O
take O
advantage O
of O
the O
patio B-AS
. O

Dumbfoundingly O
Poor O

This O
was O
, O
from O
start O
to O
finish O
, O
a O
mind O
- O
bogglingly O
uncomfortable O
experience O
. O

Lexicographers O
take O
note O
, O
a O
new O
and O
fascinating O
definition O
of O
rudeness O
is O
alive O
and O
flourishing O
right O
here O
in O
Brooklyn O
. O

The O
servers B-AS
at O
Flatbush O
Farm O
appear O
to O
have O
perfected O
that O
ghastly O
technique O
of O
making O
you O
feel O
guilty O
and O
ashamed O
for O
deigning O
to O
attract O
their O
attention O
. O

Polite O
acknowledgement O
is O
out O
; O

supercilious O
scorn O
is O
in O
. O

And O
how O
many O
times O
can O
you O
pick O
up O
the O
same O
perfectly O
aligned O
set O
of O
napkins O
, O
inspect O
them O
vapidly O
and O
plonk O
them O
down O
in O
exactly O
the O
same O
place O
instead O
of O
venturing O
a O
glance O
at O
people O
who O
are O
there O
to O
help O
you O
make O
the O
rent O
? O

A O
different O
server B-AS
enhanced O
the O
fun O
, O
dumping O
our O
entrees O
in O
front O
of O
us O
halfway O
through O
our O
appetizer B-AS
which O
was O
delicious O
. O

Overall O
the O
food B-AS
quality O
was O
pretty O
good O
, O
though O
I O
hear O
the O
salmon O
is O
much O
better O
when O
it O
has O
n't O
sat O
cooling O
in O
front O
of O
the O
guest O
. O

The O
place O
has O
a O
nice O
fit B-AS
- I-AS
out I-AS
, O
some O
attractive O
furnishings B-AS
and O
, O
from O
what O
I O
could O
tell O
, O
a O
reasonable O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
I O
was O
given O
the O
food O
menu O
when O
I O
asked O
for O
the O
carte O
des O
vins O

At O
$ O
120 O
for O
two O
people O
, O
however O
, O
this O
in O
no O
way O
represents O
value O
, O
unless O
you O
're O
looking O
to O
pay O
by O
the O
hour O
for O
passive O
- O
aggressive O
torture O
. O

On O
that O
scale O
, O
it O
's O
a O
world O
- O
beater O
. O

How O
is O
this O
palce B-AS
still O
open O
? O

I O
honestly O
do O
n't O
even O
know O
where O
to O
begin O
. O

My O
boyfriend O
and O
I O
are O
avid O
restaurant O
goers O
, O
and O
we O
are O
always O
on O
the O
lookout O
for O
new O
places O
and O
our O
friend O
had O
recommended O
Flatbush O
Farms O
. O

We O
arrived O
and O
were O
seated O
immediately O
, O
which O
made O
us O
both O
happy O
. O

We O
ordered O
our O
appetizers O
, O
I O
ordered O
the O
chicken O
and O
my O
boyfriend O
the O
salmon O
. O

Everything O
was O
going O
good O
until O
we O
got O
our O
meals B-AS
. O

I O
took O
one O
look O
at O
the O
chicken B-AS
and O
I O
was O
appalled O
. O

It O
was O
served O
with O
skin O
, O
over O
a O
bed O
of O
extremely O
undercooked O
spinach B-AS
and O
mashed O
potatoes O
. O

My O
boyfriend O
asked O
me O
if O
I O
wanted O
to O
switch O
and O
eat O
his O
salmon O
instead O
, O
while O
he O
de O
- O
skinned O
the O
chicken O
so O
that O
I O
could O
enjoy O
the O
white O
meat O
. O

I O
took O
one O
bite O
from O
the O
$ O
24 O
salmon B-AS
, O
and O
I O
have O
never O
, O
in O
the O
17 O
years O
I O
have O
been O
going O
to O
restaurants O
tasted O
salmon B-AS
as O
fishy O
, O
as O
dry O
, O
and O
as O
bland O
as O
the O
one O
in O
Flatbush O
Farms O
. O

At O
this O
point O
, O
the O
waitress B-AS
comes O
over O
and O
asks O
us O
if O
everything O
was O
okay O
, O
I O
was O
literally O
so O
shocked O
that O
I O
was O
speechless O
and O
did O
n't O
say O
anything O
, O
and O
guess O
what O
, O
the O
waitress B-AS
WALKED O
away O
. O

So O
, O
I O
switch O
with O
my O
boyfriend O
again O
to O
see O
if O
maybe O
I O
could O
stomach O
the O
meat O
and O
spinach B-AS
again O
, O
but O
the O
spinach B-AS
was O
so O
undercooked O
that O
I O
just O
could O
not O
bite O
through O
it O
. O

I O
could O
n't O
even O
enjoy O
the O
mashed O
potatoes O
because O
it O
was O
hidden O
completely O
under O
the O
chicken O
and O
spinach O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
had O
better O
chicken O
at O
BBQs O
! O
! O
! O
! O

So O
I O
decide O
to O
report O
back O
to O
the O
waitress O
because O
it O
was O
completely O
inedible O
. O

Guess O
what O
, O
I O
waited O
for O
TWENTY O
minutes O
before O
she O
came O
over O
and O
when O
she O
finally O
did O
, O
she O
says O
, O
oh O
well O
, O
I O
wish O
you O
would O
have O
said O
something O
earlier O
No O
apology O
, O
nothing O
. O

After O
that O
she O
simply O
took O
our O
plates O
, O
walked O
away O
, O
came O
back O
another O
TWENTY O
minutes O
later O
with O
the O
bill O
and O
the O
chicken O
on O
it O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O

No O
desert O
menu O
, O
no O
apology O
, O
nothing O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O

I O
was O
literally O
going O
to O
explode O
, O
but O
instead O
, O
my O
boyfriend O
took O
the O
bill O
and O
went O
to O
find O
the O
manager O
. O

This O
is O
where O
it O
really O
really O
gets O
bad O
, O
the O
manager B-AS
said O
, O
there O
is O
absolutely O
nothing O
we O
can O
do O
, O
it O
's O
a O
matter O
of O
taste O
that O
she O
did O
n't O
like O
it O
, O
and O
I O
can O
not O
comp O
it O
. O

Again O
, O
no O
apology O
, O
no O
is O
there O
anything O
else O
I O
can O
get O
you O
, O
no O
can O
I O
get O
you O
a O
drink O
to O
make O
up O
for O
it O
, O
nothing O
! O
! O
! O
! O

We O
refused O
to O
pay O
for O
it O
because O
at O
this O
point O
it O
had O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
the O
food O
anymore O
. O

The O
level O
of O
rudeness O
was O
preposterous O
. O

The O
manager B-AS
came O
to O
the O
table O
and O
said O
we O
can O
do O
what O
we O
want O
, O
so O
we O
paid O
for O
what O
we O
did O
enjoy O
, O
the O
drinks B-AS
and O
appetizers B-AS
, O
and O
walked O
out O
. O

I O
HAVE O
NEVER O
EVER O
HAD O
SUCH O
AN O
UNPLEASANT O
EXPERIENCE O
. O

THIS O
STAFF B-AS
SHOULD O
BE O
FIRED O

Moving O
on O
. O

If O
I O
could O
give O
0 O
stars O
I O
would O
do O
so O
for O
this O
place B-AS
. O

Casa O
La O
Femme O
is O
to O
middle O
eastern O
dining O
what O
Chuckie O
Cheeze O
is O
to O
italian O
. O

The O
reason O
there O
are O
4 O
different O
results O
on O
citysearch O
for O
the O
same O
place O
is O
because O
they O
keep O
trying O
to O
start O
a O
new O
thread O
so O
they O
can O
stock O
it O
with O
positive O
reviews O
. O

Wellthey O
can O
run O
but O
they O
ca O
n't O
hide O
. O

I O
live O
in O
the O
West O
Village O
and O
I O
' O
ve O
been O
to O
a O
lot O
of O
restaurants O
. O

Sometimes O
you O
pay O
a O
lot O
and O
do O
n't O
get O
much O
in O
return O
, O
it O
's O
manhattan O
, O
things O
are O
expensive O
. O

However O
, O
most O
of O
them O
are O
at O
least O
prompt O
and O
pleasant O
. O

This O
place B-AS
where O
do O
i O
begin O
. O

It O
is O
quite O
a O
spectacular O
scene B-AS
i O
'll O
give O
them O
that O
. O

The O
decor B-AS
however O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
distraction O
so O
you O
wo O
n't O
notice O
that O
you O
just O
payed O
300 O
bucks O
for O
some O
cold O
eggplant B-AS
that O
took O
2 O
FRICKIN O
HOURS O
TO O
COME O
! O
! O
! O
! O

How O
this O
place B-AS
survives O
the O
competitive O
west O
village O
market O
in O
this O
economy O
, O
or O
any O
other O
for O
that O
matter O
, O
is O
beyond O
me O
. O

Great O
Hot B-AS
Dogs I-AS
! O

I O
' O
ve O
made O
the O
trip O
out O
here O
a O
few O
times O
with O
a O
friend O
who O
lives O
nearby O
I O
live O
on O
UWS O
. O

Though O
it O
's O
been O
crowded O
most O
times O
I O
' O
ve O
gone O
here O
, O
Bark B-AS
always O
delivers O
on O
their O
food B-AS
. O

The O
hot B-AS
dogs I-AS
are O
top O
notch O
, O
and O
they O
're O
Slamwich B-AS
is O
amazing O
! O

Going O
to O
Bark B-AS
is O
always O
worth O
the O
train O
ride O
, O
and O
will O
make O
your O
tongue O
and O
belly O
very O
happy O
! O

Only O
complaint O
is O
the O
pricing O
-- O
I O
believe O
it O
would O
be O
more O
reasonable O
to O
pay O
a O
dollar O
less O
on O
each O
item O
listed O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
. O

But O
nonetheless O
-- O
great O
spot B-AS
, O
great O
food B-AS
. O

Fabulous O
food B-AS
, O
if O
the O
front B-AS
of I-AS
house I-AS
staff I-AS
do O
n't O
put O
you O
off O

We O
live O
nearby O
BFC O
. O

It O
's O
a O
little O
out O
of O
our O
price O
range O
for O
dining O
there O
except O
on O
special O
occasions O
, O
but O
we O
' O
ve O
eaten O
there O
6 O
times O
in O
the O
last O
2 O
years O
. O

Each O
time O
we O
' O
ve O
been O
, O
the O
front B-AS
of I-AS
house I-AS
staff I-AS
not O
the O
waiters B-AS
, O
they O
're O
fantastic O
, O
but O
the O
people O
who O
greet O
and O
seat O
you O
has O
been O
so O
hideous O
to O
us O
that O
were O
it O
not O
for O
the O
exceptional O
fish B-AS
dishes I-AS
I O
would O
never O
return O
. O

As O
BFC B-AS
does O
n't O
take O
reservations O
you O
almost O
always O
have O
to O
wait O
by O
the O
bar O
, O
and O
be O
abused O
by O
the O
front B-AS
of I-AS
house I-AS
staff I-AS
until O
you O
are O
seated O
, O
which O
can O
be O
over O
an O
hour O
later O
! O

The O
frizzy O
retro O
girl B-AS
with O
winged/ O
Dame O
Edna O
glasses O
will O
yell O
at O
you O
if O
you O
try O
to O
order O
a O
drink O
. O

I O
was O
almost O
amused O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
she O
was O
turning O
away O
customers O
at O
9 O
pm O
on O
a O
Friday O
night O
because O
she O
had O
a O
BBQ O
to O
go O
to O
that O
night O
, O
WTF O
? O
? O

I O
'd O
be O
horrified O
if O
my O
staff B-AS
were O
turning O
away O
customers O
so O
early O
and O
so O
rudely O
! O

There O
's O
another O
girl B-AS
who O
I O
ca O
n't O
describe O
, O
she O
is O
about O
5'6 O
with O
brown O
hair O
, O
who O
eavesdrops O
on O
your O
conversation O
and O
chimes O
in O
, O
except O
she O
only O
hears O
the O
last O
part O
of O
what O
you O
said O
, O
so O
her O
uninvited O
opinions O
are O
often O
out O
of O
context O
and O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
what O
you O
're O
* O
really O
* O
talking O
about O
. O

I O
' O
m O
a O
friendly O
person O
, O
so O
I O
would O
n't O
mind O
had O
she O
not O
been O
so O
nasty O
and O
gotten O
so O
personal O
. O

Again O
, O
I O
'd O
be O
super O
upset O
if O
that O
were O
my O
employee O
. O

Considering O
you O
will O
spend O
at O
least O
$ O
60 O
a O
head O
, O
I O
expect O
better O
service B-AS
. O

So O
, O
if O
you O
're O
walking O
by O
and O
thinking O
about O
dining O
, O
you O
might O
want O
to O
see O
who O
's O
going O
to O
be O
seating O
you O
first O
. O

Maitre B-AS
- I-AS
D I-AS
and O
get O
out O

My O
family O
ate O
here O
last O
weekend O
. O

The O
food B-AS
and O
service B-AS
were O
fine O
, O
however O
the O
maitre B-AS
- I-AS
D I-AS
was O
incredibly O
unwelcoming O
and O
arrogant O
. O

While O
finishing O
our O
meals O
which O
included O
a O
high O
- O
end O
bottle B-AS
of I-AS
wine I-AS
, O
our O
son O
's O
fiance O
joined O
us O
for O
a O
glass O
of O
wine O
and O
dessert O
. O

This O
guy O
refused O
to O
seat O
her O
and O
she O
left O
, O
followed O
shortly O
by O
the O
four O
of O
us O
, O
but O
not O
before O
I O
told O
him O
that O
in O
my O
40 O
years O
of O
world O
travel O
, O
including O
Paris O
, O
that O
I O
had O
never O
seen O
such O
a O
display O
of O
bad O
behavior O
by O
a O
frontman B-AS
in O
a O
restaurant O
. O

His O
response O
was O
smug O
, O
arrogant O
, O
and O
condescending O
, O
totally O
consistent O
with O
his O
deportment O
on O
display O
all O
evening O
. O

A O
word O
to O
the O
wise O
, O
you O
ca O
n't O
dine O
here O
and O
disturb O
the O
maitre B-AS
- I-AS
D I-AS
's O
sense O
of O
table O
turnover O
, O
as O
whacked O
as O
it O
is O
, O
or O
else O
. O

If O
you O
go O
here O
, O
do O
it O
on O
his O
off O
- O
night O
. O

Best O
meal B-AS
in O
a O
long O
time O
! O

Mussles B-AS
and O
calamari B-AS
were O
superb O
Saturday O
evening O
. O

I O
had O
the O
Lamb B-AS
special I-AS
which O
was O
perfect O
. O

My O
father O
had O
the O
flank B-AS
steak I-AS
which O
was O
very O
good O
, O
and O
my O
mother O
had O
the O
swordfish O
. O

The B-AS
Four I-AS
Seasons I-AS
restaurant I-AS
is O
a O
great O
experience O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
great O
and O
the O
environment B-AS
is O
even O
better O
. O

Everyone O
must O
come O
here O
at O
least O
once O
. O

Highly O
recommend O
it O
! O

Taking O
Hot B-AS
Dogs I-AS
to O
the O
next O
level O

At O
first O
glance O
this O
place O
seems O
a O
bit O
pricey O
for O
a O
hot B-AS
dog I-AS
joint O
, O
but O
at O
Bark B-AS
you O
do O
n't O
just O
get O
your O
average O
hot B-AS
dog I-AS
. O

Here O
the O
hot B-AS
dog I-AS
is O
elevated O
to O
the O
level O
of O
a O
real O
entree O
with O
numerous O
variations O
available O
. O

Great O
Atmosphere B-AS

Went O
to O
this O
place O
this O
place O
on O
a O
real O
cold O
night O
and O
needed O
a O
quick O
meal O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
the O
fish B-AS
tacos I-AS
, O
everything O
else O
was O
ok O
. O

Cool O
atmosphere B-AS
, O
the O
fire B-AS
place I-AS
in O
the O
back O
really O
ads O
to O
it O
but O
needs O
a O
bit O
more O
heat O
throughout O
on O
a O
cold O
night O
. O

Poor O
service B-AS
and O
management B-AS

Do O
n't O
go O
to O
this O
place B-AS
! O

Had O
an O
awful O
experience O
at O
Casa B-AS
la I-AS
Femme I-AS
on O
a O
Saturday O
dinner O
. O

Appetizers O
took O
nearly O
an O
hour O
. O

When O
the O
main O
course O
finally O
arrived O
another O
45mins O
half O
of O
our O
order O
was O
missing O
. O

Never O
got O
an O
explanation O
as O
to O
what O
was O
going O
on O
. O

The O
manager B-AS
was O
rude O
and O
handled O
the O
situation O
extremely O
poorly O
. O

When O
we O
threatened O
to O
leave O
, O
we O
were O
offered O
a O
meager O
discount O
even O
though O
half O
the O
order O
was O
missing O
. O

On O
the O
way O
out O
, O
we O
heard O
of O
other O
guests O
complaining O
about O
similar O
issues O
. O

Ca O
n't O
believe O
how O
an O
expensive O
NYC O
restaurant B-AS
can O
be O
so O
disrespectful O
to O
its O
clients O
. O

What O
a O
hassle O
! O

The O
food B-AS
is O
very O
good O
, O
but O
not O
outstanding O
. O

There O
is O
no O
way O
it O
justifies O
the O
accolades O
it O
receives O
, O
the O
attitude O
of O
the O
staff B-AS
or O
the O
wait B-AS
for O
a O
table O
. O

On O
our O
last O
visit O
, O
they O
skipped O
over O
our O
name O
on O
the O
list O
, O
leaving O
us O
waiting O
an O
extra O
hour O
for O
a O
table O
. O

Mistakes O
happen O
, O
but O
they O
are O
usually O
accompanied O
by O
an O
apology O
, O
perhaps O
even O
a O
glass O
of O
winebut O
not O
the O
grunt O
that O
we O
received O
from O
the O
Al O
Di O
La O
staff B-AS
. O

Without O
the O
wait O
or O
attitude O
, O
I O
would O
probably O
go O
back O
, O
but O
there O
are O
just O
too O
many O
other O
restaurants O
in O
Brooklyn O
that O
are O
as O
good O
or O
better O
and O
do O
n't O
make O
me O
jump O
through O
hoops O
. O

Expensive O

I O
went O
there O
after O
hearing O
how O
great O
it O
was O
. O

Wow O
. O

The O
bread B-AS
was O
stale O
, O
the O
salad B-AS
was O
overpriced O
and O
empty O
. O

The O
pasta B-AS
was O
well O
cooked O
, O
did O
n't O
have O
enough O
sauce O
though O
or O
flavor O
. O

I O
though O
it O
was O
expensive O
and O
I O
prefer O
Bella O
Via O
just O
blocks O
away O
by O
far O
. O

So O
rude O
! O
! O
! O

I O
went O
with O
JWILS O
. O

Her O
review O
is O
above O
. O

I O
was O
one O
of O
the O
people O
that O
went O
for O
this O
horrible O
experience O
. O

My O
friend O
is O
100 O
% O
right O
in O
the O
experience O
we O
had O
. O

The O
hostess B-AS
was O
rude O
and O
I O
got O
a O
distinct O
feeling O
that O
they O
did O
not O
want O
to O
serve O
us O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
my O
friend O
left O
out O
is O
that O
when O
we O
sat O
down O
at O
the O
bar O
the O
bartender B-AS
disappeared O
. O

I O
asked O
for O
a O
menu O
and O
the O
same O
waitress B-AS
looked O
at O
my O
like O
I O
was O
insane O
. O

I O
was O
shocked O
that O
my O
friends O
wanted O
to O
stay O
after O
the O
waitress B-AS
said O
, O
can O
I O
help O
you O
and O
how O
many O
are O
in O
your O
party O
. O

What O
? O

The O
three O
of O
us O
standing O
in O
front O
of O
her O
should O
have O
been O
an O
indication O
of O
how O
many O
of O
us O
there O
were O
. O

We O
did O
n't O
look O
like O
the O
other O
patrons O
in O
there O
so O
unfortunately O
I O
think O
that O
may O
have O
been O
part O
of O
the O
problem O
. O

Shame O
on O
this O
place O
for O
the O
horrible O
rude O
staff B-AS
and O
non O
- O
existent O
customer B-AS
service I-AS
. O

bad O
staff B-AS

I O
generally O
like O
this O
place B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
good O
. O

The O
design O
of O
the O
space B-AS
is O
good O
. O

But O
the O
service B-AS
is O
HORRID O
! O

I O
was O
there O
for O
brunch O
recently O
, O
and O
we O
were O
tag O
teamed O
by O
a O
waitress B-AS
and O
a O
waiter B-AS
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
delivered O
our O
food O
while O
holding O
what O
appeared O
to O
be O
a O
plastic O
bag O
of O
garbage O
in O
one O
hand O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
believe O
that O
it O
was O
, O
but O
please O
put O
the O
bag O
down O
before O
delivering O
food O
! O

The O
waitress B-AS
came O
to O
check O
in O
on O
us O
every O
few O
minutes O
, O
and O
began O
to O
clear O
the O
plates O
while O
half O
of O
us O
were O
still O
eating O
a O
big O
pet O
peeve O
of O
mine O
that O
happens O
almost O
everywhere O
, O
so O
I O
try O
to O
ignore O
it O
. O

I O
could O
n't O
ignore O
the O
fact O
that O
she O
reach O
over O
the O
plate O
of O
one O
of O
my O
friends O
, O
who O
was O
in O
mid O
bite O
, O
to O
clear O
the O
table O
. O

She O
then O
put O
the O
check O
down O
without O
asking O
if O
we O
were O
done O
, O
and O
came O
to O
check O
on O
the O
bill O
every O
two O
minutes O
, O
even O
though O
we O
were O
one O
of O
three O
occupied O
tables O
. O

I O
wish O
I O
could O
like O
this O
place B-AS
more O
, O
and O
I O
wish O
someone O
would O
retrain O
the O
staff B-AS
. O

Yum O
! O

Serves O
really O
good O
sushi B-AS
. O

Not O
the O
biggest O
portions B-AS
but O
adequate O
. O

Green B-AS
Tea I-AS
creme I-AS
brulee I-AS
is O
a O
must O
! O

Do O
n't O
leave O
the O
restaurant O
without O
it O
. O

No O
Comparison O

I O
ca O
n't O
say O
enough O
about O
this O
place B-AS
. O

It O
has O
great O
sushi B-AS
and O
even O
better O
service B-AS
. O

The O
entire O
staff B-AS
was O
extremely O
accomodating O
and O
tended O
to O
my O
every O
need O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
been O
to O
this O
restaurant B-AS
over O
a O
dozen O
times O
with O
no O
complaints O
to O
date O
. O

Snotty O
Attitude O

We O
were O
treated O
very O
rudely O
here O
one O
time O
for O
breakfast O
. O

The O
owner B-AS
is O
belligerent O
to O
guests O
that O
have O
a O
complaint O
. O

Good O
food B-AS
! O

We O
love O
breakfast O
food O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
place O
to O
get O
a O
delicious O
meal B-AS
. O

We O
never O
had O
to O
wait O
more O
than O
5 O
minutes O
. O

The O
staff B-AS
is O
pretty O
friendly O
. O

The O
onion B-AS
rings I-AS
are O
great O
! O

They O
are O
not O
greasy O
or O
anything O
. O

Overrated O

I O
was O
highly O
disappointed O
in O
the O
food B-AS
at O
Pagoda O
. O

The O
lemon B-AS
chicken I-AS
tasted O
like O
sticky O
sweet O
donuts O
and O
the O
honey B-AS
walnut I-AS
prawns I-AS
, O
the O
few O
they O
actually O
give O
youwere O
not O
good O
. O

The O
prices O
are O
outrageous O
, O
especially O
since O
the O
food O
was O
actually O
less O
satisfying O
than O
most O
neighborhood O
Chinese O
establishments O
. O

Nice O
ambience B-AS
, O
but O
highly O
overrated O
place B-AS
. O

I O
will O
not O
go O
back O
. O

Worst O
Service B-AS
I O
Ever O
Had O

A O
group O
of O
5 O
of O
us O
went O
there O
for O
Sunday O
brunch O
and O
sat O
outside O
. O

Everyone O
that O
sat O
in O
the O
back O
outside O
agreed O
that O
it O
was O
the O
worst O
service B-AS
we O
had O
ever O
received O
. O

Our O
waiter B-AS
was O
non O
- O
existent O
and O
after O
our O
food O
finally O
arrived O
over O
an O
hour O
after O
we O
ordered O
, O
we O
were O
not O
given O
any O
water O
or O
utensils O
. O

I O
complained O
to O
the O
manager B-AS
, O
but O
he O
was O
not O
even O
apologetic O
. O

I O
will O
never O
return O
again O
. O

Fabulous O
Italian B-AS
Food I-AS
! O

I O
highly O
recommend O
Mioposto B-AS
. O

I O
am O
so O
happy O
to O
have O
a O
wonderful O
Italian B-AS
restaurant I-AS
in O
my O
neighborhood O
. O

The O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
is O
wonderful O
and O
the O
food B-AS
reminds O
me O
of O
my O
recent O
trip O
to O
Italy O
. O

I O
love O
this O
restaurant B-AS

I O
will O
never O
forget O
the O
amazing O
meal B-AS
, O
service B-AS
, O
and O
ambiance B-AS
I O
experience O
at O
this O
restaurant O
. O

It O
was O
absolutely O
amazing O
. O

The O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
is O
incredible O
and O
extensive O
and O
diverse O
, O
the O
food B-AS
is O
all O
incredible O
and O
the O
staff B-AS
was O
all O
very O
nice O
, O
good O
at O
their O
jobs O
and O
cultured O
. O

I O
have O
not O
a O
bad O
thing O
to O
say O
about O
this O
place B-AS
. O

AMAZING O
. O

I O
can O
not O
wait O
to O
go O
back O
again O
this O
coming O
weekend O
! O

Mmm O
good O
! O
. O

Went O
there O
last O
night O
with O
a O
friend O
. O

She O
had O
heard O
from O
a O
co O
- O
worker O
about O
this O
place O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
great O
! O

It O
's O
* O
very O
* O
reasonably O
priced O
, O
esp O
for O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
food B-AS
. O

I O
had O
the O
Kafta B-AS
plate I-AS
and O
it O
was O
perfect O
. O

We O
're O
going O
back O
, O
D O
. O

Finally O
a O
meal B-AS
that O
you O
will O
remember O
for O
a O
long O
time O
! O

In O
a O
age O
of O
incremental O
cost O
cutting O
in O
restaurants O
, O
its O
nice O
to O
see O
a O
place O
that O
bucks O
that O
trend O
, O
and O
just O
plain O
delivers O
high O
quality O
food B-AS
and O
good O
service B-AS
, O
period O
. O

This O
is O
the O
place B-AS
to O
relax O
and O
enjoy O
the O
finest O
quality O
food B-AS
the O
industry O
can O
offer O
. O

Caution O
, O
its O
real O
food B-AS
for O
people O
who O
love O
the O
best O
. O

Some O
of O
the O
food O
is O
clearly O
oriented O
toward O
foodies O
like O
me O
so O
if O
your O
not O
a O
foodie O
nothing O
wrong O
with O
that O
head O
over O
to O
McDonalds O
or O
some O
Ruby O
Tuesday O
and O
have O
at O
it O
! O

If O
your O
looking O
for O
real O
quality O
not O
the O
BS O
that O
is O
seen O
on O
yelp O
ratings O
, O
which O
allegedly O
recently O
got O
in O
trouble O
for O
adjusting O
ratings O
, O
you O
need O
to O
get O
in O
here O
! O

Very O
Disappointing O

I O
took O
my O
parents O
here O
for O
their O
anniversary O
- O
very O
very O
disappointed O
! O
! O
! O

I O
liked O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
very O
much O
but O
the O
food B-AS
was O
not O
worth O
the O
price O
. O

I O
may O
not O
be O
a O
sushi O
guru O
but O
I O
can O
tell O
you O
that O
the O
food B-AS
here O
is O
just O
okay O
and O
that O
there O
is O
not O
much O
else O
to O
it O
. O

Rice B-AS
is O
too O
dry O
, O
tuna B-AS
was O
n't O
so O
fresh O
either O
. O

Nothing O
really O
came O
across O
as O
outstanding O
. O

Very O
disappointed O
. O

I O
have O
eaten O
here O
three O
times O
and O
have O
found O
the O
quality O
and O
variety O
of O
the O
fish B-AS
to O
be O
excellent O
. O

However O
, O
the O
value O
and O
service B-AS
are O
both O
severely O
lacking O
. O

Portions O
contain O
less O
fish O
than O
one O
would O
expect O
, O
particularly O
since O
prices O
are O
in O
line O
with O
the O
best O
sushi O
places O
in O
NYC O
Masa O
excluded O
, O
of O
course O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
while O
the O
fish B-AS
is O
unquestionably O
fresh O
, O
rolls B-AS
tend O
to O
be O
inexplicably O
bland O
. O

The O
service B-AS
ranges O
from O
mediocre O
to O
offensive O
. O

On O
a O
recent O
trip O
, O
our O
waiter B-AS
was O
extremely O
dismissive O
, O
while O
no O
less O
than O
three O
staff B-AS
members I-AS
waited O
hand O
- O
and O
- O
foot O
on O
a O
pair O
of O
Japanese O
girls O
seated O
nearby O
. O

We O
were O
then O
charged O
for O
their O
most O
expensive O
sake O
$ O
20 O
+ O
per O
serving O
when O
we O
in O
fact O
drank O
a O
sake O
of O
less O
than O
half O
that O
price O
. O

But O
I O
m O
sure O
this O
was O
just O
an O
honest O
mistake O
. O

Freshest O
sushi B-AS
, O
I O
love O
this O
restaurant B-AS
. O

They O
pay O
such O
detail O
to O
everything O
from O
miso B-AS
soup I-AS
to O
complex O
rolls B-AS
. O

The O
sashimi B-AS
was O
the O
freshest O
and O
most O
tender O
I O
have O
ever O
tasted O
. O

Their O
apps B-AS
are O
all O
delicious O
. O

The O
only O
drawback O
is O
that O
this O
place B-AS
is O
really O
expensive O
and O
the O
portions B-AS
are O
on O
the O
small O
side O
. O

But O
the O
space B-AS
is O
small O
and O
lovely O
, O
and O
the O
service B-AS
is O
helpful O
. O

You O
are O
bound O
to O
have O
a O
very O
charming O
time O
. O

Not O
recommanded O
! O
! O
! O

The O
food B-AS
was O
not O
great O
& O
the O
waiters B-AS
were O
rude O
. O

It O
is O
not O
worth O
going O
at O
all O
and O
spend O
your O
money O
there O
! O
! O
! O

great O
service B-AS

Pretty O
cheap O
for O
sit O
down O
Mexican O
AND O
downtown O
. O

my O
service B-AS
was O
stellar O
! O

the O
bus B-AS
boy I-AS
even O
spotted O
that O
my O
table O
was O
shaking O
a O
stabilized O
it O
for O
me O
. O

food B-AS
was O
fine O
, O
with O
a O
some O
little O
- O
tastier O
- O
than O
- O
normal O
salsa B-AS
. O

If O
you O
're O
in O
the O
area O
you O
should O
n't O
be O
disappointed O
. O

Ok O
, O
Maybe O
I O
went O
in O
on O
someone O
's O
bad O
day O
. O

the O
food B-AS
was O
great O
, O
the O
margaritas B-AS
too O
but O
the O
waitress B-AS
was O
too O
busy O
being O
nice O
to O
her O
other O
larger O
party O
than O
to O
take O
better O
care O
of O
my O
friend O
and O
me O
. O

Took O
forever O
to O
get O
our O
order O
taken O
, O
water O
refills O
were O
too O
much O
to O
ask O
for O
and O
the O
only O
time O
she O
was O
fast O
was O
when O
we O
asked O
for O
our O
bill O
when O
we O
could O
get O
her O
attention O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
I O
'll O
be O
back O
. O

Mama O
Mia O
, O
I O
live O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
and O
feel O
lucky O
to O
live O
by O
such O
a O
great O
pizza B-AS
place I-AS
. O

the O
only O
problem O
is O
you O
really O
have O
to O
warm O
up O
the O
pizza B-AS
before O
it O
's O
edible O
, O
even O
when O
you O
order O
ahead O
. O

BUt O
once O
done O
, O
it O
's O
not O
too O
much O
dough O
, O
not O
too O
much O
cheese O
, O
not O
too O
much O
sauce O
. O

Thank O

Go O
Beyond O
the O
California O
Rolls O
. O

The O
sushi B-AS
here O
is O
delicious O
! O

They O
have O
a O
wide O
variety O
of O
fish B-AS
and O
they O
even O
list O
which O
oceans O
they O
come O
from O
; O
Atlantic O
or O
Pacific O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
had O
the O
Jellyfish B-AS
, O
Horse B-AS
Mackerel I-AS
, O
Blue B-AS
Fin I-AS
Tuna I-AS
and O
the O
Sake B-AS
Ikura I-AS
roll I-AS
among O
others O
, O
and O
they O
were O
all O
good O
. O

My O
only O
negative O
comment O
is O
that O
I O
wish O
the O
pieces B-AS
were O
a O
little O
bigger O
. O

The O
decor B-AS
is O
rustic O
, O
traditional O
Japanese O
. O

The O
crowd B-AS
is O
mixed O
yuppies O
, O
young O
and O
old O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
courteous O
and O
attentive O
. O

Mediocre O
food B-AS

We O
ate O
on O
the O
outside O
patio O
area O
for O
dinner O
on O
a O
Saturday O
night O
. O

The O
outside O
patio O
area O
has O
an O
abbreviated O
menu B-AS
. O

We O
ordered O
the O
marinated O
grapes O
, O
buffalo O
style O
chicken O
wings O
, O
and O
the O
turkey O
sandwich O
. O

My O
g O
/ O
f O
and O
I O
both O
agreed O
the O
food B-AS
was O
very O
mediocre O
especially O
considering O
the O
price O
. O

We O
are O
locals O
, O
and O
get O
the O
feeling O
the O
only O
way O
this O
place B-AS
survives O
with O
such O
average O
food B-AS
is O
because O
most O
customers O
are O
probably O
one O
- O
time O
customer O
tourists O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
decent O
. O

Drinks B-AS
were O
good O
. O

Unless O
you O
are O
just O
stopping O
in O
for O
a O
few O
drinks B-AS
I O
would O
n't O
recommend O
going O
here O
. O

You O
are O
likely O
to O
be O
disappointed O
. O

Excellent O
food B-AS
, O
nice O
ambience B-AS
, O
fairly O
expensive O

I O
loved O
the O
pumpkin B-AS
ravioli I-AS
and O
the O
goat B-AS
cheese I-AS
gnocchi I-AS
5 O
big O
ones O
to O
a O
plate O
instead O
of O
20 O
or O
so O
little O
gnocchis O
and O
my O
sister O
loved O
her O
filet B-AS
mignon I-AS
on I-AS
top I-AS
of I-AS
spinach I-AS
and I-AS
mashed I-AS
potatoes I-AS
. O

The O
ambiance B-AS
was O
a O
peaceful O
and O
relaxing O
break O
amongst O
all O
the O
kids O
running O
around O
in O
Downtown O
Disney O
. O

It O
was O
romantic O
, O
and O
even O
nice O
even O
with O
my O
sister O
, O
reminded O
me O
of O
Italy O
, O
and O
had O
artwork B-AS
and O
music B-AS
that O
kept O
up O
the O
feeling O
of O
being O
in O
a O
Mediterrean O
villa O
. O

I O
recommend O
it O
for O
a O
night O
when O
you O
want O
to O
splurge O
! O
it O
was O
a O
bit O
expensive O

Best O
Indian B-AS
food I-AS
in O
LA O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
been O
to O
over O
a O
dozen O
Indian O
places O
in O
LA O
, O
and O
this O
is O
still O
my O
favorite O
. O

The O
best O
thing O
is O
, O
the O
prices O
are O
also O
quite O
reasonable O
. O

The O
chicken B-AS
curry I-AS
and O
chicken B-AS
tikka I-AS
masala I-AS
are O
my O
favorite O
meat O
dishes O
. O

The O
chana B-AS
masala I-AS
( I-AS
garbanzo I-AS
beans I-AS
) I-AS
are O
also O
excellent O
. O

It O
's O
located O
in O
a O
strip O
mall O
near O
the O
Beverly O
Center O
, O
not O
the O
greatest O
location B-AS
, O
but O
the O
food B-AS
keeps O
me O
coming O
back O
for O
more O
. O

hidden O
little O
jem O

tucked O
away O
over O
by O
the O
Beverly O
Center O
. O

Never O
too O
crowded O
and O
always O
great O
service B-AS
. O

I O
think O
I O
have O
probably O
tried O
each O
item O
on O
their O
menu B-AS
at O
least O
once O
it O
is O
all O
excellent O
. O

I O
can O
highly O
recommend O
their O
various O
saag B-AS
and O
paneer B-AS
and O
korma B-AS
. O

You O
routinely O
see O
Indian O
families O
and O
friends O
dining O
there O
, O
which O
is O
always O
a O
good O
sign O
. O

I O
appreciate O
their O
delivery B-AS
too O
. O

Nice O
food B-AS
but O
no O
spice O
! O

I O
really O
enjoyed O
my O
meal B-AS
here O
. O

I O
had O
yummy O
lamb B-AS
korma I-AS
, O
saag B-AS
paneer I-AS
, O
samosas B-AS
, O
naan B-AS
, O
etc O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
all O
good O
but O
it O
was O
way O
too O
mild O
. O

Normally O
, O
places O
ask O
how O
hot O
you O
want O
it O
, O
but O
they O
did O
n't O
. O

I O
should O
have O
thought O
to O
bring O
it O
up O
but O
never O
expected O
the O
food B-AS
to O
be O
that O
mild O
. O

I O
will O
give O
them O
another O
chance O
and O
make O
sure O
to O
tell O
them O
to O
kick O
it O
up O
several O
notches O
. O

The O
naan B-AS
was O
some O
of O
the O
best O
I O
' O
ve O
had O
and O
I O
really O
enjoyed O
the O
bhartha B-AS
, O
not O
too O
tomatoey O
. O

Even O
the O
chickpeas B-AS
, O
which O
I O
normally O
find O
too O
dry O
, O
were O
good O
. O

And O
they O
packaged O
everything O
nicely O
so O
it O
did O
n't O
spill O
. O

awesome O
find O

I O
do O
n't O
understand O
how O
I O
was O
a O
stranger O
to O
this O
place B-AS
for O
so O
long O
the O
fajita B-AS
salad I-AS
, O
the O
colorado B-AS
, O
the O
fajitas B-AS
, O
EVERYTHING O
is O
delicious O
. O

I O
love O
the O
warm O
& O
cosy O
environment B-AS
. O

I O
just O
found O
out O
that O
you O
can O
have O
the O
place B-AS
to O
yourself O
on O
nights O
and O
weekends O
for O
a O
private O
party O
, O
ca O
n't O
wait O
to O
celebrate O
my O
next O

I O
' O
ve O
been O
to O
Open B-AS
Sesame I-AS
only O
once O
, O
but O
I O
' O
m O
still O
reeling O
from O
the O
experience O
! O
! O

The O
food B-AS
is O
simply O
unforgettable O
! O

I O
had O
the O
beef O
kabobs O
with O
a O
side O
of O
cucumber O
yogurt O
. O

The O
presentation O
of O
the O
food B-AS
was O
an O
added O
bonus O
, O
it O
looked O
just O
as O
great O
as O
it O
tasted O
! O

My O
best O
friend O
had O
the O
chicken B-AS
shawarma I-AS
and O
she O
STILL O
raves O
about O
it O
being O
the O
best O
anywhere O
! O

Her O
sister O
had O
the O
baklava O
for O
dessert O
! O

What O
a O
tastly O
, O
flaky O
treat O
! O

The O
staff B-AS
are O
friendly O
and O
the O
decor B-AS
was O
ethic O
and O
colorful O
. O

GO O
TO O
OPEN B-AS
SESAME I-AS
! O
! O
! O

Holy O
Hummus B-AS
! O

The O
food B-AS
is O
here O
is O
incredible O
, O
though O
the O
quality O
is O
inconsistent O
during O
lunch B-AS
. O

Dinners B-AS
have O
always O
been O
excellent O
, O
in O
terms O
of O
food O
quality O
. O

The O
open B-AS
sesame I-AS
combo I-AS
plate I-AS
is O
a O
bargain O
for O
the O
heap O
of O
food O
given O
. O

The O
side B-AS
of I-AS
potatoes I-AS
is O
to O
die O
for O
, O
as O
is O
the O
labne B-AS
( I-AS
yogurt I-AS
dip I-AS
) I-AS
. O

Also O
, O
they O
serve O
THE O
best O
hummus B-AS
in O
America O
, O
with O
a O
drizzle O
of O
fragrant O
olive O
oil O
which O
, O
I O
believe O
is O
the O
traditional O
way O
! O

The O
only O
drawback O
is O
the O
crowded O
seating B-AS
and O
the O
slow O
service B-AS
. O

There O
have O
been O
several O
occasions O
when O
we O
' O
ve O
just O
not O
gotten O
some O
side O
dishes O
we O
' O
ve O
ordered O
. O

However O
, O
this O
place B-AS
is O
a O
gem O
, O
and O
I O
wo O
n't O
stop O
going O
back O
. O

great O
beer B-AS

My O
first O
time O
to O
dine O
at O
this O
restaurant B-AS
was O
with O
my O
son O
and O
it O
was O
absolutely O
horrible O
! O

We O
waited O
over O
30 O
minutes O
for O
our O
drinks O
and O
over O
1 O
1/2 O
hours O
for O
our O
food O
. O

I O
swore O
never O
to O
return O
for O
a O
warm O
beer B-AS
and O
mediocre O
meal B-AS
. O

HOWEVER O
, O
one O
Sunday O
afternoon O
my O
husband O
and O
I O
did O
go O
although O
with O
my O
loud O
protests O
and O
were O
pleasantly O
surprised O
. O

The O
band B-AS
was O
very O
good O
and O
the O
service B-AS
was O
attentive O
. O

Outside O
in O
the O
area O
between O
the O
restaurant O
and O
the O
park O
, O
children O
were O
running O
around O
while O
their O
parents O
sipped O
wine O
. O

We O
ordered O
a O
selection O
of O
the O
small O
plates O
, O
and O
the O
shoe B-AS
string I-AS
onions I-AS
, O
goat B-AS
cheese I-AS
pizza I-AS
, O
grilled B-AS
asparagus I-AS
and O
fried B-AS
brie I-AS
with I-AS
fruit I-AS
were O
all O
very O
good O
. O

It O
was O
like O
dining O
at O
a O
completely O
different O
restaurant O
. O

We O
have O
since O
returned O
and O
also O
had O
a O
great O
experience O
, O
sampling O
more O
small O
plates O
and O
a O
variety O
of O
the O
beer B-AS
cold O
and O
good O
. O

We O
did O
have O
the O
same O
waiter B-AS
the O
second O
time O
, O
so O
maybe O
the O
service O
is O
spotty O
and O
our O
luck O
is O
good O
. O

Sunday O
afternoons O
there O
is O
a O
band B-AS
playing O
and O
it O
is O
lots O
of O
fun O
. O

I O

NOT O
THE O
PLACE B-AS
IT O
ONCE O
WAS O

It O
is O
sad O
to O
see O
a O
place B-AS
that O
was O
once O
THE O
place B-AS
to O
meet O
and O
eat O
for O
Bfast O
or O
Lunch O
, O
now O
be O
the O
place B-AS
that O
is O
a O
big O
DONT O
BOTHER O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
not O
what O
it O
once O
was O
potions B-AS
have O
seriously O
seen O
downsizing O
prices O
have O
gone O
up O
, O
and O
the O
service B-AS
is O
the O
worst O
I O
have O
experienced O
anywhere O
including O
mainland O
Europe O
. O

What O
may O
be O
interesting O
to O
most O
is O
the O
worst O
sevice O
/ O
attitude O
comes O
from O
the O
owners B-AS
of O
this O
establishment O
. O

This O
establishment B-AS
really O
made O
a O
marked O
decline O
after O
and O
this O
is O
recurring O
story O
the O
airing O
of O
FOOD O
TELEVISIONS O
DINERS O
, O
DRIVE O
- O
INS O
, O
AND O
DIVES O
hosted O
by O
Guy O
Fieri O
, O
in O
which O
Schooner O
or O
Later O
was O
subject O
of O
. O

Perhaps O
now O
, O
Scooner B-AS
or I-AS
Later I-AS
falls O
into O
the O
Dive O
category O
. O

This O
is O
sad O
for O
what O
once O
was O
one O
of O
the O
best O
places O
you O
could O
ever O
eat O
. O

I O
hope O
one O
day O
Scooner B-AS
or I-AS
Later I-AS
returns O
to O
what O
it O
once O
was O
. O

Untill O
this O
happens O
, O
my O
advice O
is O
to O
STAY O
AWAY O
. O

those O
great O
little O

It O

a O

the O
food B-AS

First O
of O
all O
, O
I O
am O
not O
from O
Long O
Beach O
. O

I O
was O
visiting O
SoCal O
a O
couple O
of O
months O
ago O
when O
the O
friend O
I O
was O
visiting O
decided O
to O
take O
me O
to O
this O
restaurant O
. O

She O
was O
actually O
going O
to O
take O
me O
to O
another O
mediterranean O
restaurant O
right O
across O
the O
street O
but O
they O
were O
not O
open O
yet O
even O
though O
it O
was O
a O
few O
minutes O
past O
their O
opening O
time O
. O

I O
liked O
it O
. O

Food B-AS
was O
good O
and O
cheap O
. O

I O
had O
the O
kafta B-AS
plate I-AS
and O
I O
enjoyed O
it O
. O

It O
was O
so O
much O
though O
that O
I O
could O
barely O
finish O
but O
I O
did O
, O
since O
it O
was O
delicious O
. O

Atmosphere B-AS
was O
nice O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
kind O
of O
slow O
, O
our O
waitress B-AS
took O
forever O
to O
give O
us O
our O
check O
even O
though O
it O
was O
n't O
that O
busy O
. O

Still O
I O
would O
recommend O
this O
place B-AS
. O

BTW O
, O
I O
really O
like O
Long O
Beach O
. O

It O
was O
one O
of O
the O
few O
places O
in O
SoCal O
where O
you O
would O
actually O
walk O
around O
and O
not O
have O
to O
take O
a O
car O
. O

The O
cooks B-AS
have O
been O
at O
the O
restaurant O
for O
years O
and O
cook O
family O
recipes O
. O

Can O
get O
busy O
on O
Fridays O
for O
a O
table O
but O
once O
seated O
, O
the O
service B-AS
is O
so O
efficient O
you O
can O
be O
in O
and O
out O
of O
there O
quickly O
. O

I O
went O
there O
with O
a O
friend O
from O
out O
of O
town O
and O
we O
were O
both O
very O
impressed O
! O
. O

Went O
on O
a O
Monday O
night O
, O
so O
there O
was O
no O
wait O
for O
a O
table O
. O

The O
sushi B-AS
was O
excellent O
and O
the O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
was O
quick O
. O

The O
price O
was O
right O
too O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
was O
just O
okay O
. O

Space B-AS
was O
limited O
, O
but O
the O
food B-AS
made O
up O
for O
it O
. O

I O
'd O
go O
back O
there O
in O
a O
heartbeat O
. O

Should O
have O
gone O
to O
Trader O
Joe O
's O
and O
had O
frozen O
pizza O
, O

My O
family O
went O
on O
a O
midweek O
evening O
to O
have O
dinner O
. O

The O
restaurant O
was O
80 O
% O
full O
and O
there O
was O
a O
sign O
posted O
wait O
to O
be O
seated O
. O

Well O
I O
guess O
it O
's O
hard O
to O
be O
seated O
when O
one O
is O
invisible O
to O
the O
staff B-AS
. O

We O
stood O
there O
for O
10 O
minutes O
while O
employees B-AS
walked O
back O
and O
forth O
ignoring O
us O
. O

Finally O
, O
my O
wife O
stood O
face O
to O
face O
in O
front O
of O
one O
of O
the O
staff B-AS
and O
she O
asked O
, O
Are O
you O
waiting O
for O
a O
table O
? O

Once O
seated O
it O
took O
about O
30 O
minutes O
to O
finally O
get O
the O
meal O
. O

The O
prior O
reviews O
said O
Kid O
friendly O
give O
me O
a O
break O
with O
two O
young O
children O
that O
is O
light O
years O
. O

The O
Caesar B-AS
salad I-AS
I O
ordered O
had O
so O
much O
lemon O
I O
could O
n't O
eat O
it O
. O

The O
pizza O
was O
slightly O
reminescent O
of O
Baker O
's O
Beach O
pizza O
which O
occupied O
the O
the O
space O
years O
ago O
a O
distant O
second O
. O

It O
was O
decent O
but O
nothing O
exceptional O
. O

This O
establishment O
is O
consistent O
with O
my O
feelings O
of O
the O
rest O
of O
Chow O
Foods O
group O
. O

We O
used O
to O
frequent O
most O
of O
their O
restaurants O
but O
over O
the O
years O
each O
one O
has O
really O
been O
disapointing O
. O

I O
' O
m O
a O
born O
and O
bred O
Southend O
resident O
and O
was O
excited O
to O
hear O
of O
this O
restaurant O
opening O
. O

Well O
, O
I O
guess O
maybe O
it O
might O
be O
beneficial O
for O
the O
management O
to O
pay O
a O
visit O
to O
Tutta O
Bella O
in O
Columbia O
City O
for O
some O
tips O
. O

if O
you O
do O

The O

& O
nice O

Good O
for O

last O

without O

Try O
the O
Chef B-AS
's I-AS
Choice I-AS
for I-AS
sushi I-AS
as O
the O
smoked B-AS
yellowtail I-AS
was O
incredible O
and O
the O

were O
also O
tasty O
. O

Poor O

service I-AS
pizza I-AS
. O

As O
with O
most O
restaurants O
in O
Seattle O
, O
Mioposto O
's O
service B-AS
was O
bad O
and O
the O
food B-AS
was O
overpriced O
. O

I O
know O
many O
people O
have O
their O
favorite O
types O
of O
pizza B-AS
and O
pizza B-AS
places O
, O
but O
Mioposto O
's O
pizza B-AS
lacks O
quality O
and O
good O
taste O
. O

To O
be O
honest O
, O
I O
' O
ve O
had O
better O
frozen O
pizza B-AS
. O

I O
' O
m O
not O
kidding O
. O

The O
only O
positive O
thing O
about O
Mioposto B-AS
is O
the O
nice O
location B-AS
. O

Love O
it O
every O
time O

I O
was O
frankly O
shocked O
when O
I O
read O
the O
bad O
reviews O
, O
this O
place B-AS
is O
fantastic O
; O
it O
has O
not O
let O
us O
down O
in O
any O
way O
, O
and O
we O
' O
ve O
eaten O
here O
more O
than O
10 O
times O
. O

People O
complain O
about O
the O
dim O
lighting O
, O
but O
that O
is O
one O
what O
I O
love O
about O
this O
place O
, O
if O
you O
want O
to O
stare O
at O
your O
food O
in O
bright O
light O
, O
go O
to O
McDonalds O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
fantastic O
, O
and O
the O
waiting B-AS
staff I-AS
has O
been O
perfect O
every O
single O
time O
we O
' O
ve O
been O
there O
. O

The O
only O
problem O
would O
be O
the O
wait B-AS
, O
but O
we O
usually O
just O
have O
a O
drink O
in O
the O
front O
while O
wait B-AS
. O

Never O
had O
one O
single O
problem O
there O
. O

Seafood B-AS

This O

COMPLETELY O
OVER O
RATED O
! O

I O
will O
have O
to O
do O
more O
research O
before O
checking O
out O
new O
places O
based O
on O
Diners O
, O
drive O
- O
ins O
and O
dives O
reviews O
. O

I O
noice O
most O
reviews O
mention O
the O
bad O
service O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
ok O
, O
but O
the O
service B-AS
was O
so O
poor O
that O
the O
food B-AS
was O
cold O
buy O
the O
time O
everyone O
in O
my O
party O
was O
served O
. O

Even O
then O
, O
the O
order O
was O
not O
correct O
and O
we O
were O
still O
waiting O
for O
a O
couple O
items O
. O

We O
had O
a O
very O
hard O
time O
getting O
the O
waitress B-AS
attention O
and O
finally O
had O
to O
get O
up O
and O
go O
inside O
to O
speak O
to O
a O
manager O
. O

As O
it O
turns O
out O
the O
owner B-AS
was O
seated O
right O
next O
to O
us O
and O
when O
he O
came O
over O
to O
check O
on O
our O
problems O
was O
very O
dismissive O
and O
offered O
a O
token O
20 O
% O
discount O
on O
our O
bill O
. O

When O
the O
bill O
came O
, O
he O
only O
took O
the O
discount O
off O
the O
food O
and O
not O
the O
drinks O
. O

It O
was O
clear O
he O
did O
n't O
really O
care O
. O

With O
so O
many O
great O
breakfast O
/ O
lunch O
places O
in O
So O
Cal O
, O
this O
one O
is O
not O
worth O
the O
wait O
or O
any O
extra O
effort O
to O
visit O
. O

AVOID O
THE O
PLACE B-AS

Save O
yourself O
the O
waste O
of O
time O
& O
DO O
NOT O
visit O
. O

I O
made O
my O
1st O
trip O
to O
the O
restaurant O
after O
finding O
their O
webpage O
online O
. O

When O
I O
got O
there O
I O
sat O
up O
stairs O
where O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
was O
cozy O
& O
the O
service B-AS
was O
horrible O
! O

I O
waited O
for O
10 O
- O
15 O
minutes O
for O
service B-AS
ordered O
a O
beer O
& O
was O
never O
served O
again O
. O

After O
sitting O
there O
with O
my O
empty O
glass O
for O
over O
20 O
minutes O
I O
left O
. O

I O
went O
home O
& O
looked O
them O
up O
online O
again O
where O
I O
discovered O
there O
is O
a O
link O
for O
a O
give O
away O
that O
does O
n't O
work O
so O
emailed O
the O
restaurant B-AS
about O
the O
non O
existent O
service O
& O
deceptive O
link O
. O

I O
never O
heard O
back O
from O
anyone O
more O
than O
a O
month O
ago O
. O

After O
telling O
my O
friend O
about O
the O
situation O
he O
said O
lets O
try O
again O
but O
we O
will O
visit O
the O
lower O
bar O
. O

After O
sitting O
at O
the O
bar O
for O
over O
20 O
minutes O
the O
bar B-AS
keep I-AS
had O
made O
only O
2 O
drinks O
& O
kept O
telling O
us O
she O
'd O
be O
right O
with O
us O
. O

We O
left O
without O
ever O
getting O
service B-AS
. O

As O
of O
writing O
this O
I O
just O
tried O
their O
give O
away O
a O
link O
again O
& O
it O
still O
does O
n't O
work O
. O

There O
are O
so O
many O
better O
places O
to O
visit O
! O

Best O
Crab B-AS
Cakes I-AS
in O
Town O

That O
s O
a O
big O
statement O
considering O
I O
' O
ve O
been O
pulling O
crab O
traps O
and O
making O
the O
cakes B-AS
myself O
since O
I O
was O
about O
seven O
, O
but O
something O
about O
these O
little O
devils O
gets O
better O
every O
time O
. O

If O
you O
can O
, O
come O
to O
this O
place B-AS
by O
boat O
and O
make O
it O
a O
whole O
evening O
. O

Great O

Great O

Poor O
Service B-AS

Love O
their O
pizza B-AS
, O
especially O
the O
mushroom O
pizza B-AS
. O

Also O
love O
their O
caeser B-AS
salad I-AS
. O

Prefer O
to O
order O
it O
and O
pick O
it O
up O
though O
because O
I O
do O
n't O
like O
the O
servers B-AS
, O
one O
young B-AS
woman I-AS
in O
particular O
. O

She O
does O
n't O
make O
you O
feel O
welcome O
and O
treats O
you O
like O
an O
annoyance O
. O

But O
she O
is O
very O
friendly O
with O
certain O
people O
, O
making O
it O
even O
more O
annoying O
. O

Management B-AS
should O
really O
take O
notice O
and O
train O
their O
waitstaff B-AS
and O
teach O
them O
some O
proper O
manners O
. O

Many O
people O
talk O
about O
the O
great O
pizza B-AS
and O
poor O
service B-AS
, O
so O
it O
ca O
n't O
just O
be O
the O
rantings O
of O
a O
few O
dissatisfied O
customers O
. O

It O
's O
a O
great O
little O
place B-AS
with O
tons O
of O
potential O
to O
be O
a O
neighborhood O
joint O
if O
the O
service B-AS
were O
n't O
so O
impersonal O
and O
corporate O
- O
like O
. O

Great O

They O
have O
been O

and O
they O
deserve O
it O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
great O
and O
they O
make O
a O
mean O
bloody B-AS
mary I-AS
. O

I O
love O
breakfast B-AS
here O
. O

Their O
crab B-AS
eggs I-AS
benedict I-AS
is O
addicting O
. O

All O
their O
menu B-AS
items I-AS
are O
a O
hit O
, O
and O
they O
serve O
mimosas O
. O

Does O
n't O
get O
any O
better O
than O
that O
. O

best O
chinese B-AS
food I-AS
i O
have O
tasted O
in O
a O
long O
time O

we O
got O
a O
groupon O
for O
pagoda O
and O
decided O
to O
try O
it O
on O
a O
thursday O
night O
. O

there O
was O
a O
guy O
playing O
the O
piano O
and O
singing O
at O
the O
bar O
area O
which O
was O
separate O
from O
the O
dinning O
area O
. O

You O
can O
easily O
hear O
him O
though O
so O
it O
was O
a O
pleasant O
sound O
and O
not O
overbearing O
. O

the O
ambiance B-AS
of O
the O
restaurant O
was O
nice O
and O
good O
for O
fine O
dinning O
. O

not O
too O
fine O
thought O
that O
you O
feel O
uncomfortable O
and O
have O
to O
dress O
up O
. O

the O
staff B-AS
was O
very O
nice O
and O
courteous O
and O
obviously O
chinese O
. O

we O
ordered O
the O
honey O
walnut O
prawns O
which O
we O
always O
order O
at O
every O
chinese O
restaurant O
to O
determine O
the O
quality O
of O
food O
. O

First O
off O
, O
the O
food O
came O
fast O
and O
all O
together O
, O
i O
like O
that O
i O
hate O
the O
pretentiousness O
of O
things O
coming O
in O
one O
after O
the O
other O
. O

so O
about O
the O
prawns B-AS
, O
they O
were O
fresh O
and O
had O
a O
slight O
crispiness O
about O
the O
batter B-AS
soooo O
good O
the O
walnuts B-AS
were O
cut O
in O
smaller O
pieces O
and O
very O
crunchy O
and O
tasty O
. O

yummy O
. O

best O
honey B-AS
walnyt I-AS
prawns I-AS
that O
we O
have O
every O
tasted O
. O

next O
one O
that O
we O
ordered O
were O
prawns O
and O
scallop O
with O
brocolli O
. O

the O
brocollis B-AS
were O
so O
fresh O
and O
tasty O
. O

i O
would O
normally O
not O
finish O
the O
brocolli B-AS
when O
i O
order O
these O
kinds O
of O
food O
but O
for O
the O
first O
time O
, O
every O
piece O
was O
as O
eventful O
as O
the O
first O
one O
the O
scallops B-AS
and O
prawns B-AS
was O
so O
fresh O
and O
nicely O
cooked O
. O

not O
chewy O
at O
all O
. O

for O
desert O
we O
had O
the O
mango B-AS
ginger I-AS
creme I-AS
brulee I-AS
oh O
la O
la O
yummy O
! O
! O
! O
. O

melt O
in O
your O
mouth O
. O

we O
are O
for O
sure O
coming O
back O
to O
this O
restaurant B-AS
. O

every O
month O
if O
possible O
. O

it O
is O
sad O
there O
is O
not O
many O
people O
who O
frequent O
eating O
at O
places O
like O
these O
that O
look O
pricey O
because O
they O
are O
at O
the O
hotel O
but O
they O
are O
definitely O
one O
you O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
miss O
, O
esp O
if O
your O
in O
downtown O
san O
jose O
. O

Chintzy O
portions B-AS

The O
sushi B-AS
here O
is O
perfectly O
good O
, O
but O
for O
$ O
5 O
a O
piece O
, O
either O
the O
slices O
of O
fish O
should O
be O
larger O
, O
or O
there O
should O
be O
no O
pretense O
that O
this O
is O
a O
moderately O
priced O
restaurant B-AS
even O
for O
NYC O
. O

We O
easily O
spent O
more O
than O
$ O
40 O
per O
person O
not O
including O
alcohol O
and O
were O
still O
hungry O
. O

I O
' O
m O
astonished O
that O
this O
restaurant B-AS
is O
categorized O
as O
$ O
$ O
$ O
rather O
than O
$ O
$ O
$ O
$ O
. O

Terrible O
service B-AS
, O
food B-AS
ok O
, O
pricey O

This O
past O
weekend O
had O
great O
weather O
for O
San O
Francisco O
standards O
. O

So O
for O
the O
after O
beach O
excursion O
' O
, O
we O
thought O
we O
would O
end O
the O
day O
on O
a O
high O
note O
and O
make O
the O
trip O
across O
the O
street O
from O
the O
beach O
to O
Park O
Chalet O
. O

The O
restaurant O
was O
busy O
, O
however O
there O
were O
a O
few O
tables O
open O
. O

We O
put O
out O
name O
down O
and O
although O
there O
were O
open O
tables O
we O
were O
told O
that O
it O
'd O
be O
a O
30 O
minute O
wait O
. O

So O
here O
we O
are O
, O
my O
wife O
, O
3 O
year O
old O
daughter O
and O
I O
trying O
to O
pass O
the O
time O
by O
hanging O
out O
in O
the O
front O
of O
the O
building O
where O
the O
murals O
and O
artifacts O
are O
. O

30 O
minutes O
went O
by O
and O
sure O
enough O
the O
pager O
buzzer O
went O
off O
. O

We O
went O
back O
to O
the O
restaurant O
and O
low O
and O
behold O
, O
we O
were O
seated O
at O
one O
of O
the O
tables O
that O
was O
available O
30 O
minutes O
ago O
! O
! O

Logic O
behind O
that O
? O

None O
that O
I O
can O
think O
of O
. O

We O
put O
in O
our O
order O
and O
although O
we O
ordered O
4 O
appetizers O
, O
the O
food O
did O
n't O
arrive O
until O
45 O
minutes O
laterWITH O
OUR O
MAIN O
COURSE O
. O

Um O
so O
now O
what O
are O
appetizers O
for O
? O
? O
? O

Oh O
I O
forgot O
to O
mention O
that O
they O
do O
n't O
have O
bread O
service O
. O

Its O
a O
good O
thing O
my O
daughter O
had O
some O
snacks O
in O
her O
lunch O
bag O
. O

My O
wife O
also O
ordered O
a O
teapot O
of O
hot O
water O
she O
had O
a O
sore O
throat O
and O
I O
guess O
that O
since O
it O
was O
only O
water O
, O
it O
was O
n't O
a O
priority O
for O
them O
to O
actually O
bring O
it O
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
if O
they O
are O
n't O
making O
$ O
$ O
off O
of O
you O
then O
you O
do O
n't O
rate O
high O
on O
their O
service B-AS
scale O
' O
. O

Food B-AS
wise O
, O
its O
ok O
but O
a O
bit O
pricey O
for O
what O
you O
get O
considering O
the O
restaurant B-AS
is O
n't O
a O
fancy O
place O
. O

The O
upside O
of O
the O
restaurant O
? O

If O
I O
needed O
to O
name O
some O
they O
would O
include O
the O
location B-AS
to O
the O
beach O
or O
Golden O
Gate O
park O
. O

Its O
great O
if O
you O
spent O
the O
day O
there O
and O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
drive O
to O
eat O
. O

Parking O
is O
reasonably O
good O
, O
they O
have O
their O
own O
lot O
and O
you O
can O
park O
in O
the O
park O
nearby O
. O

Another O
plus O
is O
the O
open O
feel B-AS
of O
the O
restaurant O
with O
glass B-AS
walls I-AS
on O
all O
sides O
. O

I O
'd O
hate O
for O
tourists O
to O
go O
to O
Park O
Chalet O
and O
think O
that O
this O
is O
how O
all O
San O
Francisco O
restaurants O
are O
like O
. O

Always O
good O
. O

A O
sushi O
- O
fiend O
friend O
recently O
visited O
and O
our O
group O
of O
three O
just O
had O
to O
come O
for O
dinner O
. O

6 O
pm O
on O
a O
Sat O
before O
a O
Broadway O
play O
and O
we O
were O
quickly O
seated O
and O
served O
. O

Amazing O

Mackeral I-AS

and O
perfect O

um O
. O

As O
usual O
the O
omikase B-AS
did O
n't O
disappoint O
in O
freshness O
, O
although O
it O
scored O
low O
on O
creativity O
and O
selection O
. O

Their O
specialty B-AS
rolls I-AS
are O
impressive O
, O
though O
I O
ca O
n't O
remember O
what O
we O
had O
. O

Great O
selection B-AS
of I-AS

Green B-AS

each O
time O
I O
have O
it O
. O

It O
is O
n't O
the O
cheapest O
sushi B-AS
but O
has O
been O
worth O
it O
every O
time O
. O

Very O
poor O
customer B-AS
service I-AS
. O

Schooner O
or O
Later O
's O
charming O
location B-AS
along I-AS
the I-AS
marina I-AS
in I-AS
Long I-AS
Beach I-AS
and O
average O
food B-AS
does O
not O
, O
unfortunately O
, O
compensate O
for O
its O
very O
poor O
customer B-AS
service I-AS
. O

While O
this O
diner O
had O
reasonably O
good O
food B-AS
, O
the O
restaurant B-AS
staff I-AS
seemed O
completely O
indifferent O
to O
our O
presence O
, O
and O
this O
attitude O
was O
reflected O
in O
the O
lack O
of O
service O
. O

As O
part O
of O
a O
small O
party O
of O
four O
, O
our O
food O
was O
dropped O
off O
without O
comment O
; O

any O
further O
needs O
we O
may O
have O
had O
could O
not O
have O
been O
met O
since O
no O
one O
stopped O
by O
the O
table O
. O

When O
we O
finally O
were O
able O
to O
flag O
someone O
down O
, O
it O
was O
someone O
entirely O
different O
from O
the O
person O
who O
had O
dropped O
off O
the O
food O
, O
who O
was O
also O
not O
the O
same O
person O
who O
had O
taken O
our O
order O
. O

After O
one O
member O
of O
our O
party O
had O
been O
bumped O
repeatedly O
by O
a O
waitress B-AS
, O
a O
polite O
request O
that O
he O
not O
be O
bumped O
sent O
the O
waitress B-AS
into O
an O
abusive O
rant O
. O

A O
brief O
conversation O
with O
the O
manager B-AS
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
meal O
was O
the O
greatest O
disappointment O
-- O
to O
say O
we O
had O
been O
blown O
off O
would O
be O
an O
understatement O
. O

The O
manager B-AS
continually O
interrupted O
with O
Is O
there O
anything O
else O
I O
can O
do O
for O
you O
? O
, O
a O
strange O
comment O
because O
she O
had O
hardly O
listened O
, O
let O
alone O
responded O
to O
our O
expression O
of O
disappointment O
at O
our O
experience O
. O

She O
promised O
to O
speak O
to O
the O
waitress O
who O
had O
flown O
off O
in O
a O
rage O
, O
but O
we O
could O
hardly O
take O
her O
promise O
seriously O
, O
seeing O
as O
she O
had O
n't O
bothered O
to O
get O
the O
waitresses O
name O
. O

In O
short O
, O
Schooner O
or O
Later O
could O
n't O
have O
cared O
less O
about O
our O
being O
at O
their O
establishment O
. O

Next O
time O
we O
will O
go O
somewhere O
else O
, O
or O
try O
other O
restaurants O
close O
by O
like O
Mimi O
's O
Cafe O
and O
Claim O

with O
the O

I O
decided O
to O
eat O
at O
Stack O
because O
of O
their O
price B-AS
fixed I-AS
pre I-AS
- I-AS
show I-AS
dinner I-AS
. O

When O
I O
walked O
in O
, O
I O
was O
taken O
aback O
by O
their O
incredible O
wood B-AS
decor I-AS
. O

The O
music B-AS
playing O
was O
very O
hip O
, O
20 O
- O
30 O
something O
pop O
music B-AS
, O
but O
the O
subwoofer B-AS
to I-AS
the I-AS
sound I-AS
system I-AS
was O
located O
under O
my O
seat O
, O
which O
became O
annoying O
midway O
through O
dinner O
. O

We O
were O
quickly O
seated O
and O
requested O
the O
special O
dinner O
, O
which O
came O
with O
, O
1 O
Shellfish O
and O
Shrimp O
appetizer O
or O
Caesar O
Salad O
, O
2 O
9 O
oz O
steak O
with O
a O
single O
potato O
chip O
, O
and O
3 O
homemade O
donut O
holes O
. O

I O
got O
the O
shellfish B-AS
and I-AS
shrimp I-AS
appetizer I-AS
and O
it O
was O
alright O
. O

It O
was O
n't O
the O
freshest O
seafood B-AS
ever O
, O
but O
the O
taste O
and O
presentation O
was O
OK O
. O

Before O
the O
steak O
came O
, O
the O
server O
told O
us O
that O
the O
steak O
did O
not O
come O
with O
any O
sides O
and O
suggested O
I O
pick O
something O
from O
the O
menu O
. O

I O
picked O
the O
asparagus B-AS
, O
which O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
incredible O
and O
perfectly O
prepared O
. O

It O
was O
steamed O
and O
tossed O
with O
garlic O
. O

The O
9 B-AS
oz I-AS
steak I-AS
came O
next O
and O
it O
tasted O
great O
, O
at O
least O
initially O
. O

The O
steak B-AS
was O
done O
to O
my O
exact O
liking O
medium O
rare O
and O
was O
nice O
and O
juicy O
. O

It O
? O
s O
served O
with O
either O
a O
peppercorn B-AS
sauce I-AS
or O
red B-AS
wine I-AS
reduction I-AS
, O
though O
both O
were O
indistinguishable O
in O
taste O
. O

Though O
, O
one O
thing O
I O
realized O
later O
on O
was O
that O
the O
restaurant O
either O
used O
MSG O
or O
a O
meat O
tenderizer O
on O
the O
steak B-AS
. O

My O
mouth O
felt O
very O
dry O
afterwards O
and O
I O
had O
that O
signature O
? O
MSG O
? O
taste O
lingering O
in O
my O
throat O
after O
I O
left O
the O
restaurant O
. O

Finally O
, O
the O
homemade O
donut O
holes O
were O
served O
for O
desert O
. O

They O
came O
in O
their O
own O
nifty O
take O
out O
box O
and O
with O
some O
homemade O
frosting O
; O
very O
light O
and O
not O
- O
too O
- O
sweet O
. O

The O
desert B-AS
was O
the O
perfect O
ending O
to O
an O
almost O
perfect O
dinner B-AS
. O

The O
dinner O
only O
took O
us O
about O
an O
hour O
and O
the O
prices O
were O
alright O
for O
the O
strip O
, O
almost O
$ O
50 O
/ O
pp O
after O
tax O
and O
tip O
about O
average O
. O

But O
the O
servers B-AS
were O
extremely O
attentive O
and O
very O
friendly O
. O

Overall O
, O
I O
would O
go O
back O
and O
eat O
at O
the O
restaurant B-AS
again O
. O

Just O
remember O
to O
dress O
a O
little O
urban O
- O
chic O
so O
you O
don O
? O
t O
look O
too O
far O
out O
of O

good O
food B-AS
, O
i O
honestly O
do O
n't O
know O
much O
about O
japanese O
food B-AS
at O
all O
. O

In O
the O
past O
sake O
usuallly O
just O
tasted O
kind O
of O
like O
salty O
water O
to O
me O
. O

Server B-AS
made O
several O
sake B-AS
suggestions O
which O
were O
very O
good O
. O

had O
many O

but O
the O
BEST O
was O

VERY O
GOOD O
! O

Overpriced O

We O
dined O
at O
the O
Colorado O
location O
today O
. O

Waited O
35 O
minutes O
for O
a O
table O
for O
8 O
which O
was O
ok O
for O
such O
a O
big O
crowd O
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
was O
a O
bit O
unfriendly O
and O
the O
feel B-AS
of O
the O
restaurant O
was O
crowded O
. O

Also O
, O
there O
was O
only O
one O
bathroom B-AS
stall I-AS
probably O
need O
more O
for O
such O
big O
crowds O
. O

Most O
importantly O
, O
we O
were O
so O
excited O
about O
the O
food O
after O
seeing O
the O
very O
creative O
menu B-AS
. O

At O
best O
, O
the O
food B-AS
was O
good O
and O
definately O
overpriced O
. O

For O
the O
amount O
of O
food B-AS
we O
got O
the O
prices O
should O
have O
been O
lower O
. O

Not O
sure O
if O
I O
would O
go O
back O
. O

My O
favortie O
pizza B-AS
joint I-AS
in O
Seattle O

This O
is O
my O
must O
bring O
out O
of O
town O
guests O
to O
restaurant B-AS
and O
they O
always O
enjoy O
and O
rave O
about O
it O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
many O
want O
to O
return O
a O
second O
time O
during O
their O
visit O
. O

The O
pizza B-AS
is O
delicious O
and O
the O
salads B-AS
are O
fantastic O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
always O
found O
the O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
and O
, O
if O
you O
sit O
at O
the O
bar O
, O
the O
cooks B-AS
very O
friendly O
. O

They O
are O
n't O
the O
most O
talkative O
, O
but O
everytime O
I O
' O
ve O
been O
there O
they O
have O
been O
very O
busy O
, O
which O
probably O
accounts O
for O
the O
lack O
of O
conversation O
. O

I O
also O
really O
enjoy O
the O
simplicity O
of O
the O
decor B-AS
and O
intimate O
feeling B-AS
of O
a O
small O
restaurant O
. O

It O
's O
just O
the O
right O
size O
for O
the O
menu O
. O

Excellent O

My O
husband O
and O
I O

We O
're O

say O
enough O
about O

delicious O
gourmet O
pizza B-AS

! O

You O
wo O
n't O
be O
disappointed O
by O
their O
menu B-AS
. O

The O
pizza B-AS
's I-AS
are O
thin O
crust O
and O
the O
menu B-AS
offers O
very O
creative O
combinations O
and O
toppings O
. O

You O
never O
feel O
icky O
and O
stuffed O
after O
you O
eat O
there O
. O

The O
pizza B-AS
's I-AS
are O
light O
and O
scrumptious O
. O

It O
's O
a O
salad O
on O
top O
of O

crust O
. O

Absolutely O
delicious O
. O

The O
pizza B-AS
's I-AS
are O
not O
huge O
and O
the O
crust B-AS
is O
thin O
keep O
that O
in O
mind O
when O
you O
're O
ordering O
. O

Worth O
the O
wait O

Had O
to O
wait O
thirty O
minutes O
to O
get O
in O
the O
door O
on O
a O
tuesday O
morning O
, O
but O
it O
was O
so O
worth O
it O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
sinful O
. O

The O
staff B-AS
was O
really O
friendly O
. O

The O
specialty O
here O
is O
decadent O
pancakes B-AS
, O
but O
I O
' O
ve O
been O
back O
now O
four O
times O

and O
I O
' O
ve O
been O
wowed O
every O
time O

Nothing O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
is O
less O
than O
amazing O
. O

Go O
with O
some O
friends O
, O
wait O
the O
half O
hour O
or O
so O
with O
a O
cup O
of O
joe O

enjoy O
more O
than O

I O

it O

BAD O

good O
for O
that O
one O
night O
once O
in O
a O
blue O
moon O
when O
the O
chefs O
decide O
to O
use O
fish B-AS
that O
's O
half O
- O
way O
decent O
. O

I O
have O
been O
here O
, O
spent O
tons O
of O
money O
on O
a O
chef B-AS
special I-AS
dinner I-AS
and O
it O
was O
a O
major O
dissappointment O

on O
a O
$ O
100 O

Delectable O

It O

there O
before O
8 O
pm O
on O
a O

you O
will O
find O
it O
easier O
to O

or O
a O

at O
the O

. O

Once O
you O
're O
inside O

the O

experience O
begins O
. O

Everything O
, O
and O
I O
mean O
everything O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
is O
delectable O
. O

The O
waiters B-AS
are O
very O
experienced O
and O
helpful O
with O
pairing O
your O
drink O
choice O
to O
your O
food O
tastes O
or O
vice O

The O
sushi B-AS
is O
as O
fresh O

? O
you O
'd O
think O

The O

Yum O

The O
pizza B-AS
itself O
is O
not O
exactly O
the O
best O
I O
' O
ve O
had O
EVER O
, O
but O
still O
pretty O
good O
. O

I O
probably O
would O
n't O
go O
back O
though O
cuz O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
it O
's O
worth O
it O
. O

Maybe O
I O
'll O
go O
back O
once O
more O
many O
years O
from O
now O
when O
I O
' O
ve O
forgotten O
I O
went O
there O
already O
. O

Sit O
in O
the O
Balcony B-AS

Not O
bad O
. O

Food B-AS
was O
good O
and O
appetizing O
. O

Portions B-AS
was O
just O
enough O
for O
me O
, O
but O
may O
not O
be O
for O
a O
big O
eater O
. O

Fair O
menu B-AS
selection I-AS
. O

The O
appetizer B-AS
was O
interesting O
, O
but O
the O
Creme B-AS
Brulee I-AS
was O
very O
savory O
and O
delicious O
. O

Indoor B-AS
ambience I-AS
was O
modern O
. O

If O
it O
's O
nice O
outside O
, O
request O
for O
a O
table O
in O
the O
balcony B-AS
. O

It O
's O
a O
great O
place B-AS
to O
people O
watch O
. O

Although O
the O
service B-AS
could O
be O
improved O
considering O
the O
money O
you O
put O
in O
. O

Our O
drinks O
kept O
coming O
but O
our O
server B-AS
came O
by O
a O
couple O
times O
. O

Should O
check O
- O
up O
on O
us O
more O
frequently O
, O
do O
n't O
you O
think O
? O

Late O
night O
dinning O
with O
exeptional O
food B-AS
. O

I O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
go O
there O
because O
of O
the O
reviews O
and O
prices O
I O
saw O
on O
the O
internet O
. O

That O
was O
the O
last O
night O
in O
Vegas O
and O
was O
too O
late O
and O
most O
of O
the O
restaurant O
were O
closing O
, O
so O
we O
walked O
in O
the O
check O
the O
place O
. O

We O
were O
seated O
right O
away O
, O
the O
table B-AS
was O
private O
and O
nice O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
exceptional O
, O
sometime O
there O
was O
a O
feeling O
that O
we O
were O
served O
by O
the O
army O
of O
friendly O
waiters B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
very O
good O
, O
filet B-AS
mignon I-AS
was O
probably O
the O
best O
I O
' O
ve O
ever O
try O
. O

The O
portions B-AS
are O
big O
though O
, O
so O
do O
not O
order O
too O
much O
. O

Groovy O
music B-AS
made O
the O
dinner O
casual O
. O

The O
most O
pleasant O
surprise O
was O
the O
check O
that O
did O
not O
exceed O
my O
expectations O
as O
it O
always O
happens O
in O
most O
of O
the O
places O
. O

I O
have O
a O
but O
here O
, O
there O
was O
a O
bathroom O
attendant O
in O
the O
restroom B-AS
which O
was O
odd O
. O

The O
bathroom B-AS
itself O
is O
very O
small O
with O
two O
toilets O
and O
only O
one O
sink O
, O
the O
girl O
was O
staying O
totally O
on O
the O
way O
hanging O
out O
paper O
towels O
from O
the O
dispenser O
. O

There O
were O
3 O
bottles O
of O
perfume O
on O
the O
sink O
and O
the O
line O
of O
girls O
trying O
to O
use O
the O
sink O
. O

I O
felt O
ackward O
and O
next O
time O
went O
to O
the O
casino O
bathroom O
. O

This O
place B-AS
rocks O
! O
! O

Mercedes O
restaurant O
is O
so O
tasty O
, O
the O
service B-AS
is O
undeniably O
awesome O
! O

The O
chips B-AS
and I-AS
salsa I-AS
are O
so O
yummy O
, O
and O
the O
prices O
are O
fabulous O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
aspiring O
, O
and O
the O
decor B-AS
is O
festive O
and O
amazing O
. O

The O
catering B-AS
is O
out O
of O

world O
, O
and O
Raouls B-AS
chicken I-AS
vegetable I-AS
soup I-AS
rocks O
my O
world O
! O
! O
! O

Drinks B-AS
are O
suberb O

and O
I O
feel O
like O
I O
am O
in O
a O
Third O
World O
country O
when O
I O
walk O
in O
the O

Insultingly O
Overpriced O

Mediocre O
Service B-AS

This O
review O
is O
for O
the O
Southglen O
location O
which O
is O
not O
listed O
in O
Citysearch O
, O
I O
wish O
this O
review O
would O
make O
a O
difference O
enough O
for O
it O
to O
be O
addressed O
by O
management O
but O
Snooze O
has O
people O
climbing O
over O
each O
other O
for O
a O
chance O
to O
eat O
at O
this O
overpriced O
restaurant O
with O
mediocre O
food O
and O
service O
, O
so O
this O
review O
as O
well O
as O
the O
other O
negative O
ones O
for O
their O
Larimer O
location O
will O
go O
unaddressed O
. O

The O
presentation O
of O
Snooze B-AS
is O
excellent O
and O
it O
is O
one O
of O
those O
places O
that O
you O
feel O
more O
sophisticated O
just O
for O
being O
there O
; O
but O
peel O
back O
the O
layers O
and O
you O
have O
an O
overpriced O
IHOP O
with O
a O
high O
brow O
menu B-AS
. O

To O
start O
off O
, O
approximately O
8 O
- O
10 O
oz O
of O
orange B-AS
juice I-AS
will O
cost O
you O
$ O
3 O
. O

They O
serve O
it O
in O
a O
tall O
, O
skinny O
hour O
- O
glass O
shaped O
glass O
to O
disguise O
the O
fact O
that O
you O
a O
getting O
a O
small O
juice B-AS
at O
the O
price O
of O
a O
half O
gallon O
in O
a O
supermarket O
. O

I O
should O
have O
just O
asked O
for O
the O
check O
when O
I O
saw O
that O
; O
but O
their O
menu B-AS
was O
so O
unique O
that O
I O
continued O
. O

The O
pancakes B-AS
were O
certainly O
inventive O
but O
$ O
850 O
for O
3 O
, O
6 O
pancakes B-AS
one O
of O
them O
was O
more O
like O
5 O
in O
the O
pancake O
flight O
sample O
of O
3 O
different O
pancakes B-AS
is O
well O
over O
- O
priced O
. O

The O
pancakes B-AS
should O
be O
larger O
at O
least O
8 O
to O
justify O
the O
expense O
even O
with O
the O
unique O
offerings O
. O

The O
flavors O
were O
good O
but O
I O
have O
had O
far O
better O
pancakes O
at O
a O
German O
pancake O
specialty O
restaurant O
that O
were O
a O
little O
cheaper O
but O
significan'tly O
larger O
. O

On O
my O
meal B-AS
I O
had O
to O
send O
back O
my O
eggs B-AS
for O
a O
simple O
request O
of O
breaking O
the O
yokes O
before O
cooking O
, O
and O
would O
have O
had O
to O
send O
them O
back O
again O
if O
I O
had O
n't O
rejected O
the O
meal B-AS
all O
together O
. O

I O
rejected O
it O
because O
in O
the O
process O
of O
attempting O
to O
fix O
the O
eggs O
they O
broke O
something O
else O
in O
the O
dish B-AS
and O
I O
was O
too O
frustrated O
to O
continue O
. O

To O
their O
credit O
they O
removed O
the O
dish O
from O
the O
check O
; O
but O
no O
manager B-AS
stopped O
by O
to O
ask O
what O
the O
problem O
was O
. O

In O
the O
end O
our O
check O
came O
to O
$ O
27 O
for O
4 O
small O
pancakes B-AS
, O
a O
breakfast B-AS
burrito I-AS
, O
an O
orange B-AS
juice I-AS
and O
an O
iced B-AS
tea I-AS
I O
had O
water O
. O

This O
was O
2 O
times O
what O
the O
same O
meal O
would O
have O
cost O
at O
Le O
Peep O
. O

Snooze O
provided O
an O
inventive O
pancake O
offering O
, O
but O
Le O
Peep O
would O
have O
provided O
better O
service O
and O
quality O
. O

Much O
more O
than O
just O
a O
great O
view B-AS
! O

I O
am O
exceedingly O
pleased O
to O
report O
that O
my O
dinner O
at O
Ray B-AS
's I-AS
Boathouse I-AS
last O
Friday O
completely O
exceeded O
my O
expectations O
. O

Ray O
's O
is O
something O
of O
a O
Seattle O
institution O
, O
but O
given O
its O
gorgeous O
Sound B-AS
views I-AS
, O
I O
had O
suspected O
that O
the O
accolades O
were O
more O
due O
to O
the O
scenery O
than O
to O
the O
food O
and O
service O
. O

Imagine O
my O
happy O
surprise O
upon O
finding O
that O
the O
views B-AS
are O
only O
the O
third O
- O
best O
thing O
about O
Ray B-AS
's I-AS
! O

To O
start O
things O
off O
, O
our O
lovely O
server O
Brooke B-AS
was O
quickly O
on O
hand O
to O
take O
my O
drink O
order O
. O

My O
party O
of O
two O
was O
feeling O
particularly O
ambitious O
, O
and O
we O
splurged O
on O
the O
Shilshole B-AS
Sampler I-AS
beautiful O
assortment O
of O
enormous O
white B-AS
gulf I-AS
prawns I-AS
, O
smoked O
albacore O
tuna O
, O
Ray O
's O
fantastic O
manila B-AS
clams I-AS
seasoned O
with O
dill O
, O
scallops O
in O
a O
tasty O
soy B-AS
dressing I-AS
, O
and O
a O
tiny O
pile O
of O
Dungeness O
crab O
atop O
a O
sublime O
butter B-AS
sauce I-AS
. O

For O
my O
entr O
& O
eacute O
; O
e O
, O
I O
completely O
enjoyed O
the O
seared B-AS
Alaskan I-AS
sea I-AS
scallops I-AS
complemented O
by O
chard O
, O
artichoke O
hearts O
, O
fennel O
, O
and O
pecorino O
toscano O
. O

The O
scallops B-AS
are O
apparently O
cooked O
in O
a O
black O
olive O
butter O
which O
really O
makes O
them O
unique O
not O
to O
mention O
tasty O
. O

My O
friend O
enjoyed O
the O
grilled B-AS
Alaskan I-AS
King I-AS
Salmon I-AS
with O
delectable O
creamed B-AS
Washington I-AS
russet I-AS
potatoes I-AS
and O
crisp O
green B-AS
beans I-AS
. O

I O
had O
a O
taste O
of O
all O
three O
items O
on O
her O
plate B-AS
, O
and O
they O
were O
superb O
. O

Our O
server B-AS
continued O
to O
be O
attentive O
throughout O
the O
night O
, O
but O
I O
did O
remain O
puzzled O
by O
one O
issue O
, O
Who O
thinks O
that O
Ray B-AS
's I-AS
is O
an O
appropriate O
place O
to O
take O
young O
children O
for O
dinner O
? O

Two O
rascally O
kids O
were O
seated O
near O
us O
for O
the O
first O
part O
of O
our O
dinnerthey O
were O
replaced O
by O
a O
delightful O
preteen O
who O
pretended O
to O
gag O
every O
time O
seafood O
was O
mentioned O
at O
her O
table O
. O

Given O
that O
Ray O
's O
is O
a O
seafood O
restaurantwell O
, O
you O
get O
the O
idea O
. O

All O
considered O
, O
I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
Ray B-AS
's I-AS
Boathouse I-AS
is O
deserving O
of O
its O
title O
as O
a O
Seattle O
institution O
. O

While O
I O
could O
have O
done O
without O
the O
youth O
who O
shared O
the O
evening O
with O
us O
, O
our O
wonderful O
server B-AS
and O
food B-AS
made O
the O
experience O
a O
very O
positive O
one O
. O

Oh O
yeahthe O
view B-AS
was O
good O
, O
too O
. O
